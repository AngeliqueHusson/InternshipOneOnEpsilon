hi rob welcom math antic lesson go learn anoth import geometri quantiti cal led volum specif go learn volum kind use measur volum calcul volum simpl geometr first thing need know volum quantiti object understand mean help back littl start object like line segment measur object need quantiti usual call length length line happen exactli one centimet common unit measur length math antic video area saw move extend line direct perpendicular distanc one centimet form object cal led object measur quantiti call area origin line one centimet long extend distanc one centimet amount area squar one squar centimet common unit measur area imagin take squar move extend direct perpendicular surfac distanc centimet form object cal led cube measur object like use quantiti cal led volum volum tell us much space space object much volum cube well sinc made extend squar centimet distanc one centimet dimens say volum exactli one cubic centimet common unit measur volum squar use measur area cubic use measur volum sinc squar made multipli two togeth like centimet time centimet abbrevi expon notat centimet power centimet squar sinc cubic made multipli three togeth like centimet time centimet time centimet abbrevi expon notat centimet power centimet cube like differ size squar like squar inch es squar squar also differ size cubic like cubic inch es cubic cubic mi lesse area squar relat volum cubic anoth similar rememb use squar measur area shape squar well use cubic measur volum shape see work take look circl object cal led sphere like ball like bunch small squar approxim area circl use bunch small approxim volum sphere realli cool smaller squar use closer combin area match area circl smaller use closer combin volum match volum volum quantiti measur object sinc also tal ked lot area video want point object also type area want confus volum might rememb previou video quantiti cal led area quantiti cal led perimet well similar way object quantiti cal led volum quantiti cal led cal led surfac area surfac area lot like area object outer surfac shell perimet surfac area outer geometr outer boundari shape surfac area outer boundari shape help see differ surfac area volum imagin perfectli thin box fill ice unfold box see area surround volum volum amount space ice insid box alright understand volum confus surfac area go spend rest video learn calcul volum basic geometr want quickli mention someth import terminolog word use describ thing math time peopl agre call thing math away sand especi true come word use describ dimens geometr object stake word length width height exampl rectangl could name two dimens length width like area video could also name width height wan ted actual dimens realli import differ might use differ import thing flexibl realiz math concept even differ word use explain exampl area rectangl alway found multipli two side dimens togeth matter back calcul lot form take shape extend along third dimens exampl start rectangl extend along third dimens get shape cal led rectangular prism start triangl extend along third dimens get shape cal led triangular prism start circl extend along third dimens get shape cal led cylind might thought cal led circular prism technic prism form extend polygon sinc circl polygon result shape cal led good news gener formula calcul volum type shape find area origin shape got extend multipli length distanc extend usual origin shape cal led base object let start rectangular prism calcul volum base origin rectangl dimens centimet find area base need rememb calcul area rectangl multipli two side dimens centimet time centimet give us centimet squar find volum need multipli area length base extend diagram tell us distanc centimet multipli centimet squar centimet get centimet rectangular prism volum cubic let tri find volum triangular prism first step calcul area base prism triangl formula find area triangl one half triangl base time height care confus base triangl base prism triangl diagram tell us base triangl inch es height inch es one half base time height would one half time time one half area triangl inch es squar find volum multipli area length extend told length inch es multipl inch es squar inch es get inch es volum readi tri find volum cylind cylind made extend circl first need calcul area circl learn previou video area circl found multipli pi time radiu squar radiu circl squar get squar multipli pi approxim get squar know area circl find volum cylind multipli area length circl extend happen time squar give us volum cylind cubic see find volum like made take shape extend along third axi find area shape multipli length extend give volum work work trapezoid pentagon diamond know accur calcul volum playtim way fun cours made extend shape along third dimens made rotat shape around axi sphere saw ear lier video instanc one way form sphere rotat circl around one diamet line sand anoth common shape form rotat shape around axi cone form rotat right triangl around one two perpendicular formula find volum sphere cone complic explain time learn arriv video best memor formula use test need toto find volum sphere use formula volum equal time pi time radiu cube dand find volum cone use formula volum equal one third time height time pi time radiu squar let tri one exampl wrap sphere radiu dimens need find volum formula say volum sphere equal x pi x radiu mean multipli time take c x c x c equal c multipli approxim pi time last multipli multipli divid give us volum centimet let tri cone use formula find volum cone need know two thing radiu circl form base cone heigh cone similar height triangl distanc point tip cone straight center circular base radiu base cone fee height first let plug radiu equat squar fee x fee fee squar next multipli pi get fee squar may notic area base circl need multipli base area one third time height time fee fee fee time squar fee give us cubic fee volum know lot volum know quantiti geometr object know measur volum cubic also learn calcul volum basic cours lot time cover video know common key put learn practic tri exercis problem alway thank watch math antic see ya next time learn math antic volum math antic volum math antic volum
