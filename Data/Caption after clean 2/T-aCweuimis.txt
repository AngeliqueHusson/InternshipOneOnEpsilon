ked parallel parallel slope theyr differ never ever intersect need look differ exact slope lucki us equal x plu b slope intercept form realli look figur slope slope line equal see right therefor line b slope equal two guy parallel ill graph second see final line c ill purpl slope equal dont know purpl dark line c line slope theyr differ differ theyr go parallel see let actual graph line intercept neg point slope move posit x direct go posit x go x go go go go go see line line go look someth like best draw straight possibl line better version line go look like well that good drew line let line b line b intercept neg neg intercept slope x goe go x goe goe x goe go go line go look someth like tri best connect dot sit steeper slope see x blue line increas direct line b notic intersect there definit two parallel line sand final let look line c intercept point slope increas x direct go goup direct decreas go godown direct increas well go go point go bunch point sand graph line let one time decreas two go go right neg neg still slope one time get right see line line look like look like notic line c line never intersect exact slope differ slope theyr increas exact rate theyr never go intersect line line c parallel
