video go go fli kite mean go introduc four side figur quadrilater two pair consecut side congruent yet opposit side congruent shape kite know go wind fun four side figur quadrilater wrap around go consecut wrap around quadrilater two side right arent congruent two tick mark one continu wrap around find pair pair pair two pair consecut side congruent add littl extra dont opposit side congruent well well would talk rhombu kite there lot basic structur kite sure book go introduc later kind give us one theorem start go exampl sand go bring kind quietli use text without dont think realli clarifi ing enough go us diagon kite go perpendicular diagon connect ing two vertic form noncongru side diagon go way diagon go perpendicular theyr go perpendicular there go bisect go diagon vertic includ noncongru side actual would diagon diagon vertic includ noncongru side diagon vertic includ congruent tri write math includ mean form diagon connect ing vertic form two side congruent diagon connect ing vertic form consecut congruent side that tri say go includ two column end video particular properti go proof also go coupl think three algebra exampl work side angl kite sin video last two column proof go prove two segment congruent first go get sorri interrupt ye diagon go get go prove later congruent also see though kind recal old concept theorem stuff rememb point point equidist anoth segment point perpendicular bisector go use properti leav mayb text book class yeah point that equidist anoth segment point perpendicular bisector opposit angl includ form noncongru side go congruent kite one diagon drawn though go proof ill quickli talk mean look diagon drawn would abl say short proof triangl triangl congruent due side side reflex properti third side two triangl congruent due two angl would correspond part congruent triangl congruent angl form noncongru side includ noncongru side alway go congruent kite diagon vertic includ congruent side form congruent side diagon go bisect opposit angl say angl congruent angl proof said two triangl congruent two angl go go congruent due correspond part mean use differ color two angl go congruent make diagon bisector angl reason two angl go congruent due correspond part congruent triangl congruent ye diagon connect goe angl form congruent go bisect opposit quit nice mean come good question work find measur miss angl miss side right go three exampl rememb three got kite kite coupl diagon want find measur mark valu inform give us cours kite one two pair congruent side angl right angl degre sand go use find measur angl well measur angl straightforward long rememb diagon kite intersect perpendicular fashion measur angl equal degre let turn attent let say angl look triangl triangl cours interior sum triangl equal degre within triangl got degre angl degre angl whatev left measur angl must make three angl insid triangl add measur angl go equal degre minu angl anoth minu take degre whatev left final answer minu go degre degre left take away first minu equal minu equal measur angl know measur angl degre know measur angl rememb angl form congruent pair angl congruent set side angl ad c angl diagon whatev measur angl measur angl measur angl also equal measur angl well dont work figur either rememb let see there coupl way approach think go remind two triangl rememb ing cours diagon intersect perpendicular fashion triangl ade triangl c de go right triangl right triangl theyr also congruent right triangl si prove triangl congruent triangl angl correspond angl angl mark degre measur angl also equal degre sand kind like verbal tal ked littl proof right reflex properti e congruent mean hypotenus leg two right triangl congruent correspond part congruent triangl congruent anoth littl tidbit exampl stress begin geometri especi use two column proof build logic cours give opportun reinforc memor theorem concept postul definit give still solv problem seven though write two column proof well got go kite look measur angl way think want look entir kite kite quadrilater right got four side know sum interior angl polygon equal number side minu time n four side four minu time degre four angl go add degre might angl angl two differ unknown cant make one equat solv right bat rememb angl congruent one tal ked previou window mean angl unknown valu think go let x angl angl measur kite go plu time x plu taken one two three four take four angl one two addit two make four want make sure add like term left hand side go add side undo addit weve got divid side x excus go divid side get x alon x equal degre want make sure right make sure plu plu equal degre good go go look agreement excel last exampl go look kite much complic scenario first give exact angl want solv forlet say well solv x actual could say solv x go actual know measur well abl solv problem well find measur miss well unknown valu swell angl form consecut noncongru go equal side side side show two triangl congruent correspond part congruent triangl congruent weve got equal minu go solv x go bring like avoid neg dont mind x right hand side equal add side get equal x equal go run room go paus video real go take valu go plug express actual fill time minu time degre sand plug back get degre well go eras go fill two angl inform theyr degre sand finish exampl last exampl kite kite origin name know told b congruent ad b c congruent actual could given inform draw diagram want prove diagon connect vertic congruent side includ bisect diagon also proof there proof book perpendicular bisector didnt want exact proof alreadi textbook see pretti simpl one want recal knowledg learn congruent triangl sand correspond part congruent triangl coupl time video alreadi well rein fore old concept well new talk two diagon perpendicular bisector perpendicular bisector theorem point equal distanc segment perpendicular bisector say perpendicular bisector c perpendicular bisector thu perpendicular bisector blah blah blah go state properti gave first thing said diagon perpendicular said diagon one that go prove fact diagon perpendicular go show b well go show prove e mid point congruent e go focu ing either side go focu two triangl ce triangl show two say ce band show two triangl go correspond part congruent triangl show two segment congruent proof go done kind verbal us go pretti quickli weve alreadi state b c congruent c say two blue triangl e c two triangl congruent go abl say two two right triangl go congruent due theorem coupl letter name abbrevi someth hypotenus someth someth let get reflex properti inform mark two triangl go congruent perpendicular angl go skip step say that specif degre angl that right angl right triangl due fact perpendicular kind proof littl bit show two right triangl congruent pair congruent leg pair congruent hypotenus soh said that congruent e correspond part congruent triangl sand know therefor congruent due mean taken segment b cut two equal part that simpli definit segment bisector that end proof r homework
