let ton make sure get trig function thing well let construct right construct right triangl sand want clear way defin far work right tri find trig function angl arent part right go see go construct right let focu right triangl let say triangl let say length seven let say length side say figur hypotenus go know let call hypotenus h know h squar go equal seven squar plu four squar know theorem hypotenus squar equal squar sum squar two squar equal seven squar plu four squar equal forti nine plu plu sixteen forti nine plu ten fifti nine plu six sixti five h squar let write h squar that differ shade h squar equal right forti nine plu ten fifti nine plu anoth six could say h equal take squar root side squar root squar root sixti five realli cant simplifi thing thirteen time five perfect squar theyr prime cant simplifi equal squar root sixti five let find trig let find trig function angl call angl theta whenev alway want write least work write soh toa vagu trigonometri teacher mayb read book dont know know type dian princess name soh toa whatev use appli soh find let say want find cosin want find cosin angl wan na find cosin angl say soh toa tell us cosin part tell cosin adjac hypotenus cosin equal adjac hypotenus let look theta side adjac well know hypotenus know hypotenus side cant side side that kind adjac hypotenus four adjac side side liter right next angl one side kind form angl four hypotenus hypotenus alreadi know squar root four squar root sometim peopl want ration denomin dont like irrat number denomin like squar root sixti five wan na rewrit without irrat number denomin multipli numer denomin squar root clearli chang number multipli someth multipli number one wont chang number least get rid irrat number denomin numer becom four time squar root denomin squar root time squar root go didnt get rid irrat number still numer let trig least core trig function swell learn futur there actual ton theyr deriv let think sine theta go soh soh tell sine sine opposit hypotenus sine equal opposit hypotenus sine opposit hypotenus angl side go opposit open opposit seven opposit side right opposit side hypotenus opposit hypotenus hypotenus squar root root wan ted ration could multipli time squar root squar root numer get seven squar root denomin get sixti five let tangent let us tangent ask tangent tangent theta go back soh toa part tell us tangent tell tell us tangent equal opposit adjac equal opposit opposit adjac angl opposit weve alreadi figur seven open seven opposit seven seven side adjac well four adjac four adjac adjac side four seven figur trig ratio theta let anoth anoth one ill make littl bit concret caus right weve say oh what tangent x tangent theta let make littl bit say let draw anoth right triangl that anoth right triangl everyth deal go right say hypotenus length say side length two let say length go two time squar root three verifi work side squar let write two time squar root three squar plu two squar equal two there go four time three four time three plu go equal twelv plu four equal sixteen sixteen inde four squar equal four equal four squar theorem rememb work might learn geometri might recogn triangl right right angl drawn get go show right triangl angl right thirti degre angl angl angl sixti degre angl thirti sixteen nineti side opposit thirti degre half hypotenus side opposit degre squar time side that hypotenus said gon na suppos review triangl although actual find trig ratio differ ask anyon ask sine thirti degre sand rememb degre one angl triangl would appli whenev degre angl deal right triangl well definit futur say sine thirti angl right thirti degre use right triangl rememb soh rewrit soh toa sine tell us correct soh tell us sine sine opposit hypotenus sine thirti degre opposit side opposit side two hypotenus hypotenus two fourth thing thirti degre see alway go equal cosin cosin thirti go back soh tell us cosin cosin adjac hypotenus look thirti degre angl adjac right adjac right next hypotenus adjac hypotenus two squar root three adjac hypotenus four simplifi divid numer denomin two squar root three two final let tangent tangent thirti go back soh toa soh toatoa tell us tangent opposit adjac go degre angl that care tangent thirti opposit two opposit two adjac two squar root three right next adjac adjac mean next two squar root three equal two cancel one squar root three could multipli numer denomin squar root three squar root three squar root three go equal numer squar root three denomin right go three weve ration squar root three three fair enough let use triangl figur trig ratio sixti weve alreadi drawn sine sixti degre sand think hope get han g sine opposit adjac soh soh toa sixti degre angl side opposit open two squar root three opposit side two squar root three sixti degre angl sorri opposit hypotenus dont want confus opposit hypotenus two squar root three four four hypotenus equal squar root three two cosin sixti degre cosin sixti rememb soh toa cosin adjac hypotenus adjac two side right next sixti degre angl two hypotenus four equal final tangent tangent sixti degre swell tangent soh toa tangent opposit adjac opposit sixti degre si two squar root three two squar root three adjac adjac two adjac sixti degre two opposit adjac two squar root three two equal squar root three wan ted look relat sine thirti degre cosin sixti cosin degre thing sine degre sand guy invers think think littl bit triangl start make sens well keep extend give lot practic next video
