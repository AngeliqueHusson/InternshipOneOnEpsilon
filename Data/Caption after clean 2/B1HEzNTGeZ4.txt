hi rob welcom math antic sin lesson gon na learn three import math concept mean median mode math often deal data set data set often collect group may result scientif measur survey data collect exampl might record age member famili data might measur weight pet list data data set fairli small easi understand could much bigger data set sa realli big data set might contain cost everi item store top speed everi land mammal bright galaxi data set would contain lot differ number sand look big data set one would pretti hard make sens say much besid well lot mean median mode realli help us three differ data give us use easi understand inform data set see big pictur understand data mean world live pretti use huh let learn properti realli find calcul particular data set let start mean may ever hear someth cal led mean l l bet v e hear averag v e got good news mean mean averag mean averag two differ term exact properti data mean averag extrem use properti understand let look simpl data set contain visual aid let also repres stack height correspond eight three two six right sinc differ stack block differ rearrang block goal make stack word stack could exact amount would amount well bit trial error l l see enough block stack total mean mean averag origin data set would greater less amount could made would becom concept mean valu get could smooth flatten differ data valu one consist valu way use math calcul mean data set would inconveni alway use stack block got easier learn mathemat procedur calcul mean let start block time instead trial use systemat way make stack height way involv clever combin addit divis know want end stack number block right first let add like block one big count block show us total divid number stack equal stack total equal stack mean l l sinc divid equal math procedur use find mean data two simpl add set divid total get mani ad answer get mean data set let use procedur find mean age member fine look famili add calcul hand like total age need divid total number age ad divid mean age member famili alright mean median middl data number split data set two equal size group halv one half contain member greater equal median half contain member less equal median sometim find median data set easi sometim hard find middl valu data member order least vice data set lot number sit might take lot work put right order alreadi make thing easier let start realli basic data set n order pretti easi see put data set order least valu switch data set find median middl data set easi exactli middl almost seem easi n get harder tri harder problem want point sometim mean median data set number sometim case simpl data set median mean also see rearrang follow procedur learn calcul mean first data set found mean determin mean data set median well median middl sinc data set alreadi order least easi see middl sinc split member two equal data set mean median find median set need make sure order identifi member exactli middl make sure equal number member either side tokay far good may wonder data set n obviou middl member set v e found median far odd number even number data set n member middl split set two equal size case actual use learn mean help us data set even number member find median need take middl two calcul mean averag two basic number would exactli half way two middl number sand number median exampl set need take middl two find mean divid plu equal divid median data set though number n actual member data median repres middl data set split member two equal size know differ mean median mode data set world mean well mode technic word valu data set occur often data set v e seen even mode none data valu ever repeat data set member valu repeat rearrang see one two three mode data set valu occur often frequent would sinc three snow get confus number repeat time mode number repeat often mani time repeat member data set occur also possibl data set one mode exampl data set like set number repeat twice number mean tie titl mode set two mode know mean median mode data set put new inform use one final real world exampl suppos guy make sell custom electr tabl show mani guitar sold month find mean median mode data set first find mean need add number guitar sold month addit hand use calcul want way care sinc lot add want make mistak answer get total sold whole year get mean sold month need divid total number month divid mean averag find median data set go rearrang data point order figur middl valu better sinc even number member set choos middl number go pick middl two find mean middl sinc equal number data valu either side need take mean easi plu equal divid median number guitar sold mean half month sold half month sold less let identifi mode data set let two data three look like frequent number mode data result occur red often alright basic mean median mode three realli use data set know find sometim part mean median mode rememb ing rememb mean mean averag median middl mode start remind number occur often rememb get good math need watch video need practic sure tri find mean median mode alway thank watch math antic l l see ya next time learn
