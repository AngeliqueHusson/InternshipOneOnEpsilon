hey go video work find sign differ train metric wonder neat littl tool pick school alright may seen mayb actual great way easili memor whether someth like sine cosin posit neg that mean sign let learn real quick see exactli inform us differ trigonometr function like sine get number idea thing go posit neg clue realli figur well posit neg depend angl end quadrant one quadrant two quadrant three quadrant four know quadrant go easili figur sine go tell trigger trigonometr function go posit neg exampl angl end first quadrant trigonometr function go posit deal sine degre sure enough that first quadrant oh know that go posit valu get quadrant number two know sine reciproc go posit rest tangent cosin neg tell valu trigonometr function go posit sine reciproc know well go ahead write cosec also posit one right move whose go posit third quadrant well dont one trigonometr function start that tangent want cotang one tangent reciproc last one get posit cosin reciproc know function swill posit quadrant rememb realli quickli well great mnemon student take calculu mark order quadrant quadrant one quadrant two student quadrant three take quadrant four calculu student take calculu know turn associ take one step actual tri exampl wonder littl thing gon na draw corner someth take quick test someth know quickli sketch student take calculu well use help us figur what go goal problem figur quadrant angl end thing know littl bit sine function know plug angl sine neg plug angl tangent turn posit angl go well know sine neg immedi rule first second quadrant first posit second quadrant sine posit specif know neg got lower half shade far somewher next bit inform tangent posit let see tangent posit well posit first quadrant that posit third quadrant two could could there one quadrant thing happen sure enough quadrant number three quadrant angl quadrant three inform littl hint angl let time cosin neg cosec posit c cosin neg rule two need neg know side cosin neg cosec greater zero tobe care stand sine tangent cosin wors cosec ko see also rememb appli cosec reciproc sine cosec angl equal word sine angl gon na use sign sine angl sine posit sine posit upper half let shade upper half right like there one place condit happen simultan know angl theta quadrant number two know dont afraid write piec paper quick refer realli lot intuit sign trigonometr right youd like see video pleas
