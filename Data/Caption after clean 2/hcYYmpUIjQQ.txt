welcom anoth episod fort bend mathemat tutor ing take moment sooth cant hurt nobodi hello ladi gentleman fort bend tutor ing multipli right two term time two term sand exampl format basic time two set parenthes two within use two differ strategi es order solv one use favorit distribut properti mean got arrow that arrow would end multipli first term time second set parenthes would multipli second term also term second set parenthes therefor would end upwith follow product would end time c plu time plu b time c plu b time that simpli term first set parenthes time everyth second set parenthes prefer howev simplifi process way defin follow say could multipli first term togeth mean c term multipli outer term togeth mean time multipli inner term b time cand final last term set parenthes mean b time aka foil method prefer simpli distribut properti foil method someth extra learn thing that right distribut properti multipli time c time b time c b time exact thing foil method ladi student pleas understand aswel learn foil method dont want learn f oh l stand simpli multipli everyth fine fine right let show first problem problem number one quantiti x minu time x plu go first foremost get arrow right know ill multipli x time term second set parenthes well take neg multipli time term well ill end upwith follow result x time x x squar x time notic circl neg second term first set parenthes neg keep right well neg time give neg final neg time neg love foil method exact thing multipli first term togeth mean x time x multipli outer term mean x time multipli inner term neg x final multipli second term set parenthes neg get neg keep mind look search term term sare alway separ plu first set parenthes first term x second term neg second set parenthes first term x term posit finish alway look see combin like term notic middl term neg x first power mean make let add togeth ill bring x squar minu give posit final id bring posit done that got gon na put are box around answer that like alway that process multipli binomi right like right know think want switch let pull one right go p roud number two follow x minu time plu gon na start get arrow gon na circl second term neg wont forget final ill start multipli time give time next ill neg time give neg x neg neg finish multipli answer descend order x mean gon na start term highest expon work way ever concern order put term alway write answer descend order variabl less right let bring squar ill combin middl term togeth mean neg x give neg x ill bring neg that answer gon na put red box around got let keep go right next problem quantiti x minu time minu gon na give arrow that right get arrow pop ladi gentl men reim gon na multipli x time squar x time neg neg next neg time x neg x also neg neg rememb neg time neg posit ill end posit last term rememb next thing combin like term that right look term ad togeth middl term neg neg combin ill squar see like sign add alright keep sign biggest term bring neg sign unlik scienc attract alway keep sound ill posit right that answer let put box around problem number minu plu ill ill right get arrow gon na second term neg right wont alway neg time second term neg sign prefer remind neg circl around right time squar next time multipli time give neg time neg notic distribut combin like term may two middl term like term also addit invers mean theyr one tri equal zero twelv eighti cancel right theyr gone end squar minu type binomi minu cal led differ squar differ two ever want figur factor word get back origin alright minu time plu go ahead check video differ squar ladi gentl men alright multipli one factor ing need lesson check alright ill put descript box alright good deal that problem number right next check alright problem number quantiti squar time one term insid set parenthes expon outsid repeat distribut expon insid parenthes cant mathemat correct instead mean binomi minu three rais second power mean time minu that right quantiti minu second power mean multipli must expand word first step binomi squar expand look like previou problem deal multipli binomi time binomi mean appli distribut properti foil gon na get got get let go ahead multipli time give squar time neg neg neg neg final neg time neg give posit right time finish alway look see combin term exact variabl exact expon variabl right bring squar right ill end neg posit done right say dont like ill fix right dont know better right therefor better four squar minu twelv plu nine result that alright let go ahead put box around next let look around number six problem number six anoth binomi squar binomi go expand multipli plu time yea plu that gon na first step see problem distribut expon insid parenthesi right proper way go go ahead multipli everyth get let forget get arrow final second term posit right time give time x notic variabl alphabet order alway identifi like term ill time give x final time gon na give posit squar done go attempt combin like term may identifi like term term exact exact expon son variabl that exactli middl term combin ill squar togeth posit x final posit squar last term answer that alright check next problem right problem number seven quantiti minu time ill gon na start get second term neg well make sure know second term neg start gon na multipli give squar time give posit x multipli neg time give neg final neg time give neg squar alright next gon na combin middl term gon na write answer descend order x start term highest expon x variabl first term squar combin x minu end posit x ill neg that gon na answer that done done prime number seven like last problem ladi problem number problem number plu time x minu c see happen problem right got go distribut term second set parenthes multipli squar time x end x cube rememb expon like base add x squar x first power plu give x third power variabl ill multipli x squar time neg z give squar z notic write variabl alphabet order that know rest right gon na multipli three z give posit x z right purpos write variabl alphabet order help identifi like term finish multipli pleas everi time well multipli time neg z neg distribut alway look see like four gentl men notic everi term differ combin variabl dont ident variabl exact variabl theyr differ first term x cube second term x squar z third term x z last term z squar none four term like term answer wont abl add combin alright final result well ladi fort bend tutor ing multipli binomi alway pleas comment rate subscrib ladi gentl men pleas donat help us bring alright take care certainli hope today mathemat present learn anyth need review take deep breath congratul learn mathemat
