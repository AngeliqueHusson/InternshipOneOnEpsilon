alright anoth exampl sort know tri figur trig function could use be test describ given graph assum thing suppos neg pi pi pi sort gener shape well look lot like graph regular oh let see either tangent cotang believ lot like plain old cotang x rememb cotang pi pi piso neg piet c rememb cotang normal kind place sort actual call would cal led known inflect point kind sort bend upward sort sort like know sort chang indirect bend graph right normal happen zero pi sort sort chang way graph bend alright problem there equal cotang x reason sort point new graph similar plain old cotang x notic sort point way bend inflect point cal led notic happen sat neg two look like origin look like graph cotang would like take graph move two well move graph shift graph vertic either add subtract number either want move subtract number want move case want move graph two simpli like origin graph equal cotang x subtract two simpli move graph would say probabl know rough sketch would say probabl exactli equat would describ graph n need coeffici x n chang sort horizont shift n toto add subtract anyth x insid parenthes get noth bad kind hey look like origin cotang move littl bit find formula trigonometr graph ex find formula trigonometr graph ex find formula trigonometr graph ex
