right go today look factor polynomi four term go want attempt group first that easiest procedur right howev factor group alway work right doesnt right suggest would use ration root theorem allow make factor ing lot easier use ration root theorem use gener list possibl root appli synthet divis right that go break hope trinomi go abl continu factor polynomi express four term might attempt factor group see x squar would come term two would come term get match insid term factor group go work right case go appli ration root ration root theorem say take end constant let p take lead integ coeffici case let q abl gener possibl root equat plu minu p q right go stick q start know know mayb coeffici possibl root goe quickli make problem difficult alright p q go give us factor go need look factor would plu minu plu minu plu minu find one actual turn root zero function go appli synthet divis go randomli pick one right let tri mayb say neg one let tri see work neg one want see go root go put neg one littl box formi synthet divis go take coeffici write gon na recal divis one go come straight multipli time neg alway add go neg time neg plu neg time neg neg plu neg look though got lucki one right long get remaind know found root that look remaind number would work would tri posit would gotten remaind tri posit keep tri one factor come upwith remaind right tell neg root neg root factor polynomi express would x plu k root come upwith factor x plu come rest express go get synthet divis recal plain constant term x squar next third forth downlin rest x squar plu plu right origin four term polynomi simpler express x plu x squar plu plu need go go bring standard trinomi get lucki go factor right let see think guy guess check type trinomi go take fact there would either go use get middl term posit that go make posit that go make posit complet longer factor origin polynomi express
