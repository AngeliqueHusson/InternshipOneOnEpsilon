hi name maria mathematician today go show solv linear equat variabl side equat minu equal plu first thing want get variabl one side easiest thing avoid neg possibl get rid smaller coeffici go get rid posit would get rid accord invers oper would subtract x minu x cancel subtract side equat subtract side equat know subtract like term subtract minu cancel neg realli import alway rememb bring sign come call leash bring equal sign minu equal bring plu one side follow step solv equat use alway rememb get rid addit subtract go minu side get minu neg equal cancel last step divid side dim go get x equal neg go dont want chang mix number would name maria solv linear equat swith variabl side
