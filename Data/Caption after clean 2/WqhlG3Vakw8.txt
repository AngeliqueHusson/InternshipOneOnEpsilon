hi rob welcom math antic lesson gon na learn theorem theorem sometim may wonder theorem world well math theorem simpli statement proven true thing either known accept true well realli smart dude live long time ago ancient prove theorem applaus historian complet sure actual prove could one student usual get credit applaus anyway main thing need know theorem describ import geometr relationship three side right triangl gon na learn relationship minut first sever thing need know truli understand theorem use solv understand theorem need know angl triangl also need know littl bit expon squar topic new sure watch video second even though theorem geometri need know basic algebra actual use specif need know variabl sand solv basic algebra equat involv cover lot topic first five video algebra basic got background cover let see theorem actual theorem state sever differ way one like best goe like right triangl leg b hypotenus c squar plu b squar equal c squar see definit theorem appli triangl sit right know right triangl alway includ one right angl usual mark squar help identifi need know angl right angl help identifi import side triangl cal led hypotenus hypotenus long st side right triangl alway side opposit right angl word side n touch help form right angl order use theorem need abl identifi hypotenus variabl c stand theorem c length hypotenus side two side triangl touch form right angl cal led leg theorem definit variabl b repres matter leg cal led leg cal led b long keep track make initi know variou part theorem let think relationship equat squar plu b squar equal c squar realli tell tell us take length two leg side b squar mean multipli squar time b squar b time b add two squar amount togeth equal amount get squar hypotenus side would c squar c time c may sound littl first let take look special exampl right triangl help theorem make littl sens right triangl cal led triangl side rel length rel length mean length realli matter side could express inch es triangl could size long proport rel start side long call side get squar side well arithmet squar mean multipli time equal geometr equival squar someth actual result squar shape see squar contain unit red area repres valu squar theorem next let look side long call side b squar mean multipli time geometr equival liter squar side cover total area blue area repres b squar theorem final let deal hypotenus side c long st side long squar mean multipli time geometr equival squar area green area repres c squar theorem see arithmet part theorem relat geometr part right triangl let check see theorem realli true least special case arithmet side add amount squar b squar realli equal c squar littl rear rang unit squar see area squar form two equal area squar form hypotenus wow ancient realli smart know cool n even care theorem good well alway good question answer like mani thing math theorem use tool help use know figur know specif right triangl know long two side theorem tell figur length third unknown side exampl imagin right triangl c long side c long side know long hypotenus problem theorem tell us relationship three side right triangl figur know squar plu b squar equal c squar let plug know equat solv know matter two leg cal led b let label like substitut b theorem equat give us algebra equat one unknown c solv equat c word rearrang equat c one side equal sign know exactli c know length side triangl first need simplifi left side equat sinc contain known number sand accord order oper need simplifi expon first squar squar add result equat c squar c squar get c need invers done sinc squar invers oper squar root need take squar root side take squar root c squar give us c want side equat give us littl problem side easi figur squar root perfect squar go decim probabl irrat number fine leav answer squar root sure could use calcul get decim valu realli need one math common leav squar root alon unless easi simplifi side right triangl c c squar root tri anoth exampl right triangl know length hypotenus one leg length leg unknown let use theorem find unknown length usual call hypotenus side c let call leg know side leg know side b substitut known valu theorem solv unknown c give us equat squar plu b squar equal squar need simplifi solv b first let simplifi expon squar squar need isol b squar subtract ing side equat side leav us b squar side minu solv simplifi equat b take squar root side give us b equal squar root fine leav answer squar root like may know squar root simplifi time squar root go worri simplifi ing root video know awesom know leav answer squar root anoth interest one unit squar cut half along diagon side squar unit long far one corner squar along diagon well sinc diagon squar two right triangl use theorem tell us unknown distanc label leg right triangl b hypotenus c sinc know b plug theorem equat give us us squar plu squar equal c squar solv c squar left side equat plu mean c squar equal take squar root side get c equal squar root far across diagon unit use theorem find length unknown side right triangl common use anoth way use theorem want mention also use theorem test triangl see truli right triangl ya case alreadi sure exampl someon show triangl ask right triangl well look lot like right triangl right angl symbol would hard tell angl exactli degre look mayb realli close like theorem tell us sure know length three side triangl know length b c plug theorem equat see hold true particular case sinc two shorter side c long st side c plug valu b c simplifi see get squar side equat get plu side squar look right equat simplifi equal definit true statement mean three side triangl work fit relationship squar plu b squar equal c sinc theorem tell us right triangl fit relationship triangl must right know theorem know use use find miss side right triangl also use test triangl see right triangl see take lot math skill abl use theorem effect may need brush skill readi tri rememb get good math watch video actual need practic real math alway thank watch math antic see ya next time learn math antic theorem math antic theorem math antic theorem
