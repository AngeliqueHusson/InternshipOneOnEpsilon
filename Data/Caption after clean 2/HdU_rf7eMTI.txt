hi welcom math antic sin video cal led long divis learn divis problem long key break big divis problem seri smaller easier divis step sand involv tri divid dividend one digit exampl saw go pretti easi one digit need use divis method problem bigger divisor divid two three digit number lesson gon na learn handl problem like good news kind alreadi know may realiz yet see mean look two divis problem dividend one digit divisor divisor differ see go effect divis process solv first problem start mani take make almost think mani fit easi see answer put first digit answer multipli time subtract leav us remaind move next digit need bring copi combin remaind first digit ask mani make easi put next digit minu leav remaind final last digit even though remaind bring copi ask mani make answer exactli leav remaind went broke problem three divis step one digit got answer let solv next exampl right start see bit problem ask mani take make almost answer none first digit taken less big divid well instead tri divid first digit let group first two togeth group togeth first step ask mani make divid time put answer line right go skip first digit group wan ted could put zero first digit sinc divid time help keep track answer digit good idea minu give us remaind one digit left divid bring copi combin remaind ask mani make know answer leav remaind answer notic differ two problem wan ted go problem second problem divisor bigger first digit dividend start go time case help us see someth realli import tradit long divis method alway go one digit time break dividend bigger want appli procedur bigger could go two three time even tri divid entir dividend one step take bigger divid usual result divis three step first problem two step second step like sound seem like lot less work ah divis step sound better realli group togeth harder divis step thought good true kind like climb lot small step one easi climb big step one challeng alway tri go one digit time divid one two dividend time much easier answer smaller divis step found multipl tabl memor right go time lot harder figur answer relat two digit divisor see two digit divisor forc us take bigger step see mean let tri two new divis problem dividend two new divisor two digit divisor sin first problem could start mani fit sinc divisor two alreadi know one digit chunk dividend big enough divid two digit divisor automat need group first two ask mani make multipl multipl tabl instead figur good guess know time would realli good estim first digit time subtract get remaind far alreadi dealt first two dividend bring last digit join remaind ask mani make easi saw time leav remaind answer first two digit divisor problem let look next problem also got two digit divisor start way start two digit chunk dividend ask mani take make almost u h oh problem even though two work alreadi greater mean go take even bigger chunk dividend need group first three togeth like whole problem without break step divis problem big divisor get difficult two three digit divisor step might big whole long divis problem take lot trial error figur fact way math antic divis problem get complic let student use calcul solv want calcul want whenev long divis two digit divisor get way need solv problem without calcul best strategi well littl help us make much better guess es answer kind hard work made estim chang would make easier estim answer sinc would divid exactli time mean divid least mani time let make first estim answer check see good estim multipli subtract see remaind tricki may want use scratch paper work time subtract get remaind look like estim low whenev remaind greater equal divisor mean underestim answer fact sinc remaind equal divisor mean could divid exactli one pick multipli time see see even though divis procedur basic case valu divisor make big differ divis divisor bigger part dividend tri divid mean need group take bigger divis tri one much longer two digit divisor divid gon na work fast may want watch coupl time troubl follow sinc two digit divisor start first dividend ask mani take make gon na use round help us estim close realli close sinc time estim first answer digit minu leav remaind know estim right less divisor move next digit bring copi combin ask mani take make one easier estim easi see two would minu leav remaind next bring copi ask mani take make bit estim round know five make estim next answer minu leav remaind bring copi next digit ask mani take make u h oh big enough divid worri alreadi know tri divid bigger number smaller number put zero answer line move next digit bring copi combin remaind ask mani take make estim one go round sinc put answer line minu leav remaind done wow lot work see much round us made good estim time round work know long divis procedur work two digit divisor sit divis step involv two three dividend sinc bigger step harder figur want use help find answer sand good know complex divis problem like still think complex divis problem job calcul tri practic problem wear realli long divis like reason studi math becom good problem solver abl understand sort import math lot math divis alway thank watch math antic see ya next
