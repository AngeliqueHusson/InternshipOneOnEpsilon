welcome cute little puzzle geometry student circle theorem imagine archaeologist something like youve discovered section rim awheel youd like know basically size came student give story like give piece paper picture arc circle ask size circle whence came let clear tool use work guess ruler measure straight length actually measure length thing guess pencil draw thing give protractor actually measure angle question size whoops circle arc came theres little bit vague word sigh mean people interpret literally big circle radius approach problem think center circle find rate line center arc trick find center circle answer yes fact think couple ways ill go another interpretation size could looser maybe know fraction full degree amount turning angular measure arc question real puzzle way work ark represent whats measure arc without finding center first ruler pencil protractor theres way right first let give couple ways could think technique finding center first use basic geometry circle geometry let whip right one standard fact ever draw cord circle find mid point ruler theres mid point used tractor could draw degree mid point basically got perpendicular bisector record basic circle particular bias cord actually goes center circle mean different quarter drawn find perpendicular bisector go center intersect center circle yes one source enter circle get rule measure radius going anywhere awkward whats radii get amy protractor actually measure angle turning ask question fully completely clever clever student really piece paper rather piece paper arc might realize dont need tool actually find center sneaky following take picture arc piece paper holdup light light choose section arc measure folding paper section arc end lying top rest arc crease line something like hard get everything away crease mark actually line thats perpendicular tangent line circle another theorem basic circle perpendicular tangent go center display literally fall paper take another section capital light fold paper way land son ark make crease mark like go center circle tool rule pencil found center circle tool measure radio measure angle turning got whole answer question right id like address puzzle find angle turning ark represent without going analysis finding center first puzzle answer yes nice application circle geometry want try figure first good time pause screen dim ready give away answer goes find find measure arc theres angular motion arc without working center right draw cord end anywhere else draw matching call end protractor measure angle x fine know x basically done use resort geometry effects classic resort circle geometry ever two cord arc thats fancy language seen two call like inscribe dangle thats call k id hereto call peripheral angle theres basic fact peripheral angle describe angle always half measure arc wonderful fact circle surprising theres reason believe angle always thing arc measure goes going imagine rest circle see right away arc green cord make angle case circle got double measure say arc interested degree must minus x turns get ruler ill draw two cord like find hundred degree know know right away arch measure minus daggers thats swift thats beautiful muscle application result actually put practice dont go outside find section flowerpot something sip ping work measure arc lot
