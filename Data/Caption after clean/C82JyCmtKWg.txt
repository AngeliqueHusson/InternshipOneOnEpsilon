deterministic computer produce genuinely random even need music computer need access random used encrypt information deal card game virtual solitaire simulate unknown variable like weather prediction airplane much random computer deterministic meaning action determined prescribe set instruction show possibly produce random number well knut h put art sense random number example random number rather speak sequence independent random number swith distribution simulate role die create sequence random x x x chance number distribution deterministic computer computer generate truly random type external input process assume random inherit randomness world random number generator typically measure random physical extra piece hardware like counter tabulate background radiation short period time sequence random radiation type number generator shave major one require extra hardware also fast take gather external data random number generation reproducible testing program want repeatedly use set random distinguish feature randomness feature program n easy randomness derive physical phenomenon fortunately time n need produce actually random need seem random pseudo random enter pseudo random like sequence genuinely random number sand many statistical associated random actually produced deterministic process follow set rule pattern example v algorithm start number cal led seedlet say four digit number like algorithm name suggest square extract middle four next term sequence repeat process n define x sub n plus middle x sub n squared square less eight pad leading eight extract middle four starting four digit seed middle square sequence random looking definitely way create random looking sequence current gold standard pseudo random twister based much simpler linear congruential start linear congruential generator four input modulus multiplier increment c seed sequence starting value run example equal equal c equal seed multiply seed add c take whole thing min word look remainder divided min example give get rest sequence x sub n plus equal times x sub n plus c resulting sequence minus option randomish sequence decide whether use genuine random number generator one two pseudo random middle square method linear congruential algorithm remember one downfall generating truly random measuring physical phenomenon example counter reproduce sequence make difficult test program pseudo random number seed single number entire sequence want test program identical sequence random n need store entire sequence need know seed huge benefit pseudo random number generator shave random number sequence easily also n require special device theyre efficient obvious disadvantage pseudo random random appear less random sequence middle square algorithm range sequence linear congruential generator range one look random first mean sequence random well one way determine sequence random instead many different statistical randomness example could compute running average mean could plot histogram example something would make sequence seem less random pattern kept showing upwell sequence pseudo random repeat word sequence number term sequence repeat sis cal led period example generating impossible go term sequence without number soon number start cycling pseudo random number rule essentially formula number sequence determined previous number sequence repeat quickly example sequence v middle square term next number back keep cycle period four term ever show sequence becomes cycle period pseudo random sequence middle square algorithm always cycle period smaller seen period much sequence linear congruential generator also repeat select good value modulus multiplier c increment period n want pick big value like kind big general linear congruential generator run much longer middle square algorithm one feature make number generator finally want mention distribution far loo ked method produce random simulate pseudo random fixed value like word distribution uniform integer much useful sequence number swith uniform distribution interval mean given term sequence equally likely actually since computer certain amount decimal precision let say simplified example first four decimal matter uniform distribution uniform distribution form x x easy obtain divide sequence integer useful sequence number swith uniform distribution generate sequence random distribution something known inverse transform sampling let say want generate sequence random number swith normal distribution centimeter standard deviation represent height woman may seen picture probability density function roughly tell likely randomly selected woman height function highest around since likely height really tiny since unlikely someone tall comparison probability density function uniform distribution flat since point equally likely let talk cumulative tell likely randomly select something value uniform distribution pretty easy randomly selected point chance smaller chance smaller chance smaller cumulative distribution function height value function point probability randomly selected woman shorter x let say want sequence represent height bunch word want generate distribution fortunately thanks inverse transform sampling uniform sequence first number sequence locate point cumulative distribution height whose value word find height shorter next number sequence use cumulative distribution locate height shorter new sequence let check make sense intuitively around height cumulative distribution quickly steep slope correspond high probability shallow slope low probability uniformly randomly select point determine point x axis function value point correspond place steep slope high probability less correspond place shallow slope low probability somewhat amazingly method transform sequence uniform pseudo random sequence different distribution even deterministic computer truly random pseudo random technique explore give uniform distribution turn give us sequence swith distribution like height wind speed dice next time infinite lots great response second video cop robber vane gas ked case infinitely branching tree would one branch infinitely many case would robber bechase infinitely long branch great question case tree talking episode none infinitely long length length length none infinitely long become arbitrarily long kind weird distinction infinitely many branch es though tree talking cop wind tree finite branch robber eventually get caught infinitely long branch tree would become robber wind robber could keep going along infinitely long branch great question ked guy two question sat end challenge ked cop number lazy cop number two graph sand lot great response lot great proof sa lot really different cool winner answer graph look like star cal led peter sen graph cop number lazy cop number three case graph look like three three grid cop number two lazy cop number three proof many pointed cop number less equal lazy cop number great insight right see next time generate pseudo random infinite series generate pseudo random infinite series generate pseudo random infinite series
