cones pyramid similar shape similar formula finding surface area whenever possible like together make easier memorize think find easier let look formula surface area course outer surface object surface see area base capital b mean area bottom base case going square could triangular pyramid type pyramid area base cone going circle find area base formula particular shape gon na one half perimeter base times l slant height slant like leaning height like angle height dont want overall height use calculate volume leaning slant height one one pyramid dont want use edge cal led lateral edge want actually height triangle would height right done pyramid first example basically peeled like banana right back laid flat call net youve got square bottom wan ted could find area square area one four add everything together got formula doesnt little bit efficient way ill show works area let write formula going b plus p l base square times plus perimeter base thats distance way around thats going times see slant height leaning height case k like leaning leaning tower k times plus k area covering little cylinder sorry cone little bit different go ahead draw circular base little bit tricky know draw theres lateral area unfold doesnt fold flat like pyramid kind know guess would look like hard really know unfold still formula though area base p l let break circle whats formula area circle pi r squared right going pi times squared k cos radius perimeter base perimeter base another way saying circumference whats formula circumference well pi r could say pi times diameter notice cancel half left pi times r times l book see cones pir square plus pi r l written way memorize k area base plus p l weve got pi times radius slant height angled height simplify get times pi plus times pi add together get pi square
