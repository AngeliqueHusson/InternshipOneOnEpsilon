absolutely see hurt head undergraduate second year undergraduate professor physics head yeah tricky concept one symbol thats important symbol j represent part complex number special significance j minus already extraordinary kind object something hundred year mathematics idea find square root negative number call naturally imaginary number well yeah explain conundrum square root negative number take square get take square get negative number snow minus squared unfortunately plus minus squared unfortunately plus cant get negative side axis square use j know call call j e would call square root something like current density difficulty weve got sort letter used multiple sense actually make quite difficult example get get head around concept keep chopping long time ago symbol iota think people always associated iota either something small something abstract indeed used many jay become preferred symbol certainly set wont get many sort go dark side start j example thats question culture youve built grow guess thing become might start little bit cohesion term usage symbol j rotation thing go round oscillate kind sinusoidal smooth way j particular significance call complex plane get head around know get head around idea imaginary number truth device mathematical convenience way help us use equation get mathematically represent mathematically ai example observe observable quantity physically observable quantity output input real measurable like displacement force voltage something measure inside middle mathematical process use cant measure could never measure imaginary quantity yet help us make right prediction comes term really really important console really important number see look people like understand bit imagine look people like perfectly well imagine look sand distinctly remember concept imaginary number superb fact discount idea ever use j grounds conceal structure could explain another mean way complex number sand mathematical linked physics physical world mean yes although express mathematically certainly head completely around actual fact proven value engineering taught undergraduate course probably engineering course first dynamics
