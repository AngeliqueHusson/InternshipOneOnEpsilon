want video prove opposite angle parallelogram congruent example want prove cab congruent angle equal angle angle congruent ca angle realize parallel line sand transversal sand parallel switch let continue look little bit like transversal intersect ing parallel line sand really could pause try prove really comes alternate interior angle corresponding transversal intersect ing parallel let say angle right new color since already used let start right angle going mark angle right alternate interior angle angle right actually could extend point could call point e want could say angle congruent alternate interior transversal two ae parallel enough kind change thinking little bit instead view b c parallel line sand view b transversal see angle going congruent angle bac corresponding angle going congruent angle could say cab corresponding angle sand angle congruent angle angle congruent angle congruent angle let make sure get right could say congruent angle cab weve proven first part right prove two congruent use exact logic first view transversal view c transversal b c dand let go let create another point call point f right know angle going congruent angle fa c alternate interior angle sand change thinking little bit view c b parallel line sand b transversal angle fa c going congruent angle theyre corresponding f angle corresponding first time vie wed transversal transversal b c parallel line snow b transversal b c parallel line sand obviously congruent congruent two congruent see opposite angle congruent parallelogram opposite angle going congruent
