let get wild crazy box es machine ill stick box es going left let keep simple way box es right going mighty fine well mess top though weve done two one three one ten machine sand ex mo get kind crazy number sa machine first question machine interesting yes thats subjective question might interesting peer tome might something someone else first happen well dot jump one explode becomes one dot explore becomes explode dot fact shoot infinity actually seem pretty wild untamed well shoot infinity much else ah let stop messing simply one machine well made machine one work well put explode becomes exploit become true become become infinity time like expanding shoot infinity pretty wild sure sure much say k fine right let mess around suppose say aha three dot explode little let try gon na go back beginning put one dot jump dot put second dot zoom nothing happen need explore stays dot third dot zoom explode ka boom become two dot one place left code nothing think think nothing two dot zero right thats always white mouse box jump jump feeling gon na particularly exciting comes cabal dot dot kazoo ball dot dot alright ill go back code strange dont know idea idea alright maybe way get code go back start race weve got put dot right lots three exploit ka boom two three explode become two three explode become two exploit come yet golly gee right one dot left bunch dot three explode come become become two guess leaves two dot pretty smudgy sorry still got three dot explode ka boom ball dot dot thats two one two one two one two one code messy two one two one wow let write neatly apparently two one two right fun working code different real question course brain right machine actually oh kind base arithmetic like something brand new whats actually happening alright gon na try figure let clear machine game every game play far dot always worth one know worth know three explode make three dot equivalent two dot wonder could figure dot place well dont know bet going let write write w dont know going know two two dot three dot oh little piece three let divide sides get must worth three halves one half right three halves let keep going know go next spot three dot three three halves equivalent two dot right whats dot um well wont ill use b dont know going right know two vote three three let divide sides two see v aught three halves squared thats fourth going three halves squared nine fourth bet prediction value one let call w b let call z space country know three three three halves squared three sorry z halves squared little bit messy smudgy two three three halves squared divide side see z indeed three halves cube thats twenty seven eighth well bingo working something equivalent base three halves space one half sense bet next one indeed three halves fourth power wow um baby little bit careful calling base one half object coefficient got two two actually bigger base bit weird sense really working three one half say version base right look say great weve seen space one sense gon na careful space one half know actually dont believe mean even though intellectual youve done dont understand really throw let think think thats whole right whole number right nose whole number yet apparently composed say take guy twenty seven eighth sand one one two three halves one one horrible fraction theyre really ghastly fraction magically combined perfectly good solid whole number nose doesnt feel right tome doesnt even feel possible mean course wan na check cant check back check right saying two twenty seven eighth one direction two three tooth one one magically bind perfect thirteen well believe see get twenty thats twenty seven fourth plus times plus ah force thats plus fourth plus fourth thats plus indeed whoa works yes actually encode coefficient interesting version something could cal led base whatever wow um course wondering whisper tic weird base well example let go still know ordinary thematic thats plus sort base version would another plus add something ill go left right plus plus plus plus know theres gon na r three two leave one behind three exploit become two leaving one behind remain touch look really look like need basic arithmetic machine fact optional homework optional mean dont circumstance go current math textbook convert everything base language space hard slanguage well fun well confuse book next right actually wonderful wild crazy done basic arithmetic seem work natural question arithmetic work example division weird base work way dont know try actually start gon na kil led like hard core decimal mean mean first think name call thing way sort decimally way call work fraction give expansion fact theres interesting question machine fact question actually unsolved day could brand new thinking brand new math amazing um stop stop negative something strike play discover something new negative bases irrational bases wow universe wonder delight mystery intrigue coming simple dot box es machine astounding forefront mathematics research go fun play month year little fun hereright wonderful stuff
