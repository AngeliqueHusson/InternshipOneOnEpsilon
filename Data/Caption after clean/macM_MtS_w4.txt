today going talking problem logic problem alan almost inadvertently modern digital computer start back beginning century mathematician problem logic interested finding conclusion premise start argument know beginning assumption conclusion bit want establish bit reason argument want know test tell us yes sure premise dont entail conclusion automatic way finding whether whether dont thats problem cal led decision problem mathematician wan ted find answer decision problem first order logic thats kind logic learn philosophy mathematics university lots mathematician trying work first order logic decidable automatically test whether premise entail one first discover first order logic prove really difficult conceptually able show possible program give answer show something every possible program cant run every program one one came brilliant solution idea goes something like suppose program let draw black box going take input going give us output sour program going solve problem problem like conclusion ask question give us answer yes another question ask let look thinking black box es moment might want know program given certain input going give us answer going trundle forever never give us answer going halt going halt eventually think computer running want give answer whether good answer bad answer better answer answer would mean computer trundle around forever ever loop would never know whether going finish today tomorrow halting good theres another question ask given program input ever halt turns logical problem premise entail conclusion similar halting problem fact solve logical problem solve program halt input clever part proof show impossible machine however clever solve halting problem tell us whether given machine given input halt suppose weve got machine program solve problem solve halting problem dont worry works let think black box taking description machine input giving us answer yes halt wont halt suppose thats possible call machine h halting problem give transform different machine like stick extra give yes answer make loop forever without ever stopping give answer going halt straight away let call big machine whole thing h another question ask happen feed whole machine going put h hin question feeding h question h halt given input h goes wrong h plus halt get yes answer loop doesnt halt hand doesnt halt get answer halt halt doesnt halt doesnt halt halt either way get contradiction paradox show star ted assuming solve problem weve ended paradox assumption turns theres possible machine possible program solve halting problem really clever bit idea doesnt matter kind program machine doesnt matter whether abstract algorithm whether real computer physical doesnt matter weve prove program part argument say little bit whats going black box es idea every card represent instruction machine
