music welcome back math g studio rober good friend behind camera today going talking polynomial stuff little weird dont know whats going second see gon na click right place thats hope see gon na make sense let jump right first guess concept teach book concept degree alright degree basically highest value exponent thats something like x fourth thats degree four case look entire polynomial multiplying anything would degree two sometimes like ona fourth would degree seven actually multiply even though dont combine power exponent culminate power seven degree seventh would degree four understand degree keeping back mind gon na video let learn conquer particular polynomial us subtract two pretty much combining like term important thing keep mind sort like subtract ing whole thing mean negative three term three sign change inside cal led negative go ahead would result negative x squared plus minus parentheses serve purpose take x minus combine like combining like go squared minus x squared result squared negative sin negative negative sin negative z ebb like everything negative n negative minus pretty much distribute negative well plus problem add like term sok everyone would friendly sometimes multiplying polynomial minus temptation bring cube negative oh people love gon na put big fat non equal people think times would cube negative times negative times negative would minus cube work way multiply binomial together visualize write side side going start two three let stake take wah wah wive live minus people call foil first outer inner last basically distributive property multiply done negative multiply let go ahead x times squared times negative negative negative times two thats minus squared nope plus squared minus month plus important lesson right afraid make mistake comes territory fact theres research say making mistake way brains grow believe research cant afraid make mistake thats way brains get bigger bigger brain must enormous make mistake time let combine like term inhere squared negative negative minus x plus squared problem halfway done one minus go write left right thing right experience writing front little smoother explain k let make little space take bring note like write really small think theyre saving paper something like remember dad used k id like use would say like education worth thats would say dont afraid really stretch write large charge education worth long paper help learn thats right waste paper really want spread page minimize mistake k notice trying write really big aswell use white board go distributive property gon na times power cube negative x negative thats two times squared squared plus squared right half gon na keep eye negative times right goi going blue actually negative times squared squared student write line welcome right going show cool technique help keep track like term would negative squared thats right minus squared kind cool ready add negative times negative x x squared negative times positive squared thats negative cube right gon na add problem complete nice x squared plus squared minus cube right basically first two thing said first last middle action dont forget squaring two term write distribute right thank watching mass g well see bye music
