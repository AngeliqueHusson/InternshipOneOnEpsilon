everything weve done dealt even though might c artesian c artesian draw axis hopefully familiar review draw axis c artesian actually apply dimension tend deal want specify point dimensional space tell far x direction go far direction specify point like let see said well let give point right might say well get point right go right right go end convention call call call comma convention say far x direction go far direction comma could gone right could gone right wed gotten exact point one way really specify point option might done everyday life say hey let point direction go certain distance direction could said know let point direction let point direction need go far need go far direction would also get point specify direction well call degree show call call degree sand well deal hopefully know convert could easily convert could specify direction call k theta degree want point degree know could always imagine someone blindfolded point direction say walk r unit sand theyll end point could also specify point instead c artesian x comma could also specify maybe figure way ill magenta also specify r comma theta essentially say know walk r unit sin theta direction well let figure think kind abstract might little difficult understand going break little trigonometry actually little theorem figure r theta well r hopefully easier one think right triangle right triangle distance distance right triangle r squared plus squared equal hypotenuse squared r squared could say squared plus squared equal r squared thats plus equal r equal r squared dont want deal negative distance equal r r equal enough already figured r equal figure theta know know well trying figure theta know opposite side right going back write completely unfamiliar might want watch basic trigonometry video know opposite side theta right thats also know adjacent side thats trig function opposite adjacent well toa opposite adjacent tangent tangent theta equal opposite really equal adjacent tangent theta equal solve essentially take inverse tangent sides thing depending calculator convention use might write take inverse tangent sides get well ill write could write arc tan tangent theta equal arc tan course arc tan tangent thing inverse tan tangent theta equal theta theta equal arc tan another way write arc tan often theyll ill write exact statement could written tan inverse negative power sometimes say although little misleading sometimes write like dont know oh taking whole tangent theta negative power something sometimes ill write arc tan negative power either figure theta taking arc tangent people arc tangent memorize dand dont know easy way figure without getting let get right know arc tan want get calculator little higher want get inverse tan right press second inverse tangent divided already set calculator degree mode give theta equal already knew could specify point plane point x equal equal also specify r equal theta equal ill write polar r equal theta say k orient x axis walk unit sand get exact point thats polar telling another one actually let see come something general general always solve particular let write arbitrary point last time gave specific point point comma think let say point x comma right convert r polar theta well let thing last video length r angle theta going last video use theorem say x squared plus distance also right distance theorem get x squared plus equal r squared thats theorem tangent theta tangent adjacent tangent theta equal opposite adjacent x really wan ted go one step actually something write side paper express function go way given r theta could get well let think want know let see given r want figure theta deal rand respect theta r hypotenuse opposite let write deal opposite sine theta equal opposite side equal hypotenuse r equal rand multiply sides r get r sine theta equal let way wan ted equation theta r x x adjacent angler still hypotenuse deal adjacent hypotenuse well thats cosine theta equal adjacent equal x hypotenuse r multiply sides r get x equal r cosine theta really equip ped formula really comes trig formula know similar comes comes really know given first given two easily derive one one actually fully equip ped convert polar rectangular well next video time
