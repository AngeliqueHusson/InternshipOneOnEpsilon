complex number minus plotted complex see real part weve gone horizontal axis real axis imaginary part negative weve gone along vertical axis right point minus want think absolute value minus reminder absolute value whether talking complex number real number literally mean distance away absolute value minus going distance origin complex plane point point minus distance right going absolute value minus think well could literally set right triangle use theorem let think wan ted set right triangle height distance negative well distance going base triangle distance going definitely right angle horizontal line vertical use theorem figure absolute value minus distance point hypotenuse right triangle use theorem side squared squared plus side squared plus squared going equal absolute value minus squared absolute value squared squared plus squared thats plus get equal absolute value minus know take absolute value something distance going positive want take positive square root principal square root sides going left well principal square root positive square root equal absolute value minus another way saying thing right going equal distance right equal without draw one way could think ill real imaginary could literally take take sum take square root another way taking didnt want visualize really could say well going equal take real part squared take imaginary part squared let write add together take square root principal root principal root positive square root thats going square root equal
