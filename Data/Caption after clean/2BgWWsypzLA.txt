let say decimal keep write would look something like keep going forever want right pause video think whether represent decimal infinite sum infinite series think whether infinite series geometric series assuming youve given go let think term infinite going represent one example make first term could vie wed represent could make next termor next term represent thing next well point eight would keep going like going keep going like hopefully theres pattern essentially throwing four decimal every time keep going like infinite sum infinite series next question geometric series well order geometric series go one term next must multiplying value common ratio multiplying go one right add four multiplying well move decimal four spot left multiplying negative fourth could view multiplying negative go well thing move decimal four place left multiplying look pretty clear common ratio negative fourth power rewrite business times common ratio first common ratio negative fourth power give right plus times negative fourth first power give us value right plus times negative second power keep going form look little bit clearer like geometric series infinite geometric series wan ted write sigma notation could write sum infinity well first term going going times common ratio could write either negative fourth write negative negative fourth k th power k th power next interesting question clearly geometric series well sum might say well thats going want express fraction want pause video use would already know finding sum infinite geometric series try express thing right fraction assuming youve go let think weve already seen weve already derived previous video sum infinite geometric series let neutral color series like k equal infinity k power sum going equal r weve derived actually several case going well going minus common ratio minus ill write like ten thousandth whats going well going thing take minus ten could ten thousandth minus thousandth going ten could view let write doesnt look thing subtract ing going get going times times whats top number times thats going give us weve expressed fraction might say well maybe simplify thing let see already fraction weve already kind achieve want get little bit see add plus plus divisible clearly divisible let divide goes let see goes one time subtract get times get another times exactly six times numerator longer divisible sum divisible multiple divide bottom number get think simplified think simplified well well could check know didnt either way written pretty neat saw decimal infinite series infinite geometric series able use formula derived sum infinite geometric series actually express fraction
