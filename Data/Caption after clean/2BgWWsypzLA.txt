let say decimal keep write would look something like keep going forever want right pause video think whether represent decimal infinite sum infinite series think whether infinite series geometric series assuming youve given go let think term infinite series going represent one example make first term could vie wed represent could make next term next term represent thing next well point eight would keep going like going keep going like hopefully theres pattern essentially throwing four decimal every time keep going like infinite sum infinite series next question geometric series well order geometric series go one term next must multiplying value common ratio multiplying go one right add four multiplying well move decimal four spot left multiplying negative fourth could view multiplying negative go well thing move decimal four place left multiplying look pretty clear common ratio negative fourth power rewrite business times common ratio first common ratio negative fourth power give right plus times negative fourth first power give us value right plus times negative second power keep going form look little bit clearer like geometric series infinite geometric series wan ted write sigma notation could write sum infinity well first term going going times common ratio could write either negative fourth write negative negative fourth k th power k th power next interesting question clearly geometric series well sum might say well going want express fraction want pause video use would already know finding sum infinite geometric series try express thing right fraction assuming go let think already seen already derived previous video sum infinite geometric series let neutral color series like k equal infinity k power sum going equal r derived actually several case going well going minus common ratio minus write like ten thousandth going well going thing take minus ten thousandth could ten thousandth minus thousandth going ten could view let write doesnt look thing subtract ing going get going times times top number times well going give us expressed fraction might say well maybe simplify thing let see already fraction already kind achieve want get little bit simpler let see add plus plus divisible clearly divisible let divide goes let see goes one time subtract get times get another times exactly six times numerator longer divisible sum divisible multiple divide bottom number get think simplified think simplified well well could check know didnt either way written pretty neat saw decimal infinite series infinite geometric series able use formula derived sum infinite geometric series actually express fraction decimal infinite geometric series khan academy decimal infinite geometric series khan academy decimal infinite geometric series khan academy
