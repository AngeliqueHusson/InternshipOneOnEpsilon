hi coming another math video help boost score math class improve understanding hopefully make learning math lot less stressful video going talk work area formula rhomb plural rhombus right multiple rhombus way use formula right area equal one half diagonal diagonal pretty easy formula diagonal distance vertex opposite vertex see whole length diagonal whole length diagonal course n matter order multiplication commutative kite exact formula nice take whole length times whole length times give area quick refresher two consecutive pair sides congruent see sides congruent congruent congruent four sides congruent interesting thing note also diagonal actually perpendicular one another form right angle cross let look couple understand little bit better works say like want find area alright take whole diagonal see going tobe plus area going times times diagonal might saying n know piece right hereright well kite diagonal right line symmetry fold kite like angle see side side exact know like cut half exact line symmetry fold gon na segment length whole diagonal gon na multiply times times squared area triangle triangle sorry kite see interesting rhombus actually made formula comes look lot base times height right go ahead look next example want c video course specifically designed math section got different covered help know boost score test go ahead check last example last one gon na find area rhombus notice four sides congruent know rhombus see diagonal perpendicular formula going one half diagonal times case give us side length n give us diagonal well see triangle one special right triangle need review go ahead check video special right triangle side according special right triangle side going right side going square root also bisect rhombus square root also square root put together whole diagonal square root whole diagonal going multiply get times square root squared us exact area rhombus hope learned something hereabout finding area r om eye ahead subscribe channel check past video see next video talk soon finding area rhombus finding area rhombus finding area rhombus
