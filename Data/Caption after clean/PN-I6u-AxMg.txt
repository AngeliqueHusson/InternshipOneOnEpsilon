let put handful chess piece infinite chessboard according usual rule far move win many understand infinite chef let start finite chess test kind like one game perfect information mean everything open poker relevant information hand test doesnt involve randomness chance like involve dice often harder analyze cant guarantee answer chess two provided play standard rule position game finite number move assume exclude simpler mathematician many favorite example kind chef checkers go dot many check links description learn chef even finite version complicated let start simpler game single tile version nim ill call pile start big pile marbles al ice bob alternate taking one two three marbles pile person last marble say start five al ice take three bob could take one lose al ice take final one better idea take final two hell game seem little boring strategy behind pretty cool start n marbles whats best strategy al ice bob havent seen problem strongly recommend different starting trying find strategy make game tree pile game sort like diagram possible start five marbles al ice pick either one two three marbles theyll three two left respectively map bob trace way bob time someone take last marble mark win notice al ice winning strategy method guarantee win first one marble bob take one two three regardless respond way guarantee win definition one player game strategy optimal ly al ice win long take win let define doomsday clock doomsday clock tell us many move sit inevitable case twin way thats math term call game value chess call matin look game five beginning doomsday clock three al ice force win move doomsday clock two matter bob hell lose two move goes clock one meaning al ice win make turn important definition us game determined one player winning strategy important theorem known theorem every game type weve talking perfect information randomness alternating ending finite number move kind determined actually use game tree prove mall os theorem tree ill let fill detail proof give entirely different fruit let us know thinking comment big deal well one chess normal finite version determined either strategy white strategy guarantee win course nobody know strategy mostly game tree really huge move world infinite could last infinitely many move big theorem finite determined analogous question infinite one player strategy well like pretty much every time step finite world infinite get weird er whether infinite determined complicated issue depending surprisingly set theory axiom choose within standard system type infinite determined determined purpose infinite chef sis determined winning strategy starting player infinite chess winning strategy let get precise infinite chess white black one king board always goal capture sides king normal checkmate importantly checkmate always happen finite time game number piece possibly infinitely many starting arrangement piece move normally theyre unbounded example king hop one direction bishop move diagonally far infinite chest determined ask different white black win given starting position long take force whats doomsday clock starting position white guarantee win six move stuck needs move rook white move rook keep king check black move king white follow queen white queen rook continue squeeze black king barricade stuck forced checkmate first move whats doomsday clock well black ha sa option move rook like lose six move something silly like move one case white win two move well situation say doomsday clock six thats longe st black hold king capture maximum time game end doomsday clock infinite episode dis cussed infinite ordinal infinite counting natural first infinite ordinal omega comes omega plus omega omega times omega times plus omega times omega times omega omega omega omega omega let look like except theres line pawn blocking rook notice thing black rook move make way king white queen rook continue chase black king get trapped rook difference black rook move far want first turn rook move away take white queen rook trap black king whats doomsday clock say initial position well rook move first turn longer game last black rook move arbitrarily large finite number white eventually huge finite number black king since theres limit far away rook move theres limit number game could last doomsday clock maximum length game last must bigger must first infinite ordinal omega finite unbounded length doomsday clock infinite champion incredible amount infinite chest mathematics came chess position loo ked starting position infinite chess doomsday clock omega square two separate times black delay inevitable death arbitrarily large number even example infinite chess doomsday clock omega squared omega fourth weve linked result bunch description theres many cool infinite chef could make several episode construct interesting starting position infinite chess someone winning strategy let us know comment see next week infinite series hello wan ted respond comment fair division episode several made interesting point real life might always pick free room theres another room cheap way better free room probably pick one order get math work nicely make assumption mathematical model one assumption made inside model would always choose free room non free room right math e stuff showing theres odd number fully odd number access outside even number access outside odd number plus even number number odd number total room check elevating moment ask intriguing question read system lie order get better outcome maybe might also get worse outcome might end room hate id really curious see one come example outcome maybe make sit worse alright see next week
