hello session time speed distance topic form key part various quantitative aptitude mathematical aptitude section competitive exam require alogical bent mind able solve question discuss various item theory various important concept formally take leading example make key clear let us get star ted study time speed distance time speed distance said interesting topic let us assume car moving fixed point fixed point moving object traversing distance three time car cover distance distance speed object moving let draw simple diagram explain relation car traveling distance along direction let us say distance distance let us say body moving car car seem modern car let put red light top flashing red light moving speed let us say take total time entire distance know object always equal distance upon time let elaborate formula make crystal clear speed body object equal distance covered object upon time taken cover distance know written equal upon fundamental assumption discussion far speed object constant moving fixed speed however always object may cover different distance swith different speed case say object variable speed pattern anyway come later let us assume speed constant formula speed equal distance upon time equal us three arise primary formula us look three important logical relationship solve directly relationship let us get basic formula speed equal distance upon already told speed fixed variable distance took time let us seethe three three first speed distance upon time mean distance covered constant speed time distance covered cal led constant inversely time mean suppose covered three different object distance object object b object c naturally distance fixed whichever object whichever car higher speed take lesser time hence fixed distance speed vari es inversely time hope clear first relationship fixed distance speed vari es inversely time important logical relation used solve number two formula get time equal distance upon speed mean time taken constant distance speed let us say car traveling onwards say time taken car cover distance time taken car cover distance distance covered directly proportional speed hope clear object time cover distance directly vari es speed hope clear third example distance speed time derived basic formula mean speed object constant distance vari es distance traveled vari es directly time also obvious car question moving fixed speed obvious cover vary directly time going dear student three relation us basic formula speed equal distance upon time take time understand three logically use later solve dis cussed ear lier difference uniform speed variable speed let us understand greater length uniform speed object cover equal distance time interval say object uniform speed however small distance may however small time interval may whereas say object variable speed thus object car example ant ora space shuttle cover different time said variable speed let us turn attention measurement conversion various measurement time speed distance time measured per ar second mi n h r h sense measured k naturally speed per second per hour per measurement one extremely careful measurement us focus conversion another important aspect trying solve question right saw time measured second minute similarly saw distance measured kilometer naturally speed measured per second kilometer per hour per hour let us look length conversion r equal minute equal second equal second kilometer equal equal mile equal point six zero nine kilometer bring interesting relation equal remember one yard one fee inch es equal per second important memorize get simple one kilometer per r equal derived numerator second denominator solve get mean multiply get per second convert meter per second per hour multiply given value meter get converted kilo meter per r equal per hour mean convert kilometer per r per hour convert per r kilometer per hour hope absolutely clear us basic learning definition speed distance upon time saw three basic relation distance time speed respectively constant saw uniform variable speed sand various conversion time us get concept question important concept man speed ratio n ratio times taken cover distance becomes n know original learning distance fixed know speed time taken hence speed ratio order cover distance ratio time taken change n let us see question based basic concept question based simple concept let walking usual boy reach es school minute late find usual time reach school let us solve question speed boy usual speed concept deed know time taken boy usual time taken basically mean usual time mean usual time mean plus usual time actually usual time extra time taking speed gone speed extra time taking reach school mean reaching late covered extra time taking thats late late amount late minute mean normal circumstance time would taken would minute thus goes usual speed take minute reach school hence solve practice properly solve speed become time become plus answer solve mentally second practice let us see one question concept second question walking late usual rate girl take minute less school find usual time taken girl reach school let us solve fact since already solve question concept solve question mentally look screen going usual speed mean time taken upon usual time mean usual timeless mean mean twice time mean regular time nineteen point solve less second let us write solve speed usual speed mean time girl going take sincere girl walking faster usual important class today exam time going upon usual time mean upon usual time usual time minus usual time reach increase speed led saving time like previous example usual time taken early easily solve equal divided nineteen point five mean normally nineteen point five minute concept seen saw basic concept man speed ratio n time taken change ratio n mand saw two question based concept move next concept time speed move interesting concept cal led average speed suppose abody move point x point yat speed body path point point x speed v ask average speed body entire journey perhaps say u plus v would wrong answer average speed tobe calculated first us see
