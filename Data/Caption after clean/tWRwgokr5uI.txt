video ill show guy central angle term also show guy prove first well start sister alcohol put center circle right call well pick two point circle let pick point call hung point c central angle connect center center see right central angle thats one less degree aby definition course right outer piece right want anyway going pick another point circle arc anywhere first picture let put point right call point b connect b b c angle right central room saying angle center right twice big angle right example today know right mean right tobe times degree let statement angle room measure c based label ing right two times measure angle pretty much statement might wondering could b right show guy later path proof picture put b thats good anyway let focus picture first first ought remember right center circle go center circle radius thats also radius know right furthermore actually connect b center well fair connected center right also radius looking triangle left right triangle isosceles triangle know big angle dont call x moment put x know angle also x two sides theres two angle right know big anchor dont dont know angle would right would know pick another variable call say angle also tell right yas well reason two sides right well look angle triangle left angle right x x right thats minus x like similarly look angle go c degree minus minus thats minus thats idea going make connection angle orc angle right see angle b c x plus k id way let find measure angle c based know attitude sixteen right middle right must minus already know minus angle also know right minus angle minus like rest actually algebra well right minus minus minus becomes plus minus minus minus becomes plus good stuff minus zero combine e thats good x plus left factor write times x plus x plus look back x plus exactly angle b c right x measure angle b c one case central angle theorem alright hopefully like far done yet b p start place p sare mean like somewhere right example see picture pretty similar actually ill try produce best picture possible dont know anyway let say c still right angle time pick point b right sadly bizarre huh see connect dot b c like still saying angle biggest go ten huh know bizarre like exactly think connect dot work right let see still like connect point b center like learning new thing right first ring go time call x notice radius radius though know two sides right two sides looking triangle go c b call tobe ill call base angle call angle x already big angle minus label right minus x hopefully picture clear beauty geometry right radius right also radius look triangle b also triangle right minus x mean angle also minus x good huh let see else dook ay far thats angle right want come angle radius maybe minus let take look angle x big angle well little angle minus x minus right vertical angle vertical angle angle right minus x minus let see cant anything right finally let take look big angle right see tear stamen right measure always want come c first thats right right al c based time ready start measure angle c looking triangle everything instead triangle right angle stop minus angle minus x angle minus degree yeah sometimes say degree sometimes really matter expression algebra nice right degree become plus going minus degree minus minus becomes plus x negative cancel plus also equal plus x thats end x x exactly angle yes still times measure angle b c good proof right hopefully like guy new channel please subscribe like make video guy always thats music
