number e defined limit x approach es infinity plus x x number first introduce na pier used base natural log na pier discoverer inventor logarithm wondering expression approaching may little test give value x find value plus x x example give x value would plus first power course thats going give increase x let say expression becomes plus calculator get two point five nine three seven four two four six bunch let say dramatically increase let say expression becomes plus calculator going get two point seven one six nine two three nine whole bunch keep drastically increasing number let say x one plus one raised power calculator going get two point seven one eight two six eight two three seven see keep increasing number n keep increasing drastically x matter see right two course seven seven let say one step let say million million would plus million raised million get calculator whole bunch right see also get two um spend rest life never exactly calculate e irrational number find exactly pi cannot found exactly um expression bump give substitution example x call x would u k apply substitution expression e limit instead plus x instead x going u instead x top going u k x approaching infinity x approach es infinity approach mean e also limit use u x variable n variable choose doesnt matter limit x approach es plus x x could also another substitution instead substitution call plus call u x would u minus subtract going get minus u u mean x x equal flip going get x going equal u mean e also limit instead x going u instead exponent x going minus x approach es infinity infinity expression going approach u going equal mean going able u approaching therefore e also also write limit x approach es x raised x minus x may bump expression useful remember try memorize calculating thing calculus see limit know e could also bump form e form probably already seen e study ing natural log compound interest probability also see many course indifferential integral calculus
