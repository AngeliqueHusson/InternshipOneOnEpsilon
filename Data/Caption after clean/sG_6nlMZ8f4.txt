amazing never able look way show way work radius circle got something special today sequence want able work next number sequence fraction going one one one one something lots ways could show solve today going show special way solve going put need get equipment got drawing circle goodness ever ever done video like paper precise use precision instrument second circle circle number look tha tokay exactly theyre half diameter big circle going fun actually get hard get kiss theyre kissing kissing circle wed say tangentially though theyre kissing oh brad know hard get four circle kiss know hard know toi confess done times best time blue circle radius blue circle one fifteenth big circle han g let keep going papist chain one circle touching inside another circle kissing fitting touching oneanother big touch fest today thing around long time one touching touching touching one new blue circle one one twenty third original radius one twenty third third good look beautiful z en next one little guy happen one thirty ninth original large go dont know much compass use guy radius third original radius big circle whats next one going well let draw shall question radius circle reference first circle theres plenty ways could actually work could get busy ruler start drawing triangle maybe start getting angle maybe start kind theorem whatnot try get one way solve problem absolutely amazing absolutely way solve problem going show actually amazingly hard core huge amount information dealing going try show need problem hopefully go look stuff time something go brad f trust going show exactly need problem imagination fired thats thinking thats good way solve problem circle inversion theres quick introduction think people seen reflection correct think youve got eyeball eyeball know reflection work right see mirror opposite actually going distance going quite rough brad thats right know work dont eyeball eyeball looking back right cal led going special type reflection solve problem cal led circle works first got start circle circle going circle inversion first need need need know radius thats really important brad case radius put point say put point point going point origin happen inversion first going measure oh know equal point actually going invert take length right know multiply point going dont know yet equal circle radius squared equal squared case times want go equal squared divide quick little calculation goes twice mean equal weve done weve actually taken point way exactly line length oh dash length equal times radius squared inverted point whether inside circle outside outside go inside based formula thats circle inversion want see circle inversion please right drawn circle within circle inversion weve inverted one point happen point infinite number point sin circle going take circle invert going invert circle thats right think going happen point stell well instinct yeah draw another circle somewhere great beyond going circular would instinct oval instinct another circle g youve got point inverted point see closer circle inversion closer side divide well huge cos one invert way already got unusual right wow look weve actually gone original place one huge different reflection scaled scaled invert find get point edge see theyre touching one point touch one point touch measure length times length well get squared circle invert circle dont sho wed go back star ted circle outside comeback one thing need know well circle happen overlap circle inversion could think happen happen circle brad well still get circle well definitely still get circle point little important invert point fraction yeah exactly thats going start come big yep whats weve already seen circle see two point already know going inverted circle touch line intersect line exactly see brad weve done inversion circle crossed crossed kind little bit see still make another circle one going show one got show say important prove thing going prove today ill show one weird circle actually origin well think well theres point origin right whats length origin origin zero really going blow point get close origin going get huge towards infinity really talking massive circle know massive like line circle origin circle inversion invert line behold check look circle inversion amazing look circle invert two goes small small goes big circle circle inversion still look like circle think stunning circle origin invert toa straight line need two fact kind fact fact two thats need information circle inversion actually solve problem well need first need make decision sort circle actually going use invert way solve get bad boy going actually going circle inversion exactly original circle original circle going put origin circle inversion right end green dotted line circle inversion going work circle inversion remember got exactly radius original circle thats important remember said brad thing need know inversion need know two circle go circle inversion still virtuous circle unless part circle goes center origin circle inversion turns straight wrong bingo reason came able invert circle sand ruler right able show beautiful simple interpret problem big circle brad big circle invert well first center inversion know coz going turn straight line straight line going well know dont calculate anything already know intersect circle inversion radius point goes back know point straight line intersect circle inversion know one exactly straight away need two point final line yeah know actually really simply draw weve put first inverted circle next circle circle also center origin kiss es inside kiss es inside inversion circle mean going invert straight line exactly going going straight line like like well let look circle circle going invert two touch point origin point origin effect infinity two touch infinity well kind tricky stuff thats parallel thats thats explanation really see logic draw simple rule circle go logic well goes anything else eventually hit mean point must point back know doesnt happen theres origin point deductively reason happen brad big circle one circle one happen circle well measure anything circle touch es big circle circle already know circle line circle line touching really one thing circle circle well let draw move circle inversion circle inverted circle guy invert one well straightaway know two point invert well theyre circle another point well one circle even though actually diagram inverted circle remember thats going actually going guy two touch right touching circle circle think able see whats going circle touching circle circle circle inversion two circle mean another circle exactly radius exactly diameter see much symmetry beautiful awesome brad mean symmetry breath taking inverted world still get brad theres another blue one guy one fifteenth original radius told actually invert guy circle circle circle circle circle actually circle guy kissing one two three purple one two three know blue guy actually touch three rule kiss real life kiss exactly little circle inversion blue circle one really want one get well weve inverted one two going invert guy know becoming simple know circle touch guy touching circle touch touching big circle know line know circle line straightforward process draw circle sin one top another chain circle getting progressively smaller smaller smaller inversion end top exactly radius exactly diameter theyre fitting two parallel absolutely beautiful one one one one one think chain touching circle touching circle inversion weve already seen blue circle invert pattern going stay theres going circle going circle theyre going circle circle bit going exactly size work diameter work diameter weve got radius seriously epic right go weve got aright angle know circle even though thats tiny center circle pass center circle massive right angle triangle know length invert length give us length circle passing origin little circle tell diameter divide two tell us radius shall let bring home tell absolutely epic pretty though whole whole length circle inversion half going right circle half right thats four little blue inverted circle quarter thats actually going know whole length way across take equal thats length equal long guy well distance going plus plus plus thats going r plus r thats r plus r weve whole length thats huge want weve got worked length length work hypotenuse center circle inversion center blue circle work comes sixteen actually want know distance oh dashed know invert right back small circle also want know oh oh let one first know b dash equal plus radius small circle oh going back going back radius look like take end want invert want take back let invert end ah thing oh bring back tiny little circle mean either inverted end weve got b know center know take get diameter small circle happen make thats take radius half diameter radius small circle radius small circle equal one know original circle divide give us radius mean
