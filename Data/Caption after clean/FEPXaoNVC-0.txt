video going explain reason stick multiplication works also known even lying multiplication many might argue method came china japan even going argue may well right canada considering curriculum might go teaching multiplication record idea came really care however really care method works think trick thats looking procedural perspective alone start back good old reliable method row right talking times saying show group column column two row pretty cool another example grade math curriculum need give ton practice working multiplication concretely one important representation get bigger like often helpful show number group sand number item group also known factor like see note arrangement might look familiar often traditionally organized multiplication tables multiplication chart build array clear one group quantity equal quantity group seven equal pretty cool eh continue building array practice skip double triple useful skill advocate would love see improve student super cool discuss benefit learning multiplication also help us understand stick line multiplication actually works well get closer start looking group would really suck build array case luckily somebody thought base make building array large factor easier let group rod plus got one rod give number individual represent piece pretty cool way probably guess us piece order number rod plus single multiply focus ing first rod like multiplication table multiply times see space product base block use flat instead hundred individual rod look empty space top right array note multiply factor remain ing factor order get sum logic remain ing factor multiply rod get rod multiply get final product one make connection stick line multiplication time well look times times give us hundred hundred flat times five going give us five ten rod weve got times twenty two times five ten add partial end total product easy stuff right let make connection first hide value base since youve clean screen little bit gon na really start explicitly lining gap base block let spread little bit even going toss might going line stick method ultimately right front face right real explicit factor array dont get confused see factor far left top screen product bottom right hundred rod basically stick line multiplication simply skipping step drawing ten block focus intersection base ten sticks prior drawing sticks basically looking intersection white space base let shrink block closer look gon na shrink guy really focus intersection point give hundred left corner look five factor ten rod factor us five base rod going shrink going show explicitly five point intersection ten rod two factor ten rod factor get ten rod two two point intersection finally two yield ten point intersection like ten product gon na put right top point sort see base ten block sand sticks represent ing product times youve never built conceptual understanding multiplication works array base ten block use stick method always trick likely cause error frustration point road however conceptual understanding behind base block work likely able use stick method quick visual representation serve conduit concrete symbolic standard algorithm typically see sticks line method til ted diagonally well thats likely many line method likely idea works might need assistance organize solution however also suggest going make error road possibly even forget procedure even works first place let check thing actually tilt thing little bit gon na see line sand sticks organized someone doesnt understand see organized place value mean intersection hundred flat far left tilt sticks manner point represent ten rod middle point sin far right represent take look sum hundred first column far left column middle column ten right column dealing place value right represent seven ten cant number greater nine column base trade ten base ten rod leaving us eight ten rod sand zero pretty cool trick also much powerful student could articulate comes works better yet student thorough understanding array base ten much rather challenge see could come easier way visually represent two digit multiplication paper without draw bunch rectangle might use sticks base ten block maybe maybe someone class might come something similar stick method cool would oh go know base multiply great way explain standard algorithm multiplication works let look look look array standard algorithm side side clearly see step algorithm first start multiplying five two get ten look five times one wait really five times ten since one column represent ten rod get partial product move multiply one two wait one represent ten rod result give us finally last partial product multiplying one ten rod another ten rod ten group ten one hundred flat sum partial product rive product probably make quick connection standard algorithm typically use basically first two together five times two five ten fifty get result notice carry multiplying times resulting rod similar step one process used multiply us rod rod us hundred combining two give us however still get result might look lot different base block really symbolic simplification process regardless method effective efficient personally great benefit conceptual understanding method choose actually works summary id like talk concreteness fading theory suggesting mathematical concept sare best learned three inactive stage student use concrete manipulative represent concept theyre working time student enough experience physically working concrete manipulative typically move iconic stage begin often naturally draw concrete manipulative instead physically hold manipulate object hand student become increasingly comfortable iconic visual representation make sense begin symbol represent meaning behind previous visual stage often thought abstract three used efficient way work previous two multiplication today look like relative three concreteness fading well comes single digit single digit multiplication unit beginning video array dont grab instead start drawing might look physical manipulative look like paper mind eye finally symbolic notation work head move digit one digit two digit two digit multiplication would useful use physical base ten experience look like like multiply possibly moving towards free virtual manipulative piece pad math learning center ministry education x math ease interactive manipulative free knowledge time student begin skip opt start drawing array base ten configuration paper possibly mind become proficient theyll begin symbolic notation conceptual multiplication algorithm known partial product forget kit connect piece symbolic notation inactive concreteness fading might opt use distributive property chunk comfortable start moving towards open area model show factor sand skip drawing base ten rod unit tile prior moving towards symbolic representation standard algorithm area model standard algorithm fact process simply different representation finally another possibility might moving physical base ten block drawing visual representation like stick line method explore today finally moving sort symbolic representation mental distributive property multiply hope found video helpful help understand stick multiplication method works also share importance building strong conceptual understanding mathematics concreteness fading exposed ways represent concept mathematics understanding continually deepen produce connection overtime ton interesting ways multiply please share comment enjoy thank
