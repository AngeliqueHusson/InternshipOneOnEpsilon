hi rob welcome math antic sin lesson gon na learn decimal arithmetic get star ted already know arithmetic regular whole sure watch video cover subject first really important going show modify procedure already learned video work decimal know procedure already video make much sense specifically make sure watched video addition subtraction multiplication long division know problem video decimal arithmetic hard procedure decimal arithmetic basically whole important difference need know gon na show video ready let start easy one addition whole key stack place line column ensure number place lined column add column starting place working left well decimal works way main difference instead lining place stack line decimal point instead wait minute thing lining place digit sah yes decimal reference mark always goes place tenth place lining decimal point thing lining place sit make sure number place line column snow probably decimal different decimal example one decimal digit two decimal digit sand mean line decimal point two decimal might form nice column right edge might missing problem remember digit particular number place put zero help keep track thing snow lined decimal point add instead starting place like always whole start whatever number place column furthest right case hundredth place start add column carrying get done right wrong one last really important step remember decimal addition forget decimal point need bring copy straight answer line keep reference point number place snow see answer really hard got good news decimal subtraction works way start lining decimal point two remember order matter subtraction sure number taking away bottom starting whatever column furthest right subtract borrowing need bring copy decimal point decimal addition subtraction pretty easy let move something little harder decimal multiplication know multiplication complicated many multiplication step good news decimal really make procedure much harder whole clever way make decimal multiplication look exactly like multiplication whole already know key pretend decimal point really hold minute like pretend ing much pretend decimal point even gon na get right answer well thing wrong answer decimal point right spot need fix know little example help understand knew would say let say need multiply seem little tricky pretend decimal point word pretended already know problem follow procedure learned multiplication part get answer answer times times time stop get correct answer decimal problem got understand going decimal point pretended truth pretended decimal point really pretend ing came whole technically decimal right next place need show since decimal decimal point really mentally shifting decimal point right top decimal point two place right bottom decimal point one place right change made top number times bigger decimal version made bottom number times bigger every time shift decimal point one number place right like multiplying factor mean answer got way big big three factor decimal point problem got total place right top bottom fix going shift decimal point answer amount opposite direction word need move decimal point answer place left make smaller factor starting right decimal point would answer shift place left end answer times cool trick huh mean decimal multiplication like regular multiplication start setting multiplication problem exactly like would decimal point invisible erase need end figure many place shift decimal point answer keep decimal point follow multiplication procedure answer count many place decimal point problem working f forget total shift top bottom decimal point sand shift decimal point answer left number decimal multiplication turns bad decimal division got ta hard right well division always little hard luckily decimal really make much harder fact decimal divisor procedure little different decimal dividend divisor whole number really simple long division procedure learned long division video decimal point effect need make sure bring copy decimal point answer line done division problem divided would follow division procedure decimal point even get answer line need bring copy decimal point straight final answer making dividend decimal number divisor dividend decimal like divide well first step panic see much harder turns simple trick use make divisor decimal number shift decimal point divisor right whole number also need shift decimal dividend amount right case want shift decimal point divisor one place right long also shift decimal point dividend amount turn really cool part new division problem divided get exactly answer would problem divided works decimal point divisor dividend amount direction realize works remember equivalent fraction divided right top bottom number would give equivalent even though different top bottom represent value one half equivalent faction well decimal division problem decimal point divisor dividend one number since fraction division basically made equivalent division problem one whole number divisor pretty cool huh mean solve divided get answer exactly answer get divided use trick avoid ever divide decimal divisor even dividend whole number example problem divided shift decimal divisor dividend one place right remember always decimal point even whole number shift right need put zero place shift past give equivalent division problem divided since division problem equivalent get answer alright modify traditional arithmetic procedure work decimal number sit little tricky first since extra step keep track decimal practice lot check answer calculator get remember always watch video need along video arithmetic always thanks watching math antic see ya next time learn math antic decimal arithmetic math antic decimal arithmetic math antic decimal arithmetic
