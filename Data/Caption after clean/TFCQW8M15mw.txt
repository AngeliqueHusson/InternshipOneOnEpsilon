video going another example quadratic equation square case x squared plus equal first thing going add sides add sides give us x squared plus going trick well really trick kind clever observation make thing make thing work whatever front x case positive take number positive going give us positive number square give us positive new number get thats going sides equation left side perfect square x squared plus plus going factor x plus times x plus write x plus plus going give us step take square root sides stick positive negative right side left side simply leaves x plus weve got positive negative square root thats nice hole number cant really simplify square root eleven either going leave alone two solution whoops x plus two square root eleven thats going give us one solve also take x plus two equal negative square root eleven well well simply subtract two well get x equal square root eleven minus two one nice whole number second one well subtract two sides get x equal negative square root eleven minus two solution
