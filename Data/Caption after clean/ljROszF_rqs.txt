j ill received number dollar left x approximate formula equal minus equation use graph estimate much money j ill days later let make table x use table actually plot graph ask us everything else want much money shell actually put right equation might well days going go back start start days days received dont even look equation whats days much money well chance spend yet could think could look equation see equation x value going minus part right time number days could one day later going decimal point part end clean multiply multiple days much money well going minus times ill order minus times times minus days going different plot point got information days going minus times times minus see every days goes spending every days every day actually see right spending thats negative dollar every day every time increment x goes away let keep going ill look another color days going minus times times minus equal finally could days days shell minus times times minus actually question estimate much money j ill actually let first partlet actually graph equation see visually let draw axes hand drawn graph think get job done let make axis case number dollar let make need focus first quadrant least context assuming wont negative number value positive assume days going positive deal negative x value always going positive going operating first quadrant thats draw start mark axis increment first would would would would could let mark days let ill yellow days days days days could keep going like days right days thats point right thats right days x direction go thats point right days go x remember days x x days actually mark axis dollar axis days days going color days finally days weve plotted point sand could connect could actually nice ruler could connect two would line line look something let new color line would look show much every day done weve equation know shell left days
