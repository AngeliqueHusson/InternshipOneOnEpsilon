hi video going exterior angle first learn exterior angle polygon well derive formula find sum polygon right let draw polygon first let polygon two point third point fourth point let fifth point yes pendulum right pentagon exterior angle polygon extend sides polygon newly formed angle scalled exterior angle right let call exterior angle number one know calling angle interior angle angle marking red calling interior angle right interior angle extend edge one side angle form extended edge next side cal led exterior angle right one rule extending like extended edge towards right extend edge towards right extend like exterior angle since extended two towards right extend towards right edge extended direction extend edge extend direction edge also extended direction right exterior angle newly formed angle exterior angle right since angle number one ill call one two one three one four one five right pentagon going five interior angle time also five exterior angle find sum exterior angle one method derive formula see point point point point point point vertices polygon right every point pair interior angle plus exterior angle right every point one interior angle one exterior angle one interior armor exterior say pair yes together making straight street angle right interior plus exterior angle equal n n number vertices right sum interior angle polygon sum interior angle n minus right plus sum exterior angle equal n right sum exterior angle n minus n right written n minus n plus right take comment two bracket n minus get bracket minus n plus right plus n minus n get actually degree yesso suggest polygon equal right
