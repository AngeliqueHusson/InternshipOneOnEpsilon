first look graph sine probably already learn graph previous lesson key thing want pay attention know although sine function c vertical line test inverse graph function see failing horizontal line test meaning draw horizontal line know crossing graph one point mathematician decided know get around fact function restrict domain restrict domain look gon na look part graph make little bit dark er see see vertical line test function horizontal line test meaning n cross inverse graph function actually graph inverse well graph inverse function switch x switching input output let look three key point let look point negative pi comma negative one gon na gon na write going going switch x going negative one negative pi two remember pi approximately divided two one point point really going tobe negative one negative one point graph negative pi two like negative one point five seven negative going right way go negative one point gon na right far point goes origin course zero zero interchange x exact gon na right point pi comma mark one pi switch x get pi pi one point five gon na graph point one going right one point five seven way going go seven rightabout graph graph going look like let see like one thing notice graph inverse function going reflection line x line slope like line going reflection line forget graph arc sine sine inverse function go ahead graph original graph restrict domain negative pi positive pi switch x three key point sand quick way get graph hope video subscribe channel check math tutor ing video math tutor ing look forward helping talk soon graph arc sin sine inverse graph arc sin sine inverse graph arc sin sine inverse
