welcome two us mormon tabernacle salt lake city whispering gallery us amazing property possess two room ill call spot b property someone stand point whisper something sound wave whispering quiet whispering go sound wave turns softly wall bounce amazingly head directly towards point matter sound wave coming bounce wall head directly towards b sound wave come hit ear perfectly distance sound wave crooked path turn tobe exactly length sound wave travel amount time arrive peace b b hear perfectly well whatever come hit even hear whisper absolute precise position mean reflection property special oval shaped curve scalled ellipse amazing property sound direction go bounce wall head towards second focal point point b exactly amount time always id prove today right set scene sure understand mean ill make sure understand mean ellipse go ahead prove ellipses property right first let stalk reflection go notch sophistication imagine straight wall obviously throw ball straight wall know swimming perfect world doesnt lose energy due forth bounce straight back come ball goes velocity v head back velocity v opposite direction give ball slight lateral motion throw angle vertical component velocity still moving constant horizontal component ball come total duel vertically going travel velocity v time well move distance horizontally vertical motion going going follow property threw directly vertical component dug go directly backwards time still travel horizontal distance way way come back distance vertical motion going magnitude opposite direction mean bouncing ball comes angle angle bounce since weve got congress guessing bounce angle theres property reflection mean ball object always hit straight wall equal incoming angle equal outgoing angle physical business actually use slightly different version angle call angle incidence angle reflection basically two equal angle right thats straight wall make sure understand happen curved wall thats little bit tricky let let draw curved wall pen imagine ball comes bounce curved wall whats going going bounce back dont understand mean right bouncing local phenomenon right mean us zoom picture got sort picture like would let make little flatter guess ball bounce like yonder well actually thats local phenomenon zoom right see war basically going best human estimation could straight er keep physicalness mar assuming ball straight really gone idea calculus taking thing extreme limit whats gon na happen ball far ball tell right sort degree thats really bouncing section straight wall cant tell difference curved straight ideal sense well straight wall know comes incidence reflection mean term going backwards picture thats picture practical purpose humanist zoom millions millions power look like straight wall mathematical sense infinite degree whatever mean talking calculus straight wall straight line really guess need pen different color theres straight line guess straight line slightly curved straight slightly curve straight line slightly curve whats really though ball bouncing tangent line curve point contact fora ball reflect curved let get pen back go go sa curved wall ball comes point bounce point though bouncing tangent line curve incidence reflection ball sound wave bounce curve also come tangent line great thats reflection whats ellipse well per usual know back step ellipse special case circle make circle imagine nail wall took loop string one end string nail pull stuck impact took pen pencil put right end loop pull loop taut around gon na start tracing curve clearly got fixed radius perfect circle well lip sis exactly idea except little bit funky end string end meet point wall well one special point point one end string tell must ring point b use pencil take loop string make taut pencil point swing pencil around keeping string taut thats going trace curve might fun actually play find happen swing way around geta circle shape thats squish circle shape ellipses curve two special point usually call foci first focus focus b location string mean true definition ellipse occur property two special point saint point p curve property distance p plus distance mean p b distance p plus p b fixed constant case length string thats ellipse right mean property ellipse start see connection whoops press wrong thing ellipse true foci mormon tabernacle actually made piece piece string work something alright claim reflection property sound wave coming position travel straight line bounce wall ah learned bouncing information tangent line ellipse right point equal angle equal reflection comes equal angle amazing thing apparently equal angle reflection head sound wave directly back b matter go got prove tangent line point ellipse always equal bad picture force sound wave actually bounce back b since links length string actually got additional profit sad way travel distance need prove reflection property ellipse point ellipse line connect ing point first make equal angle incidence reflection prove let start video actually proving right actually love proof come completely strange unexpected way go back beginning sense talk straight imagine problem moment theres wall dog currently position may would like walk position b dog dog would first like watch wall walk position base gon na walk straight line point wall theyre head straight question point contact brought doghead get b via wall might wonder maybe dogs directly point b hit straight maybe dog goes directly point head maybe dog go twixt b something head know position along wall b via wall answer question two different ways strangely completely different ways well see reflection properly ellipse pop let redraw picture solution number b maybe keep copy picture seem woman like usually right hey guy dont know special ill keep dont know special point blue one thing note hard deal inspired probably take long someone think trick tricky thing think situation bright spark point realize go b loo ked reflection part b side point b mean someplace point b run upon wall path b give mirrored path prime know nice perfectly symmetrical length length walking b father wall walking tobe prime wall length must double dash length double dash conversely give path goes point wall really correspond goes wall point b match length match es length actually shor test path b really given shor test path know answer problem whats shor test path two point well mean find special place wall dog walk imagine wall mirror walk reflection prime mirror point course dogs dont able wall people wont able walk second position said well turn way right let notice something look angle messy green bad well got pair crossing equal single since b prime reflection angle football angle ball actually answer problem dog walk place b give equal incidence reflection dog actually bouncing ball wall shor test path b via wall point equal angle like right thats answer number one answer number two indeed save picture yes clever answer number two problem gon na draw ellipses b first sign short string barely reach es across get sort fairly flat oval theres shor test short string longer string id get bigger said overall didnt said ellipse yes slightly bigger ellipse longer piece string really long piece string get huge ellipse theres longer piece string alright want find point ball wall give b right goes shor test distance made tobe silly well clearly bright blue ellipse correspond crooked path thats walking ball big enough hit wall green ellipse correspond crooked path b theres whole bunch different crooked path choose theyre theyre quite long enough hit wall hit matter dont hit wall let choose size ellipse wall special point length string hit ting wall perfectly right red ellipse doesnt much give point wall yes doubt point wall giving path b theres actually longer matching yellow path han g point silly sorry red path gosh bigger ellipse yellow one getting point wall cross want piece string therefore longer yellow one yellow lip first ellipse wall use touch es yellow path indeed answer dog walking problem length wall give crooked path b via wall tell special point dog walking problem point well got problem point p ellipse version must answer point b got situation reflection property perfectly point ellipse wall tangent line ellipse one ellipse proved answer mean answer problem property left angle left angle right line touch es wall point contact tangent line point contact exactly property make clear per usual missy order order ellipse point point bis first choose point p theres point p tangent dog walking problem go blue line back point give black ellipse must first ellipse touch es tangent line mean answer dog walking problem property first way dog walking problem equal angle side tangent line ellipse shaving reflection property sound wave tangent line bounce directly towards b distance matter analysis dog walking problem direction probably lip wonderful thing actually reflection chronic parabola hyperbola theyre ellipse actually prove sort way find right dog walking problem solve property hyperbola correct dog walking problem parabola mean sample reflection gon na shameless right go web site actually wrote third volume cover whole know high school curriculum actually final chapter comic understand ellipses parabola hyperbola geometry reflection might chapter get really three get really really stuck right go thanks much
