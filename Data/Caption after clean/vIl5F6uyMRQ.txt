even sure hey dont bother protect right good job let happy triangle triangle one important geometry sat lot much give example beginning every math section pretty interesting said theyre basically saying know coming look picture example future crazy love yeah picture give know lesson like dont know kind nonsense thats give beginning sat gon na talk let ready ready class gene guess well start let say triangle well draw one thats bad triangle first know scalled triangle please almost say better watch side ninety degree short leg around getting know know let hear two right right idea first let triangle type triangle yes right triangle correct type triangle yes isosceles good two equal two congruent well oh say two congruent angle know sides going congruent x grow piece yes opposite opposite angle effect also know hypotenuse going longer cal led leg hypotenuse going longer right thats easy component leg always leg always matter let go say three three say didnt know anything triangle could still solve hypotenuse theorem right go ahead know know let go squared plus b squared equal c squared whats right squared nine nine plus nine three squared plus three squared equal c squared c squared equal square root sides perfect square yeah split two number sand one perfect square case nine two square root square root key put anyone see leg hypotenuse yes right pretty much height hypotenuse yeah always adda rad could like like needs five ransom thats first major rule yes yeah thats picture exactly picture saying dude scuse whatever leg though leg like five five percent would five rad try example dont necessarily need time know right going erase want know dont want disrespect oh make look like alright give ten fill er yes yep ten times square make gon na say square root six getting whats best place like thats easy know yeah please leg going right keep mind always leg going root sir back said add asquare root right really square root multiplying good multiplying leg times square root square root times square root yes square root enough though right splitting two times root good let say werent sure whether right hypotenuse could always could check two times three six knot coincidence thats coincidence check whether leg hypotenuse correct correct relationship actually check stuff yeah yeah check pathetic right let really quick squared would squared six squared theres six whats rule square square root good plus six equal root squared c squared let two squared square root three squared need three two good thats check make could would roll sleeve cant yes theres room go
