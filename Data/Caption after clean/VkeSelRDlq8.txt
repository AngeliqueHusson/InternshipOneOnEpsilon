find area regular pentagon look something like five sides equal also equal used finding square find area figure let see let center pentagon center mean equidistant five vertices joining center vertices see five triangle formed equal think equal need find area one triangle multiply five get area entire pentagon also seen every regular polygon look like circle touch es side exactly one point circle every vertex polygon observe figure carefully five length equal radii circumcircle mean center circumcircle make center encircle always concentric center circle oh let name polygon b c let length sides equal remember first find five triangle equal congruent multiply area one triangle five get area pentagon let length sides equal awe focus ing triangle triangle find area triangle also need height height look height p think moment radius circle cal led inradius let length radius r length pie equal r thing necessary find area triangle bit find area triangle oh equal know area triangle given half base height bases unit sand height area equal half guess area every triangle height triangle r inradius base triangle length side pentagon since five triangle pentagon total area equal five half ar cut area pentagon term sides radius fact formula generalized n polygon total area equal n half ar want calculate area regular hexagon would substitute six place n regular octagon eight area regular polygon pentagon term inradius area regular polygon pentagon term inradius area regular polygon pentagon term inradius
