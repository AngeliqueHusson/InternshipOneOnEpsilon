hi video going write triangle congruence statement sometimes something student lot trouble theyre working proving triangle congruent want want match corresponding sides corresponding angle want triangle congruent want write statement thats going talk video gon na go let jump example gon na try show congruent want look hint see represent parallel ill sometimes ill extend know little bit like sook ay ill extend transversal little bit like able see youve got two cut transversal know previous chapter alternate congruent parallel case see angle angle congruent also know segment bis two triangle going congruent reflexive property going mark prove two triangle side angle side see angle two know congruent sides triangle see two congruent sides nowheres key proving congruent let go ahead write triangle congruence statement triangle blank congruent triangle blank like little strategy see theres one mark one hash mark one theres two theres none ill trace triangle say c b back c goes one zero see write triangle let see weve got c b c b went one zero going pattern go one zero got b back b another way take look say well first second c congruent first second thats congruent b one marking could say second third match see thats true weve got first third c b congruent ad let see right yep c b match es ad thats another way like trace know another way could look corresponding match see taking triangle actually rotating degree bottom triangle corresponding part match let go next example example b trying prove two triangle sare congruent see share wy two triangle going put mark two triangle see congruent angle side angle sine angle particular case one rotation one actually like write triangle congruence statement triangle blank congruent triangle blank gon na go like going go angle one marking side angle two following pattern w z back w w z triangle see got one marking back thing go side angle around like got w x thats one way approach another way approach see fold see w match es see w w z matching x third last example weve got two triangle see right angle must also right angle form linear pair straight line see hypotenuse congruent thats side thats across right angle also know angle angle marked angle angle side angle angle side triangle congruent angle angle side know triangle congruence state thats going look something like want make sure match corresponding sides corresponding angle let way let triangle b e theres one way write want make sure theyre corresponding part match b e went right angle angle marking right want thing right angle one marking marking thats going know corresponding part matching triangle congruence statement could write number ways like could say let way ae b c going congruent c b right thats another way write could write else say know e b second third first c b second third first want make sure corresponding part match whichever method demonstrate know works best stick method know switch easily different technique hope understand work writing trial better subscribe channel check math math tutor look forward seeing future video ill talk soon
