welcome another one math really cool problem power exponential growth see earth moon distance earth moon kilometer earth piece paper atypical piece paper drawn scale thickness typical piece paper millimeter question brain teaser many times need fold piece paper becomes reach moon thickness paper assume fold piece paper many times would like even though world record folding piece paper think times assume fold many times want many fold would take thickness piece paper reach moon decided make brain teaser multiple choice need fold paper b times c million times billion times take time think problem want pause video dont want see solution let start looking side view piece paper drawn scale know piece paper thick every time fold going double thickness one fold going point thick two fold going point four millimeter thick three fold going point eight millimeter thick think get idea going speed process bit double thickness every single fold ten fold paper going thickness ten point compare distance moon still even close original thickness paper actually thousand millimeter basically millimeter times two tenth power fold paper twenty times going power times thick er point five times thick er original piece paper looking outer space paper going get noticeably thick fold going hundred ten thousand think hundred ten billion millimeter think one point one trillion times thick er original piece paper already thick doubling every time fold must really close two hundred twenty forty two fold well moon four hundred forty thousand kilometer thick let know thought brain comment blow mind knowing piece paper needs folded times reach moon think boring easy let know hope see next video
