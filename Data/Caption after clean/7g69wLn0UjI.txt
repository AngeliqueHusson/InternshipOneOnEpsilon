find surface area cuboid three dimensional shape scalled cuboid bounded sides important thing know cuboid defined length breadth height call l b h respectively need understand surface area calculated surface area sum six look rectangle closely area rectangle see front l h area rectangle back also l h sum two l h l h let remove two area rectangle bottom l b length x breadth area rectangle top also bottom sum plus l b let us take two side covered front back top bottom remains sum sides b h area rectangle base x height look group l b cuboid l b h surface area equal l h plus l b plus b h common factor term write l h plus l b plus b h thats simple concept surface area need look surface individually add surface within surface area concept lateral surface area remember one simple thing lateral mean side would actually mean surface area sides four rectangle one one one one back term surface area also look lateral everything except top bottom two green two make lateral surface lateral surface area equal sum sum would b h plus b h sum red rectangle l h l h total lateral surface area twice l h plus b h use concept lateral surface area one application want exterior house painted paint surface paint sides roof
