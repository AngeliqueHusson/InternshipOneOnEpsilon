video want explain difference factorial permutation choose take look calculator find place see n exclamation n factorial see video going show use buttons cant find buttons calculator might want get better one let start n factorial really easy example let say like three different colored want arrange row could arrange blue one first purple red could keep blue one first swap two like could put red one first option well option finally could put purple one first option well option several ways let count ways arrange three think first position position third position hold first marker marker third marker three choice want first position soon make choice going two remain ing let say red next position one left pretty straightforward see three choice first position times two choice second position times one choice remain ing last position write three factorial check let see works three select n factorial well dont want four use shift function push get immediately answer six know three factorial times three times two times one head ten object want arrange possible way want know many ways thats factorial would write would say number ways arrange object sis factorial equal times times times times times times times dont really want type calculator thats factorial button type going touse shift factorial thats answer number ways arrange different object row let say object dont care ar ranging maybe book want put book onto bookshelf might want know many ways could let say book want onto bookshelf well really similar kind problem going book going end choice book right first position going choice youve used one book book left choose next position youve used another book choice finally choice would number ways arrange four object collection object might wonder know let think easy example like going breakfast let say four type bread jam want make toast jam first going choose bread use going choose jam use four choice first task going follow next task basically could think decision tree going decide one four option youve made one choice decide type jam total number times need perform two task general many task series task need figure many ways multiply number ways first number ways task let take example ar ranging three know answer three factorial little bit one three thing go first position next task ha sa different number choice need look given information task number one choice number two thats theres two choice next one one choice final one little bit different toast would choose rye bread choose strawberry jam dont two choice take look ten object sand want order four know number ways ten times nine times eight times seven little bit like factorial right like pattern stopped point stopped got seven didnt continue six five four three two one didnt wan ted directly calculator would would ten permute four calculator mean say trying would like arrange four object youd like know many ways ten object want arrange four care order need use p button p r use shift get p notice tell thats tell r r answer double check let make sure get five thousand forty way know correct ten times nine times eight correct type ten permute four calculator give answer ten times nine times eight times seven course give full product think actually sofar written times times times times times times times written obviously know thats answer answer divide piece doesnt make sense piece thats piece dont care care well let say arrange figure number ways arrange object thats worried first number ways arrange last part necessary dont need worry last six divide divide done times times times times ill use different color right let write factorial divided minus thats exactly factorial divided factorial way remember general n object trying permute r way permute mean select order answer n factorial divided n minus r factorial hopefully understand n factorial mean also n permute mean guy choose r different figure written definition n factorial remember number ways permute order n object row thing except want order r r less equal n let think would happen object people thing whatever let object want select four dont care order example maybe book son shelf maybe people select ing committee doesnt matter pick al ice bob bob al ice theyre going end committee sort ways come equivalent dont care order well think let say going pick order would like n p r case p example looking number ways select select mean order doesnt matter object collection starting saying p p thats going give us number ways select four thing four object order ing object severy different order ing want divide manyways arrange four people whats thats factorial get factorial divided factorial definition p divide factorial weve picked people different divide arrange people thats difference p r mean order thats going get p r c r without order ing thats going get type calculator see last example ten people want choose four dont care order choose going select shift get choose function four equal notice ways choose people fact took number ways choose four people number ways arrange four people would times factorial get back number ways choose range choose arrange p type calculator really choose counting number ways select object group maybe people goon committee want know many possible ways committee built theres member committee answer c see next time could two power possible sequence
