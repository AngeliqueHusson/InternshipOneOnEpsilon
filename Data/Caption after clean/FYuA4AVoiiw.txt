let see construct angle let initial arm angle beer compass point b choose convenient width maybe little half length draw point b r point change width compass take compass point make first say arc intersect point get terminal arm need join point b get r aba terminal arm angle formed angle degree construction really simple made arc without width compass kept made arc intersect ing previous one got construct degree angle construct degree angle construct degree angle
