welcome new planet school going little trigonometry video going focus ona central concept trigonometry cal led unit key concept help us define lot make lots different part trigonometry would consider one important take time well go slowly make sure understand let get star ted unit circle trust understand video definitely understand trigonometry better much see different concept sand trigonometry forth often people want look unit circle memorize certain fact thats great help try understand unit understand trigonometry better understand make much easier memorize anything want memorize unit circle also help remember useful trigonometric relationship write unit circle quickly label bunch point therefore remember bunch different relationship sand finally help graph basic trigonometric function sine cosine tangent easy draw unit circle figure basic figure graph theyre related forth give basically tool help connect concept let get star ted obviously starting unit circle see yellow obviously circle thats pretty simple point go around circle value point point point point notice length origin point circle length obviously length length length forth course thats cal led unit circle lots circle one going talking today unit circle k let stalk definition circle even get trigonometry know circle general know know circle therefore write certain thing point x circle arbitrary point one thing know right away x squared plus squared equal radius squared thats general formula formula circle thats centered origin case unit circle us one thing know x squared plus squared thats radius particular circle simple relationship point check let check point x squared squared plus course equal thing squared plus minus equal check point course also satisfy relationship ever confused find point circle one thing know satisfy particular relationship course definition unit circle one way check want know think want know point know right circle want check make sure sure despise thats definition unit circle something well use good way check work check angle circle coming shortly thats unit circle let talk angle angle sare really important let talk could use degree course remember degree usually term like protractor zero degree degree degree forth obviously got kind cut kept ongoing would get degree go way around circle get degree probably know like understand concept use everyday life probably pretty familiar trigonometry also use something cal led radian probably something familiar probably new concept new way measuring angle following suppose unit circle vary angle right vary angle measure length stop length arc equal radius arc length equal radius angle definition one radian know sort anew concept extremely useful trigonometry even though know might know think term everyday life trust going want understand radio use go back think draw try understand radian mean let give interesting example suppose radius one go around many radian would zero radian go way around many radian sis going talk shortly thats something keep mind many radian go way around would equivalent degree figure review pretty obvious typically measure thing line right well going way would zero obviously perpendicular go way around three quarters around course like around reach degree start zero start forth main angle si need know obviously obvious know halfway instead going around go around let show look like degree draw unit circle degree quickly fill angle forth go around thats label important angle unit circle degree degree let go little bit complicated let give little trick help always remember many radian therearound circle well happen circumference circle pi times radius dont know therefore circle going circumference equal pi times radius unit circle thats circumference pi word distance way around circle distance circumference pi remember definition radian arc length would many radian arc length pi go way around angle go around thing therefore angle automatically know pi fact circumference circle pi r unit circle radian number angle arc length use fact easy way remember know therefore half pi half pi figure way around pi instantly figure relationship trick really really telling us related arc length radian course go quarter way around get angle pi half way go half way get pi quickly draw unit circle remember pi way around figure angle sare radian course useful get piece paper pen pencil draw unit circle next write many degree would really useful way degree radian connected really important trigonometry calculator dont forget select right get wrong answer keep mind handy little tip move trigonometric function snow unit circle weve talking unit circle going going say going notice line going point angle theta going ask point point x word length x height happen know angle could figure x figure really question trigonometry question trigonometric function let see figure least angle imagine ultimate goal might want might like dont want table angle x want able say theta zero pi pi want know want able fill particular value would useful thing able basically angle point question want answer give theta get point vice point get angle figure k way going going define function sine function sine function written way sine function abbreviate si n dont know yet idea trying figure going going define whats cal led opposite hypotenuse let take look going clear going explain precisely remember drawn right right angle therefore whole thing right triangle right triangle thing hypotenuse way label ing triangle right triangle one triangle know case know hypotenuse equal one thats nice thats one nice thing unit circle going going function whatever dont know figure say sine angle equal opposite notice equal divided hypotenuse went opposite hypotenuse height divided hypotenuse one unit circle anything divided one see basically height given sine theta let clear let write wan ted theta x know whatever yis definition sine theta dont know yet whatever function give know angle think way theta stick box something cal led sine function return unit circle value similarly thing cosine go argument cosine adjacent divided hypotenuse angle adjacent equal obviously x divided hypotenuse equal one end relationship cosine theta equal x thing theta stick machine take cosine cosine function always give x still dont know probably touse calculator something function give angle give give angle give x sine function get cosine function get x able connect angle angle right point definition point tangent right simply defined sine cosine x work also opposite adjacent let clear clean clean little bit tangent function tangent theta opposite equal divided adjacent equal x length divided length see sine divided cosine happen want quantity would use calculator look tangent function would give angle would tangent function tangent function calculator would cal led return particular value relate main point go angle point atrial right triangle let label cosine tangent see written sine theta sine theta cosine theta remember youve drawn unit circle right triangle going simple pneumonic cal led something remember say kind funny name maybe ounds like somebody name remember sine opposite hypotenuse thats cosine adjacent hypotenuse let write didnt actually write tangent opposite adjacent opposite adjacent remember relationship cosine relationship tangent thats little trick figure main point simply related unit circle get angle value require function typically use calculator figure thats whole let move let take little break lot learn probably good take little break dont usually break video think time theres theres lot learn take break going going something really easy kind complicated probably want watch several times going saying really easy going equal clear head sand something easy well going little break plus equal probably complicated way imagine given thing already know k going going relationship actually going plus equal going plus equal plus equal plus might well go ahead plus equal simple arithmetic going complicated way going note number x take square root square get x back actually take put square root square havent done anything write way look complicated done absolutely nothing messy k next thing say know dont clean right hand side going clean going going take number gon na divide number going divide number anybody clean little bit write lower left corner nice set right left hand side something thats messy messy thats wan ted figure messy way write relationship think going even make little bit simpler typically write type people tend like square root denominator move multiplying bottom square root get relationship allow radical guy combine let see like final relationship beautiful one plus one equal two one plus three equal four three plus four written beautiful notice two two two two two two two equal symmetry square root square root important thing note kind interesting notice form take form number squared plus number squared equal thats kind interesting thing something fun little break k back trigonometry arithmetic sort interesting way write thing complicated let get back one figure trigonometry told bunch really interesting triangle important thing sand unit circle great way understand let show unit circle connected going help really know everything need know unit circle let try connect several first thing theorem havent seen yet going tell later actually video theorem prove forth today dont really care came say aright triangle one sides squared let suppose triangle say band say c moment general plus b squared equal c squared thats always true right triangle thats taught us interesting thing thats thats general thing talk unit circle right let talk unit circle learn unit circle remember said ear lier point circle circle obey relationship unit circle case equal describe unit circle point x yellow circle obey well equation look heck lot like equation right reason point part triangle tell us suppose want generate value along circle like example point right point point would figure one way figure know unit circle also always right triangle always make right triangle anywhere want therefore always use theorem fact theorem normally think associated right triangle didnt know time see theorem video know thing unit circle triangle em bedded circle therefore circle triangle intimately related allow us generate useful point circle know circle satisfy x squared plus squared equal let clean let look right general equation circle unit circle know position relate arithmetic break notice little break bunch equation exactly form exactly form must legitimate x must legitimate lie circle therefore x x x satisfy unit circle relationship point simply arithmetic plus equal break way generate point circle see look like point arithmetic break lie unit circle follow form x squared plus squared equal need let take point right halfway zero pi two zero halfway one thing automatically know x value must value notice point therefore pi four half pi two must value one thats halfway pi four halfway therefore equal equal equal notice one came relationship let clean go one one see value right came x one right came equation know generate simply know circle addition know star ted wasnt interesting start fill lot point circle nowheres amazing thing clean go look notice recall number plus minus squared doesnt anything put minus x wouldnt anything similarly could put minus wouldnt anything plus minus x plus wouldnt change anything generate point along circle example perfectly legitimate point right minus square root square root essentially mirror image point put minus sign still equation circle must somewhere similarly pick point put sign front value sort mirror point one wont draw mirror mirror mirror forth mean understand remember remember put plus minus minus plus plus minus minus minus plus plus generate three three three knowing value remember value came simply little arithmetic break square give us one would tell us lie unit circle useful way remember get interesting thing let clean remember notice way notice triangle right x value square root three two value look triangle triangle exactly opposite x value value square root three two two triangle triangle triangle therefore triangle triangle prove wont prove hereright trust prove triangle related two triangle way prove angle angle divide let let use want use let use degree right divided three must must see actually prove proving see breaking angle three therefore point must lie point halfway must degree point right lie degree see argument comes due description theyre em bedded unit circle able sit around sit piece paper pencil kind come upwith thats really understand unit circle nothing memorize course youve gone really understand probably end memorize try sit bet memorize dont know reconstruct let look angle know point point point mirror going draw drew know angle must divide either angle half course know whats going whats cal led quadrant continue around angle really important really amazing may obvious really amazing guess figured something well figured remember sine sine theta equal opposite hypotenuse unit circle thats opposite one angle opposite angle value figure outby simple argument figured sine example pi lower one equal amazing figured actually starting able imagine goal theta want figure x need function take angle x function trigonometric function sine cosine tangent figured one value figured something sine function actually thats pretty amazing let continue move dit little bit continue argument way around circle figure rule value circle know point occur start knowing lot cosine whole bunch different relationship theyre associated let move look graph let look let carefully imagine angle thats want know graph know point let see figure graph would look like remember sine theta equal value height right right triangle theta clearly dont really triangle sine theta would value would would point right oh sorry would point right sorry kind confuse point right go around clearly value get go around finally value equal would degree would degree would degree sand go around past degree value less height go back like go around circle eventually come right back star ted go way around repeat sine sine function periodic important function periodic function let cosine cosine thing actually let clear cosine thing theta zero code dont really triangle look like obviously cosine equal x value one go around x value let draw tall one shrinking eventually go towards degree x value degree degree degree sat zero keep going also cosine also periodic function go way around circle degree cosine also periodic also periodic function see sort amazing draw unit circle remember cosine want adjacent hypotenuse sine defined value unit circle opposite hypotenuse simply draw different point think x value go point point round end able generate point along circle p one previous actually also knew going degree would actually fill two continued sort thing would get function look like famous sine function cosine function look like could go every single little point run around circle would end graph look like ever want memorize graph look like maybe want remember one start zero one hit zero hit one really simple long remember picture simply draw picture generate easily tangent way dont show remember tangent function sine theta cosine theta similar property plot well let actually show like happen san animation sine cosine tangent function plotted see go go around twice go around two pi two pi point final point right pi go way around see keep mind right arent really part tangent function theyre way graph ing program goes discontinuously goes reason kind like know sine theta cosine theta obviously look point cosine theta zero sine theta zero large number negative goes positive side thats tangent function particular shape summary unit circle great way understand triangle connected circle great way motivate sine cosine function sand weve kind used actually define comes natural way easy way understand easy way remember refer get use sine opposite hypotenuse cosine adjacent tangent opposite adjacent course general let tell general whereas unit circle little bit simpler well get later one keep mind general relationship define sine cosine tangent term unit circle worth still remember ing always going also connected theorem basically made connection something normally associate triangle circle basically unit circle embed triangle make connection us generate point unit circle obey plus b squared equal c squared talk lot later wanting make connection even havent seen unit circle allow us display point son circle angle point drew unit circle figured lot point went around root comma square root generate value check way obey example x squared plus squared equal like square root square root one point square two divided square squared divided course add legitimate point circle interesting way generate draw unit circle able easy plot draw circle go around go around know value point know generate cosine forth really important many application math engineering physics chemistry fact important fact trigonometric function fact term use trigonometric function often used without reference triangle without reference circle even theyre used understand periodic function periodic like light wave sound wave thats important thing remember function periodic sine cosine definitely next watch new planet cool video getting gory detail trigonometric function go back watch remember worth remember ing trigonometry interesting important secondly watch video draw unit circle go web find empty unit circle look like unit circle blank print go fill definitely able memorize unit circle able print one simply know fill better would really watch video remember generate point put put around go web see find blank unit circle empty unit circle try fill thing might want watch new planet video remember triangle weve video theres lot obtuse triangle acute triangle isosceles triangle keep mind theres lot different type triangle lot different really havent lied next obvious one know sine next thing go watch new planet school video sine cosine tangent instead term unit circle really dig think lot detail mean solve triangle swith sort core example trigonometry class useful obvious video next thank new planet school hope see back another video soon
