today want share neat way solve puzzle counting different number system surprisingly stuff finding curve fill triangle learned former c lecturer mine name schwarz got say man one best educator ever actually corded bit conversation sho wed stuff guy hear describe directly weird normally sort person like little puzzle love looking analysis puzzle game sand love looking mathematical pattern ask come case arent lay puzzle actually collection three peg disc descending size think disk hole middle fit onto peg set pictured five disc ill label principle could many disc want start biggest one spindle goal move entire tower one spindle another rule move one disc time cant move bigger disc top smaller disk example first move must involve moving disk disk stuff top needs get way move move disc go whatever peg doesnt currently disk otherwise bigger disk smaller one youve never seen highly encourage pause pull book vary ing try kind get feel puzzle hard hard kind stuff sho wed something truly surprising puzzle solve counting binary rhythm counting certain rhythm disc anyone unfamiliar going take moment quick overview first actually even familiar binary want explain focus rhythm counting may may thought description binary typically start introspection usual way represent call since use ten separate rhythm counting begin walking ten run new express next number ten two say one place since meant encapsulate group youve already far freeing place reset zero rhythm counting like counting nine rolling place counting nine rolling place process nine times roll hundred place digital keep track many group youve hit freeing two reset zero way rhythm counting kind zoom scale process look like something rolling thing rolling repeat nine times even roll binary also known limit two cal led short binary result counting roll time counting youve already run need roll two place writing resisting every urge brain read ten instead understand mean one group plus increment represent three already roll since theres one two place roll well giving represent one group four plus group two plus way represent base two represent different instead talking place hundred place thousand place thing like talk two place place eight rhythm counting lot faster almost make noticeable flip last roll flip last roll twice flip last roll flip last roll three times theres certain self similarity every scale process something roll thing small scale say counting three binary mean flip last bit roll flip last bit scale like counting fifteen binary process let last three count seven roll eight let last three count counting eight successive look like let ting last seven count till theyre full rolling let ting last seven count alright introduction surprising fact sho wed use rhythm solve start counting zero whenever last bit disc one peg right already rightmost peg loop back first peg binary counting roll two place meaning flip last two move disc number move might ask well choice cant put top disk theres one peg move forced move counting involve last bit move disk binary counting roll twice place move disc number pattern continue like flip last move disk flip last move disc last move disk gon na roll three times eight place correspond moving disc number something magical like first saw like cant work dont know works dont know know magical see remember together animation teaching like know know works know thing still fun sit like know watch play oh mean even clear first always going give legal example know every time rolling eight disc necessarily going freed move time solution immediately raise question like come work better way step sit turns solve efficient way possible understanding works works heck going certain perspective puzzle c folk might call recursive perspective disc thinking get cant really function much weight pressure disc perspective want figure disc going get somehow dont care disc get spindle b thats way move top cant move spindle c cant move somehow get done move disc disc say set never need move everyone else figure get sense smaller version problem youve got disc sitting spindle b got ta get c idea focus one think going get disc work turn bigger problem something slightly smaller solve well exactly thing disc going say disc disc need know need space get need move somewhere disc move needs disc interesting point every single disc pretty much exact strategy say everybody get going everyone come back know insight code something solve think five six code probably highest ratio intellectual investment code think becomes clear efficient solution every step forced upon get disc move disc move disc three move disk back theres room inefficiency perspective counting binary capture algorithm well whats going pattern subproblem moving big disk subproblem perfectly pattern binary counting count amount roll count amount algorithm binary counting self similar sense zoom count power solve still structure subproblem thing subproblem example pretty small scale two disc move disc move disc reflected counting three binary flip last bit roll flip last bit slightly scale three disc look like whatever take solve two disc move disc number whatever take solve two disc analogously counting binary involve counting three rolling three counting three scales process es breakdown sense reason binary solution least explanation feel like theres one explanation think natural one pattern would use generate binary exactly structure pattern would use look effectively reversing saying process like trying understand give effectively reverse engineering recursive algorithm tower works thats pretty cool right actually get cooler havent even gotten triangle thats exactly going following video part thanks everybody supporting video finished first chapter essence calculus working second one right getting early access publish full series video next one also sup ported
