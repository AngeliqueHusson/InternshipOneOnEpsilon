k learning dirt good youve probably hear theorem part crazy cult leader thought deal god thousand year ago could remember past live soh kil led guy mean maybe long time ago afraid bean like something dont know mostly want talk murder part see cult club proportion like hey drew two three rectangle straightedge awesome someone would like hey guy box thats two three half cool would like three half thats number get club make half length call four seven everything oka yeven box divide thousandth sand youd get box thats nice simple proportion hey box still whole number proportion happy unless box bean freak id like imagine would like think way maybe think one way zero negative rational filling didnt think werent point continuum separate still pretty modern people thought world number seven eight number three two much relationship three two proportion six four relationship share evenness make three two universe made relationship mathematics wasnt people admire much proportion theres dark flip side obsession far willing go protect proportion kill would die answer go pretty far bean got involved time time line like line si want context school today bring ruler compass like let draw two degree straightedge happy square youve probably year math class already think geometry harder big together probably think zero simple easy concept hear decimal well newton da sure let go way back numeral brought west arithmetic nightmarishly hard multiply together go back time impress bean concept zero except zero discovered around keep going back get year one theres year zero course zero back bit get folk finally way back century pretty cool mathematics without good handle arithmetic people long time school tell need memorize multiplication table graph parabola learn real mathematics lying time equation formula like see theorem wasnt squared plus b squared equal c square leg right triangle area square hypotenuse written said square meant square one leg square plus leg hypotenuse square three literally squared plus four made square two square area five five square cut nine square sixteen fit together square way cut hypotenuse square sand fit two leg thought could trick right triangle matter many piece cut side relationship length one side length another wan ted find map trouble right triangle one leg length one leg square equal leg one hypotenuse something two whats square root two make whole number ratio square root two close would whole number ratio squared plus squared definitely squared ratio even closer ratio close indeed still exact wan ted find perfect ratio knew must exist meanwhile someone brotherhood proved wasnt ratio square root two irrational decimal notation decimal notation go forever usually proof given algebraically something like pretty simple beautiful know algebra didnt like imagine thought proof algebra like theres totally ratio make whole number sand guy like fine theres whole number ratio square plus square square yeah thats made yeah though triangle dont even need full theorem easy see cutting part four dont want divide square triangle want unit kind like square divided one fit perfectly one vice like almost works start dividing square evenly fill two equal square youve got one odd one theres odd number square begin cant divide evenly two even right triangle whats point know odd number like gon na without even trying odd number times give odd number square whatever number cant seven hypotenuse even thats fine proved leg even ratio even divide two cant divide one ratio best thought assumed talking form ratio theres ratio form odd since hypotenuse divisible two leg must odd one proved leg even proved cant unless doesnt exist forget square two sides center divisible way number square side number square one leg even number number square even number oh brother leg squared even leg even cant even already odd unless doesnt exist theyre even divide two start still even mean still even divide two everything even forever never find perfect ratio aw w bean vision beautiful vision world made relationship wasnt whole number ratio still believe wan ted believe irrationality somehow false world wan ted proof stayed secret someone pilled guy name threw boat drown punishment ruin ing perfector maybe someone else discovered someone else long dead maybe got exile know sand die well according one guy guy got mad didnt get cool club set house fire running away chasing came upon field field field bean sand turned around face pursuer sand better trample bean sand say ran starved death got caught ran around bean field instead know people claim like bean thought bad digestion gave bad minded male genitalia didnt want clubhouse full mathematician didnt like metaphorically werent vegetarian didnt sacrifice eat certain colors bird si mean definitely lot rule follow meant lost history id like give colorful story exactly somehow kind truth doesnt last know square root two irrational theres way length side square diagonal whole truth truth proof good year ago mean awesome show theres world whole shame didnt bean admit
