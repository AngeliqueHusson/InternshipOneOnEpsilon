introduction geometry level video going naming angle various point geometric figure let go ahead jump straight first following figure find following name angle possible ways following figure type quadrilateral since formed sides oppose toa triangle formed sides study quadrilateral much later video problem us name angle possible first figure angle figure first locate point move towards point p move towards point r way angle know vertex angle point p formed p r angle question would following angle might use vertex p name angle angle p unfortunately would incorrect since point p also vertex another angle specifically one name angle angle p since point also vertex another angle would someone trying locate angle effort avoid confusion need name angle ways one alternative way name angle reversing order point name angle r po making sure denote vertex p middle yet another way name angle point since line contain ing point p name angle angle angle making sure denote vertex p middle notice figure use label angle result essentially done possible ways name particular angle alright let try next example vertex angle remember vertex angle denote din particular way middle letter case vertex angle point figure left location ray intersect also think vertex intersection two ray notation denote ray ray os cover problem set notation later video let move along next example many angle vertex point r first let locate point r point r bottom right corner figure notice point vertex three distinct angle first angle name das angle pro angle p angle angle second angle name angle angle angle angle third final angle name das angle angle total angle point r vertex alright let try next example name angle possible way sok let first identify angle problem let start point move towards point move towards point p angle reference problem one way name angle switching direction point sand name angle pst addition also use point name angle since line contain point p point name angle angle angle since figure use label angle essentially possible ways name angle alright let try final example many triangle figure first glance seem figure include triangle left name triangle top triangle right name triangle triangle top name triangle triangle bottom name triangle turns actually triangle smaller triangle first one name triangle next one name triangle another one name triangle name triangle total triangle figure alright next video continue naming point geometric figure geometry introduction geometry level naming angle geometry introduction geometry level naming angle geometry introduction geometry level naming angle
