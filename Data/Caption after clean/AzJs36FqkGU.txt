hey everybody thank stopping byon lesson gon na take quick visual conceptual journey relationship isosceles triangle let go ahead get everyone thanks joining lesson gon na explore isosceles triangle let start outwith basic definition say triangle two congruent sides scalled isosceles could look visual example pair congruent sides little sides congruent example isosceles triangle orientation may different kind rotated different way actually make difference let go ahead take step gon na spin around three isosceles triangle facing way congruent sides spot let go ahead look isosceles marking angle theres important relationship want see imagine vertically cut triangle sin half right middle result would right triangle like shown take right triangle reflect vertical line imagine cutting half originally result would original isosceles triangle oh cool revisit relationship later lesson right keep building concept exactly triangle ready first isosceles triangle theorem say two sides triangle congruent also congruent first part theorem say two sides triangle congruent case going say side b congruent size c angle opposite sides congruent actually mean two congruent sides go opposite across arrive atangle b c according theorem angle b would congruent angle c since opposite sides congruent obviously triangle take really good look image classic representation typical isosceles triangle two sides congruent two angle opposite sides also congruent keeping relationship mind help us better identify isosceles triangle future next isosceles triangle theorem going look say triangle congruent sides opposite also congruent kind like theorem two angle triangle congruent case angle b congruent angle c sides opposite angle also congruent would mean side b would tobe congruent side c thats pretty much theorem works relationship conclude triangle loo ked two important isosceles triangle theorem visually compare two understand difference theorem one said two sides triangle congruent opposite also congruent theorem two said triangle congruent two sides opposite also congruent like reverse order two comfortable basic definition image typical isosceles triangle let look else know triangle going go back right triangle relationship loo ked isosceles triangle two congruent kind back reflected vertical line since triangle congruent know corresponding angle corresponding sides also congruent see definition isosceles triangle mind one step say altitude base isosceles triangle bisect vertex angle visualize mean call triangle triangle e f draw altitude angle base triangle make anew point cal led g say vertex angle cut two congruent halves triangle isosceles altitude g conclusion f g congruent altitude vertex angle two anything else say isosceles triangle relationship turns altitude g bisect vertex angle base line cut base big line fe two congruent halves conclude f g would congruent toe g based relationship think term two congruent right triangle know bases going make sense correspond conceptual understanding isosceles triangle relationship angle sides better understand isosceles triangle thought explain notan equilateral triangle isosceles triangle think share response comment id love hear guy say thank stopping ill see soon thats hope guy please click link subscribe channel got ton math know learn one topic math class dont need help dont forget subscribe support
