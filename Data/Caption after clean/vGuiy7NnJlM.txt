whats everyone welcome lesson going explore different triangle congruence let start question congruence even mean like think equal sign squiggly line take moment really conceptualize congruence term figure running shoe somehow duplicate running would make exact replica would say congruent exactly size shape even change color one rotate around certain number degree still congruent original sneaker size shape want extend kind thinking triangle see whether congruent corresponding sides angle measure say congruent figure dont orientation visually easy tell whether congruent theorem going come play goal lesson help understand use prove congruence know theorem use particular situation five triangle theorem side side angle side angle side angle angle angle side hypotenuse leg ready go ahead explore theorem individually side triangle congruence theorem two triangle corresponding sides congruent mean length thats enough information say congruent mean exactly size shape instance use theorem conclude triangle congruent corresponding sides corresponding angle measure remember relationship still true even different orientation next theorem triangle congruence theorem pair corresponding congruent sides two triangle pair corresponding congruent another set corresponding sides congruent see letter two name theorem correspond congruent angle two congruent sides case enough information say congruent theorem next congruence theorem angle side angle theorem pair corresponding congruent angle pair corresponding congruent sides another pair corresponding congruent angle enough information prove angle side angle important notice congruent side two visualize case enough information prove congruent angle side angle mean corresponding sides measure next theorem similar one loo ked angle side angle one angle side pair corresponding congruent angle along second pair corresponding congruent angle well pair corresponding congruent sides dont want confuse last theorem angle side angle theorem angle side involve two congruent angle one congruent side difference angle angle side congruent angle sare consecutive one congruent side next setup even though order different still enough information prove congruent corresponding sides corresponding angle measure final congruence theorem kind special case leg let start key feature right triangle right angle know hypotenuse right triangle longe st side always opposite right angle congruence theorem say hypotenuse right triangle congruent leg one sides congruent pair corresponding congruent sides enough say two triangle congruent mean sides measure weve covered five triangle congruence theorem may angle side side please dont tight let go ahead explore angle side side would work triangle congruence theorem set corresponding angle congruent set corresponding sides congruent two angle two consecutive congruent sides issue second congruent side since dont know angle two congruent sides dont exactly know position could take side swing new location still show angle side side still case matter choose second triangle option drawing either way since thats isosceles triangle sides definitely congruent draw way acute triangle see angle side side however base triangle clearly clearly congruent thank much guy check ing us please subscribe free animated update every week
