right video gon na talk finding common factor usually abbreviate oftentimes gon na common factor basic idea need make sense basically exponent common factor along factor well loo ked least common multiple video made basically similar idea little little different case want find common factor know arithmetic pretty good probably know figure pretty quickly gon na kind long way long way gon na works complicated expression kind looking procedure start easy want need factor number notice write actually times break break well actually break even times forget next example well times write squared ca n really anything else kind leave alone well write times everything got original times notice multiply get back well likewise write times find common factor start basically look first thing say well got two first part two well well yes two first part exponent second power exponent two take factor pull exponent pull first look next number say well well think three well well part third part n excuse exponent mean pull first done mean notice left first part factor times equivalently think biggest number goes bigger number maybe arithmetic get little hard know arithmetic little harder gon na thing gon na start factor ing well even write times also even least write original first part break times original two break times point stop turns actually prime number ca n break even could broken really irrelevant however split going get new factor common could write squared times squared times thing find common factor think well common also pull smaller exponent well theyre power pull squared n factor basically done point say common factor simply number pretty big like intuitively something bigger goes turns factor let step couple case got variable idea exactly k part look first got x squared z fourth one term got x fourth e squared another fifth basically first one say x hey x second one also x third one well x power three second one sa power power mean si keep power pull x third power next part see second term pull include common factor notice thing z well z first one z second one last one turns original three expression x cube dis going common factor hey well thrown well going factor eight actually factor times times cube going leave x squared alone rewrite times times x fifth still hanging gon na thing write times well squared squared x first fourth n know able jump factorization certainly know write trying save us little bit time couple example look first one see second one last one pull power notice two two mean factor going involve two squared look next one well x first one x second one x third one look got pull power gon na pull x idea look second one third one look power three power five power four mean pull power three gon na also third common factor four times x times third see ca n another couple real quick idea thing parenthesis idea got x plus two third x fourth x minus x plus squared x minus play game see x plus first part see x plus part look third power common factor x plus power see x raised power notice second part simply x raised ca n pull x next part see x minus oh x minus one well see power see power got pull power pull minus common factor let one x squared minus x squared plus plus problem basic idea example sis already well factor x squared minus x plus x minus factor x squared plus plus plus x plus back example like see x plus mean factor x plus see x minus x gon na common factor simply x right hope basic hope n step last quickly feel free look web site need see least common multiple stuff want see example let know happy try get finding common factor finding common factor finding common factor
