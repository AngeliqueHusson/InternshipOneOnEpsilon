right video gon na talk finding common factor usually abbreviate oftentimes gon na common factor basic idea need well make sense basically exponent common factor along factor well youve loo ked least common multiple video made basically similar idea little little different case want find common factor know arithmetic pretty good probably know figure pretty quickly gon na kind long way long way gon na works complicated expression kind looking procedure well start easy want need factor number notice write actually times break break well actually break even times forget next example well times write squared cant really anything else kind leave alone well write times everything got original times notice multiply get back well likewise write times find common factor start basically look first thing say got two first part two well well yes two first part exponent second power exponent two take factor pull exponent pull first look next number say well well think three well well theres part theres third part didnt excuse theyre exponent mean pull first done mean notice theres left theres first part factor times equivalently think biggest number goes bigger number maybe arithmetic get little hard know arithmetic little harder gon na thing gon na start factor ing well even write times also even least write original first part break thats times original two break times point stop turns actually prime number cant break even could broken really irrelevant however split going get new factor common could write squared times squared times thing find common factor think well theres common theres also pull smaller exponent well theyre power pull squared doesnt factor basically done point say common factor simply number pretty big like intuitively something bigger goes turns factor let step couple case weve got variable idea exactly k part look first got x squared z fourth thats one term got x fourth e squared thats another fifth basically first one say x hey theres x second one theres also x third one well x power three second one sa power power mean si keep power pull x third power next part see theres second term theres theres pull include common factor notice thing z well theres z first one theres z second one theres last one turns original three expression x cube dis going common factor hey well thrown well going factor eight actually factor times times cube going leave x squared alone rewrite times thats times x fifth still hanging gon na thing write times well squared squared x first fourth werent know able jump factorization certainly know write trying save us little bit time couple example look first one see theres theres second one theres last one pull power notice two two mean factor going involve two squared look next one well theres x first one theres x second one x third one look got pull power gon na pull x idea look theres second one third one look power three power five power four mean pull power three gon na also third common factor four times x times third see cant another couple real quick idea thing parenthesis idea youve got x plus two third x fourth x minus x plus squared x minus play game see x plus first part see x plus part look third power common factor x plus power see x raised power notice second part theres simply x raised cant pull x next part see x minus oh theres x minus one well see power see power weve got pull power pull minus common factor let one x squared minus x squared plus plus problem basic idea example sis already well factor x squared minus x plus x minus factor x squared plus plus plus x plus back example like see theres x plus mean factor x plus see theres x minus x thats gon na common factor simply x right hope basic hope didnt step last quickly feel free look web site need see least common multiple stuff want see example let know ill happy try get
