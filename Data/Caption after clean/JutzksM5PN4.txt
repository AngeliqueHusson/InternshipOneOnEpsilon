welcome introduction inverse goal video use inverse trig find angle given function value also use inverse solve right triangle remember think function inverse function two function undo illustration see function fand x input output well output f becomes input f inverse f inverse output x see whatever start end two function inverse one way look trig standpoint let f x sin x let inverse inverse say example input degree swell sin degree equal put sin ratio inverse function return angle final result degree inverse function written see inverse sin x also write arc sin x inverse cosine x written arc cosine x inverse tangent x written arc tangent x thing remember inverse input trig function value output angle use inverse trig solve following type calculator find angle theta interval zero equation know sin theta equal goal find angle would give sin value take equation take inverse sin remember two function sare inverse one another undo result would theta left side right side one used seeing regard one reference use graph ing calculator let go ahead get use inverse sin key right sin key press second bring inverse sin function type return angle without sin value roughly plot go ahead try another one theta order find theta take arc tangent inverse tangent two undo result theta find graph ing calculator right tangent arc tangent inverse tangent key press second tangent type angel roughly lot say inverse right going use find angle given trig function value also solve right another example want solve given right triangle centimeter b call angle angle b angle c side across angle need find hypotenuse interior triangle find hypotenuse theorem c squared squared b squared c equal square root go ahead go calculator c approximately centimeter snow need find angle angle b well look angle awe pick three geometric look tangent tangent angle equal ratio opposite side adjacent divided find angle take arc tangent sides left side give us angle find value graph ing calculator second tangent see angle roughly degree snow know two angle b must complementary would give us degree angle band solve right take look one angle three four five right triangle remember three four five one special right never talk angle triangle going figure let go ahead call angle angle band angle c need find angle angle b take look angle aim going go ahead use sin sin angle must equal opposite hypotenuse sin equal order find angle ai take inverse sin sides left side angle right side go calculator want inverse sin second sin look like roughly degree sand two complimentary give us degree angle band triangle discuss much inverse function later right use information solve right triangle si hope found video helpful good day
