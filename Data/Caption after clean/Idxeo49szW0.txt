last video sho wed someone walk ask arc sine whoops arc sine x going equal know thing saying sine angle equal x solve couple case last example pattern let show could also written inverse sine x equal equivalent ways writing inverse sine function inverse sine function taking negative power saying sine question mark angle equal x last video pattern walk street say tangent inverse tangent x equal immediately head say oh saying tangent angle equal x need figure angle let example let say walk street lot walking lot would write say minus could equivalently ked inverse tangent minus equivalent question sand head n memorize draw unit circle actually let refresher tangent even tangent theta straightup vanilla non inverse function tangent equal sine theta cosine theta sine theta value unit function unit circle cosine theta draw line let draw little unit circle unit circle like let say angle let say thats angle theta x know already value sine theta let scroll sine theta already know x value cosine theta tangent going going distance divided distance algebra might ring bell starting origin point change change x rise run kind view tangent theta really slope line slope could write slope equal tangent theta let bear mind go example ill rewrite inverse tangent minus keep writing arc tangent minus saying angle give slope minus unit circle let draw unit circle let draw unit circle like axes like want slope minus slope minus look like like would slope plus angle order slope minus distance distance might already recognize right angle angle triangle isosceles triangle two add know actually n even know sides previous video saw going right distance going square root direction minus square root right x direction square root length right square root squared plus square root squared equal squared important thing realize triangle angle right well looking triangle would say degree angle since going clockwise x axis call minus degree angle tangent minus let write degree sand tend think could write tangent minus degree equal negative value minus square root square root equal minus could write arc tangent minus equal minus degree snow dealing radian convert multiply times get pi radian degree cancel goes four times equal minus sign minus pi arc tangent minus equal minus pi inverse tangent minus also equal minus pi could say look minus pi fine give value minus slope line minus keep going around unit circle could add pi maybe could add pi would also give took tangent angle would also give minus could add pi give minus fact could go point right tangent would also give minus slope right like said sine inverse sine video ca n function many ca n tangent inverse x ca n map bunch different value sit ca n map minus pi ca n map would pi n know would say pi minus pi pi minus pi ca n map different constrict range inverse tan function restrict similarly way restricted sine inverse sine going restrict first fourth answer inverse tangent always going something ca n point point tangent function becomes undefined pi minus pi ever slope goes vertical start dividing change x dividing cosine theta goes divide undefined range let write inverse tangent x going well value tangent take tangent theta equal x different value x could take possible value slope slope take anything x could anywhere minus infinity positive infinity x could pretty much take value theta well said theta go minus pi way pi ca n even include pi minus pi vertical say dealing vanilla tangent inverse domain well domain tangent go multiple times around let make statement want inverse tangent n many want cross going restrict theta range greater minus pi less positive pi restrict range right exclude point point get one answer say tangent give slope minus question right one answer keep one fall obviously go around around fall valid range theta giving kind make sure answer pi see get use calculator inverse tangent minus equal let see thing minus pi pi equal minus pi good solve without calculator hard recognize minus pi inverse trig function arc tan trigonometry khan academy inverse trig function arc tan trigonometry khan academy inverse trig function arc tan trigonometry khan academy
