say type little hill rock formation right able figure know point point along base straight along level ground know steeper side steeper guess surface edge cliff whatever call meter sand longer side guess less steep side able measure wan na use knowledge trigonometry given information figure steep side actual inclination relative level ground another way thinking angle theta right encourage pause video think well might ringing bell well know three sides triangle want figure angle thing jump head well maybe law cosine could useful let write law try apply triangle right law cosine tell c squared equal b squared minus two b times cosine theta remind b c c side thats opposite angle theta draw arbitrary triangle right angle theta c side b could either two sides could one b could one way around see b essentially role formula right could b could wan na somehow relate angle wan na figure theta little hill example right going theta c going well c going meter side could set either one b could say meter sand b meter sand could apply law cosiness law cosine tell equal thats squared plus b squared plus squared minus two times b minus two times times times cosine theta works well us given us everything theres really one unknown theres theta let see solve theta squared squared squared see two times equal let see simplify little bit going equal plus see equal new add two get plus plus plus get minus cosine theta let see sides gon na subtract sides get closer isolating theta let going negative plus yes right right way around minus would positive two course cancel going equal negative times cosine theta divide sides negative gon na swap sides get cosine theta equal see could divide numerator denominator essentially negative going become positive cosine theta equal actually simplified even three goes times yep actually could simplified equal actually didnt simplification step use make math little tractable right goes yeah take inverse cosine sides could get theta equal inverse cosine arc cosine let get calculator see get something make sense wan na inverse cosine deserve drum roll get degree sand already calculator degree mode get wan ted round approximately equal wan na round nearest tenth essentially give us sense steep slope actually
