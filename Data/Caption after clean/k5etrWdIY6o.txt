hi today math antic starting new subject going learn special kind math cal led geometry geometry study thing like angle distance thing like video going focus three basic element part geometry point gon na start point theyre thing imagine geometry whats point let draw little tiny dot space really important job geometry help us describe specific location space like end line corner square center circle wont really help much unless name say hey look point kind hard tell one talking mean look give point swell let beau regard maybe let know second thought kind long complicated dont use first letter name instead say look point look point b know exactly talking fact let let talk point point b minute start point go point b taking shor test distance possible youd gone straight linea line next basic element geometry name line point goes example would call line start point b technically really difference ask thats good question line segment beginning end start one point space end another line hand keep going either direction forever like number line keep going forever well least imagine goes forever actually draw line goes forever instead draw line instead go past end point little bit put arrow end line show keep going line segment b line theres one special type line need talk basically combination line segment call beginning point ending point keep going forever one direction put arrow end keep going call one ray e fin geometry three type shorthand way writing instead writing line segment b write b line instead writing line c write c double arrow line like finally instead writing ray write e f single arrow line like sook ay know point sand know form line two next thing gon na learn kind fly help understand geometry go back look point beginning video look like point depth computer screen right wed say theyre plane thats computer screen plane flat surface like window sheet paper plane flat surface call two dimensional object theres two dimension move go go left right line hand one dimensional object line like line one dimension travel sure go forwards backwards along line still one dimension cant get point c without going line abb ut plane two dimensional object get point c point c plane point ball three flat two dimensional surface computer screen cool mean want get point di plane b c right alright confession make really plane computer look like position watch happen start rotating screen space little bit ah ha see point actually scattered place space point actually front plane b c along point rest point actually behind plane b c three dimensional space space short three dimensional space theres three dimension move left right plane contain point b c cant get point unless leave plane traveling third dimension three dimensional space like often cal led volume well talk volume another video let get back talking video learned make line connect ing two point right well order make plane turns need three three point b c connect b get line connect b c get triangle probably thinking wait thought supposed get plane triangle well flat surface triangle lot like plane three edge sit doesnt keep going forever talking remember line segment end true line kept going forever well kind way triangle cant think triangle smaller part segment plane plane keep going forever three point take define plane space weve looking already plane let try making rest choose three point want let join e f see triangle extend flat triangle see plane try one rest point dont feel left outlet join g h form triangle flat surface form plane extend every direction know basic element geometry theres lot geometry ahead upcoming video stay check exercise section theyre pretty easy theyll help remember youve learned thanks watching ill see next time learn
