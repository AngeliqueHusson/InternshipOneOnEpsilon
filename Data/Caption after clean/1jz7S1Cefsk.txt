polar point continuity derivative integral foundational calculus concept weve working c artesian dont always hear cal led c artesian talking point sin two dimensional space graph system weve got x axis axis point plot axes defined convention example point mean move four along positive direction three along axis positive direction point arrive x convention use location point space way express location point alternately could express location distance away origin angle point giving direction point could telling walk straight left right parallel parallel axis could polar pointing certain direction telling far walk c artesian expressed x polar expressed r theta r distance walk origin radius theta direction angle point converting polar think easily convert c artesian polar simple trigonometry already right triangle call length three sides x r mean use theorem express r term x wed say given c artesian point like point use conversion formula solve r value corresponding polar point keep mind talking distance discount negative value r r value need corresponding value theta well know express c artesian point polar point let talk angle theta given point c artesian already know length opposite adjacent sides triangle generalize well call x remember soh toa trigonometry since tangent angle equal length opposite side divided length adjacent side take inverse tangent sides solve say c artesian point equal polar point know use formula convert c artesian polar polar equation snow let talk convert point c artesian polar also use right triangle write expression x since cosine angle length adjacent side divided length hypotenuse describe relationship r theta x solve equation x thing knowing sine angle theta length opposite side divided length hypotenuse point everything need convert single point polar convert entire function c artesian polar given function term x use substitution formula remove x rep lacing r theta know equation defined polar unit circle move need briefly discuss unit circle make note last example first important us recognize close relationship unit circle polar system remember unit circle give us value angle theta move away counterclockwise direction conveniently angle match angle define polar system given polar point angle take us degree sand radius unit circle constantly find value theta polar negative value polar note last example said could ignore negative value r could say r instead even though r theta assume negative value polar want deal entirely positive always four ways arrive polar point example want plot polar point already know angle move distance origin plot point could instead find angle move opposite direction distance origin move clockwise instead counterclockwise find theta angle move origin distance moving clockwise negative theta direction take angle move distance origin mean four polar point weve listed point space given point could decide wed rather deal instead call point use polar might wondering would want use polar working well well lots function much easier express polar c artesian example think equation circle know today equation circle radius describe term x look like describe term polar equation exact circle thats better think circle sphere much easier describe polar c artesian convenient understand polar able work need
