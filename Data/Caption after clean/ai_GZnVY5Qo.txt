order find area regular polygon first need inscribe inside circle apothem definition apothem perpendicular segment center sides polygon back whats center well center polygon center circumscribe polygon notice draw radius center vertex also radius circle zoom whats going apothem perpendicular segment center sides vert polygon draw two radii since radius circle constant isosceles triangle whenever draw apothem vertices going create isosceles triangle one property isosceles triangle altitude vertex angle remember apothem bisect two congruent base angle specifically hexagon since six radii going degree six ways mean angle going since two base angle sare congruent going equilateral triangle works hexagon remember drawing radii six doesnt give us formula going going think triangle let say knew length base also going side length going call calculate area triangle saying apothem height triangle times base dividing half thats definition area triangle base type question many triangle going well case hexagon going six triangle would multiply six going going generalize formula say instead writing six hexagon going write n ann sided polygon formula work regular polygon equilateral equiangular area formula going area going apothem times side length times number sides divided two calculating area one triangle multiplying however many
