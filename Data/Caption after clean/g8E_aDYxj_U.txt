right four thats gon na binomial statistics pretty interesting pretty think get thinking first discussion start real world problem suppose according retail market group actually true information retail market group say probability anyone brand make sense probability anyone working three thousand ninety five percent thats nineteen twenty people one person know like whatever yeah suppose select five people enemy whats probability five recognize answer question today whats probability four recognize probability probability three people two one zero stuff today thats field help us discover let first understand scenario mean scenario cal led binomial distribution let talk binomial distribution first right yes thats fixed number independent thats last one go let start one go order fixed number child case five people five people selected person person thats impart important binomial next true like find whether know wont affect whether true know dont child independent make sense third success failure thats either success failure theres need dont finally probability success remains case always percent per person see answer question probability five recognize weve done probability one safe say probability first person person person would five theyre probably building first brand carat decimal four nine five person probability second person one nine five word chance getting case study safe say want probability person ending yeah seven three seven seven three percent seventy seven point three percent let open make x realistic four point seven seven four round yeah sort hopefully make sense idea yeah theres person get probability going decrease slit yeah doesnt recognize people village people world wide breaking ball yeah probability theres whats probability first percent plane honey let ninety five next meant next night try next last first elephant point point oh five one person thank person recognize would make sense theres chance theres chance nod sis gon na ask yeah thats right saw one yes sure totally whats probability percent whats probability five percent four five alright would except problem theres problem one scenario scenario recognize recognize well could like probability fifth person crap number would different appointe another way arrange five people recognize another property multiplicatively whoa regard multiplication math correct saying four point five number id multiply however situation different situation fifth person fourth person third second could also problem becomes complicated would would yeah yeah agree one way happen four five recognize another way would one five probability another way matter order matter term person recognize doesnt matter like doesnt tobe like first person recognize doesnt like theres like specific doesnt acknowledge everybody opportunity recognize well say everyone opportunity person recognize theres equal opportunity yes look closely one scenario five weak becomes problem flip page go dont want every read realize number arrangement success es one failure let redefine number ways arrange thats combination race arrange doesnt necessarily matter different group four many fine arrangement four five choose get please fine five people five people number group inside would fine think second yeah yes five people five people number different group four fine first one two three four thats one group one two three five thats another group one two four five thats another group two three four five get month one three four five moving one group one two three four move one one two three five move one one two four five one three four five theres five four feel like crucial moment gon na make lesson moment either gon na get math behind put type p roud five ways arrange group four four success es one failure result point two oh three six twenty percent oka yin word remember math failure four one many exist five five five cant describe relieved much said one scenario right let ask dere right thats scenario nine five nine five oh five point oh five could also right thats another scenario wouldnt still four nine five five four four nine five seven oh five hundred thats another one theres five theres five ways sure five ways theyre mathematically speaking commutative demonstrate dup doesnt change math always four success es one failure number number times thats possible said said number ways give opportunity person know going give really good news going really really good news calculator calculator thats break traditional statistics model going give one example numerically probability three five recognize brand many three exist five tell many group three seven five put five ten huh oh yes theres ten said say time explain ten bees ill start um three five right u h theres ten possible ways three success es five thats right theres ten ways three five word backup scenario like theres ten ways sand say theres ten ways math always map always theres ten ways still going three two result twenty one percent yes doctor probability probability yes two percent thing thats probability three people five make sense fit ninety five percent people recognize three five maybe pretty low dont know went much ninety five high probability probability scuse probability two go thing two make fraction small squared point zero two five see many number result yeah like really important get number people time see product getting yeah number like five people losing one person really drop ass giving right path idea reason murder second five actually good theyre acknow ledging two people recognize probability low point oh five times make ultimately make ways percentile percentage bring sit really low actually good yes thats point oh five times square nine five three times someone give number put eight point eight five seven multiply three get point two one four good go calculator fascinating actually calculation binomial distribution works follow pun dont intend tobe let actually explore dont get ill catch second bear clear go theres initially method later oh bino scroll yeah jordan come getting getting second bear key scroll ing scroll said front alpha bone actually many dont way like sort different ill give like bino goes like tha tokay first step whoa bethel tag wall first one number trial case number five put five chat five gon na take vandalism probability success probability success five reduce oh comma like kame k kame k child number taking recognize brand case name probability success point nine five fixed change thats part binomial x value number success es many success es want particular case recent one need three let put three enter paste fact give us way pattern exciting exciting deal whole lengthy formula get thing five success es probably beginning way call way dont know second enter youd second enter bring right back last thing let number five chance success point nine five number success es want first problem first one five let five expect see point seven seven thirty four good like thats relief honestly deal formula crunching get away point id rather discuss problem let calculate like normal hey dude yeah one thought said theres someone hold undo yeah theres insert insert stuff second delete advanced calculator one yo yeah cool somebody give functionality think cool next one actually tables could actually say set number child swatch let go back go bring back let clear clear enter look closely number trial success child dis cussed many success es want yet every single situation cool pharmacy hit enter havent dis cussed put thanks p p would point nine five x blank blank menu get list list list answer gon na store store answer answer list going store column li give store let look table hanging store right stop edit clear want clear yeah want clear tables going clear tables second memory clear go shall yeah gon na get sweet second enter second enter second enter hit enter answer list success es alist want take answer store store answer list column accessible buttons second right second notice see store list go edit theyre answer number success es success es success es look familiar based weve calculating havent done chance five people exceedingly chance one person also small besides every mutation three negative five right basically four three exceedingly exceedingly small make sense make sense one zero zero zero zero sorry theres chance person one five recognize chance pretty low get like probably one person chance two people three people five four people five five people right add hundred percent good job numerically table stack really well good job thank everyone say good bye
