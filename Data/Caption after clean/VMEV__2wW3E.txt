tell us hi ram solve equation plus square root x plus equal x plus following see sides yeah thats reasonable enough got way minus squared sides square root x plus squared x plus make sense x plus squared x plus pattern square binomial expand right hand x plus times x plus get x squared plus plus x plus sides get left hand take x get take get negative make sense right hand see times negative negative plus negative make sense product property solve equation thats property look two thing sand take product equal one must equal mean x plus equal x minus equal x plus equal thats x equal negative equal thats x equal write step say x equal x minus equal get right subtract get right checked answer substituted negative original equation substituted negative show plus square root negative plus equal negative plus see else becomes square root becomes get plus equal false true wrote tried solution substitute get plus plus root principal root talking taking positive square root plus equal works say answer right whole exercise want us know example deductive example deductive reasoning star ted known statement known could call known fact assume thats fact star ted logical operation able step step able manipulate truth star ted fact logical operation able come fact sand go way check answer sand eventually come notion must also true deductive reasoning start fact use logical step logical reasoning come assuming trend continue star ted something know true get something else know true bit probably wondering negative wasnt solution little bit hint ill let think didnt end solution took square root took positive square root anyone say square root like positive square root principal square root take negative square root equation would h eld plus negative equal ill let think step equation would negative number worked something square sides nothing actual question hand ill leave past deductive reasoning
