k let say math supposed learning exponential trouble exponential unfortunately math class probably terribly supposed drawing label ing axes graph equal x thing teacher seem think drawing label ing essence mathematics cant help wonder conscientious student would situation start like play one drawing line one blue little piece paper split two line like neck mythical every time one head get chopped blue line grow two place want see get way bottom page following rule draw little end dont get far first try decide try time spacing thing little beginning unfortunately thing filling fast though got farther last time maybe room maybe sharpen pencil get bottom page oh dont forget draw label axes broad swing sword head thats doubling number well see going try teach math wield purpose sin case thats going lot luck maybe drawing binary tree straight like interesting enough game hold attention start drawing arbitrary less arbitrary start drawing binary tree look like tree maybe cant see tree high quality camera much like math classis fuzzy unfocused altogether good maybe change rule slightly make ternary bush branch sprout three math class minute soon need interesting doodle go back game line split sat every level time instead trying squish let hit crash theres fiery explosion turn notebook sideways make sure getting horizontal go back mythology method instead neck keep growing found neck stick together get close instead growing new fill blood might seem little morbid math class maybe curriculum wasnt appalling teaching method werent atrocious wouldnt entertain doodle game something interesting like simple rule splitting triangle pretty awesome point learn cellular automata show simple doodle lead mathematical result cool beautiful theyre famous least famous people like good invent ing doodle might even end real mathematics math class anyway maybe dont care accuracy maybe try game dont keep track spacing make mistake accidentally grow head shouldnt roll youve introduce element random error want know affect final picture still look like pretty awesome doodle many lack structure speaking structure maybe really class seemingly never going end start looking number neck trying figure pattern maybe havent forgotten two anyway hope provided something entertaining next time luck math class
