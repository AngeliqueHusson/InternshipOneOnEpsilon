hi joe lesson cover introduction number system convert decimal binary number system system let take close look number let say example actually times plus times digit digit digit actually power digit first power first power third digit right would digit fourth digit right would thousand digit third power basically number system works decimal number system base expressed times plus times times first power plus times power number system used two different value would base number system base also cal led binary would count like starting two keep mind soon get roll back first digit need count second digit would come next binary let fill leading another way look count first rightmost digit least significant cal led middle leftmost digit rightmost digit represent middle digit two digit power power digit since two value case number try convert binary decimal equal second power plus first power plus times power simplify make pretty binary equal decimal convert bigger number let eight digit binary number convert decimal going little table two two zero way two seven calculate pretty simple double start one rightmost digit time move one digit left going put number basically number mean plus times plus plus times easier way look look bit weight first bit left look whether checked whether bit checked going add bit checked nothing bit checked add total checked skip ped bit checked add total bit checked total bit checked four checked simply add four get decimal equivalent let try another conversion let convert similar binary going direction time going convert decimal number binary going start table however going approach problem differently converting another direction first compare less going check digit going compare greater put going subtract decimal left distribute across binary conversion less going put move less put move greater going put get well move less place greater put two digit going subtract place left done conversion decimal binary let look base number system also cal led hexa decimal number system represent total possible value digit move one digit left increase factor time case though digit digit power one digit represent power system decimal number system hexa decimal b represent f table summary show hexa decimal f equivalent decimal equivalent notice exactly equal four binary digit sare set reach make sit easy convenient change hexa decimal binary digit snow let let try converting hex number binary let convert hexa decimal binary way notation used commonly used indicate hexa decimal number number first going look table well equivalent binary going look table equivalent binary n want look table could show short cut second x equal pretty simple conversion table matter second could see digit set two digit set plus equal decimal equal first digit digit set equal decimal let try converting hexa decimal number decimal number going decimal course already established equal hexa decimal equal place plus times digit add together go decimal hexa decimal equal decimal one pretty simple let try bigger number going convert hex time going different direction different approach start dividing get going divide get remainder going divide remainder equivalent bas know table hexa decimal equivalent decimal important copy right order least significant bit first remainder got division bit b remainder got second division last remainder significant left bito kay decimal works final note number system notation commonly number sare small subscript indicate base number base decimal shown example small denote base normally see written subscript natural assumption decimal number default case unless see spring case almost always conclude binary depending context one zero one one subscript two hexa decimal number subscript hexa decimal sometimes hexa decimal often use notation use throughout presentation preceding number n use subscript presentation subscript tend little hard read thank much joining us hope learned something lesson number system converting decimal binary hexa decimal number system converting decimal binary hexa decimal number system converting decimal binary hexa decimal
