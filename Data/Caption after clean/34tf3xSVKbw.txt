discriminant part right herein quadratic formula b squared minus without entire quadratic formula zero quantity b squared minus without square root find nature number solution quadratic formula would calculate b squared minus keep mind form ax squared plus b x plus c equal coefficient front squared term b coefficient front x term c constant make sure everything side set equal zero calculate greater zero meaning positive youthen want evaluate perfect square like going two real perfect going two real theyre going irrational meaning like square root cant simplify like square root square root comes get one real solution whether add subtract quantity know cancel ling b repeated root mean sis factor quadratic would get solution twice third case b squared minus less meaning negative quantity underneath square root would negative take square root negative number thats get call going get two negative b plus quantity negative b minus quantity right example well take look works example see b positive c b squared minus get b squared squared minus times c value comes minus equal see greater positive perfect square get two real rational solution solution sare point whats type solution many next example weve got b squared let write b squared would negative squared minus times times c get minus notice positive meaning greater perfect square getting real theyre irrational solution irrational one weve got b squared squared minus times times c give minus equal see thats case one real solution repeated solution mean graph parabola exact graph basically going going touch x axis one point going vertex last case going b squared minus minus times times thats give us negative notice less thats last case mean going get two imaginary solution call complex solution
