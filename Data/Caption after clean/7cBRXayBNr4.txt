hey yo welcome tech math channel gon na looking today easier way long division launch straight probably going take couple get going sort deal section deal know obviously getting easy stuff difficult along first going launch straight mean sort question going look many times go couple going draw attention start particular question get idea rest divide certain certain big know bigger becomes whole lot easier get little different way normal division first first thing probably want notice going rub going put probably actually minute looking number comes next k nearest number particular number k much get actually add one number cut thing really really important get first actually dividing number two thing idea going call multiplier thing dealing number multiplier times number us another already got thing becomes important especially start dividing different sort get different multiplier slightly different n get confused yet k going start bit weird type division actual answer get part answer see mean first part going start going looking particular going go like normal division divided remainder nice let get next part bit going two said going use part answer already got get next part answer show start start use actually add two multiplier multiplier times number show mean like two going end answer going add plus number times multiplying going add equal going see many times guy bear us take bit getting used punch get used nothing back divided right next part answer right carried get next bit answer go zero add something review remember number look previously toi leaving multiply two multiply two point one two nothing plus two equal divided next part answer going get part let remember going add multiple one time one point five one one plus one equal two two equal one thats part answer answer far lead last number going draw bit line actually remainder get going get remainder well remainder look six need six well need number one six plus one remainder remain sentiment answer pretty cool right really recommend trying go go bit slowly deal works going keep previous number going another n next video actually going bearing number showing happen use get used n take long process really really really great fast method long division get next question say look many times go say even bigger number move going add multiply end getting bit going dividing multiplier think provide big one little bit harder previous one let start number dividing say highlight dividing number two two divided two equal one nice easy start alright alright let get next one rub get onto next number eight remember eight well got add number times multiply one times multiply one one going add eight eight plus one equal nine divide divided two equal four got remainder one gon na one going take across next part question going put four right let get next bit remainder c fact going touse right n give us move one across wan ted going add four times multiply let add get right give divide remainder seven remainder right get onto last number remainder last number remainder go ten plus seven times one seven divided two remainder remainder one leaves work remainder got answer left working remainder simple matter getting fourteen add eight times multiply also eight eight equal going notice remainder remainder bigger actually dividing get tape get answer remainder got going get rid right going answer four seven nine remainder three hope understand next video going getting going looking little bit going start getting going change mainly around start get video start change multiplier think small step start question let us know hope get final note see next time long division trick fast calculation long division trick fast calculation long division trick fast calculation
