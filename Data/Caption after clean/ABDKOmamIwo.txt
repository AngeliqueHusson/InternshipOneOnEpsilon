bam r starting one favorite topic trigonometry study triangle rotation around circle used engineering real life item big ruler straight edge stuff like lot mathematics rotation sphere live globe lot mechanical item spinning item think engine spinning crank shaft trig important later mathematics engineering let get star ted basic idea definition going introduce standard position angle try probably two part video explain radian measure sare another way measuring rotation besides degree standard position vertex origin initial side positive side x axis wan ted start drawing standard position angle would start origin initial side positive x axis terminal side part move standard position angle wan ted draw degree angle bam terminal side well fine incomplete picture one definition talk angle measurement two angle measurement full rotation either degree radian might know mean yet radian hopefully end video k initial side terminal side need add extra part diagram indicate direction rotation much rotation going draw little arc going indicate counter clockwise rotation say drawing degree angle well wan ted draw negative degree angle would negative rotation look like going draw another angle exact picture well angle standard position vertex origin share initial side first part new angle drawing want rotate negative degree well positive rotation counterclockwise positive side x axis initial side think might guess negative degree clockwise rotation positive side x axis something like initial terminal side another initial terminal side negative degree angle k go drawing standard position angle vertex origin positive side x axis rotate counter clockwise positive rotation clockwise negative rotation later textbook class probably study ing know read compass compass rotation bearing going based due north might little bit get question bearing standard position angle start positive side x axis like navigation angle see got v plane quadrant quadrant quadrant quadrant v degree quadrant negative degree quadrant v let talk idea angle angle separate full rotation degree want angle degree going look like going standard position going share initial side standard position angle share initial side vertex origin know say coinitial angle say angle cohabit ate coexist cooper ate work together share sha ring terminal side big deal side move share initial side standard position angle degree going look like degree angle complete picture degree angle angle degree angle n know without little indicate direction rotation much need rotate additional full rotation going show start positive side x axis rotate positively want decided positive rotation going rotate way around get back terminal side many degree full degree plus additional degree make angle plus degree could also rotate opposite direction well could instead like done could subtract show angle rotation instead going counter clockwise would go clockwise arc able read anything could minus get negative would negative degree add subtract full rotation get one definition quadrantal angle drawn angle quadrant drawn angle quadrant negative rotation draw angle let say degree rotate exactly degree landing terminal side axis line actually quadrant exactly angle quadrant quadrantal angle angle measurement integer multiple going considered quadrantal angle terminal side going quadrant k get next topic measure rotation radian sand degree care another way measuring rotation certain mathematics mathematics thing spinning lot like engineering navigation around globe round sphere mathematics done easier radian measure instead degree let talk full rotation bad radius circle rotated got bottom heavy circle let talk measure rotation comfortable degree see ca n convert idea radian radian want talk idea pi every time see letter pi stand approximately mean automatically radian measure pi lot radian know comes lot student well take circle maybe actually round going length r going try best estimate length wrap around perfect circle maybe somewhere around one length radius one length radius let estimate best say probably somewhere around lay another length radius circle radius es finally let another length radius probably radius es circle almost side circle measure rotation comfortable degree gotten side circle rotated degree counting radius es almost think left little bit gap value think little piece right little piece approximately equal radius es number radius es radii get half way around circle say pi ratio entire circumference diameter get way around circle formula going based radius diameter going say true number radii get half way around circle half way around circle degree degree equal pi radian think got idea name radian well measured based radian based measure radius circle radian found r stand arc length dividing length radius regardless big circle one shape perfect circle regardless size circle radius es take get halfway around circle pi radian equal degree nice k also might note radian get somewhere near end quadrant radian get radian still going quadrant almost getting degree getting close running time next lesson going look converting degree radian building angle around know eventually video know eventually unit circle hugely important memorize rest trig r right back standard position angle radian part standard position angle radian part standard position angle radian part
