today welcome tech math channel going able look video work perimeter harvest circle also known circumference circle start work going couple term get working circle first idea circumference theres circle circumference distance around outside one way around known circumference measure circle couple ways also measure measure either point middle edge known radius use another measurement looking say whole entire distance across circle known diameter might realize diameter radius radius half way across incentive edge theres another radius theres radius radius air radius half diameter thats really really important thing know going use radius workout circumference circle way follow going going use formula theres way around remember formula formula circumference equal pi r two times pi times r pi pi number irrational number basically number dividing circle circumference diameter value around dotted easiest way ever usually get calculator one thing calculator ill put calculator top calculator computer change view scientific one move across see pie calculator comes computer use button thats way get exact answer people go use theyll get slightly different answer leave use pi pi button get exact answer going work circumference couple couple different question might get ill leave formula right let work say circle like know radius radius get ked know circumference perimeter formula going use circumference equal times pi times r going circumference equal times pi times ill get calculator work let work end times times equal see rounded point zero seven nine nine point zero eight answer seven point zero eight one zero eight one centimeter go one one going ask hit formula say might give question maybe actually give work perimeter shape terrible ill tell part diameter would work distance around outside circumference going see half circumference theres couple going work half circumference right ah well see perimeter going equal half circumference well diameter plus diameter radius equal radius half diamond radius equal ten centimeter got information need work ill move well use everything working first let work c circumference pipe circumference going workout half well get circumference well well add diamond oh circumference equal two times pi times radius ten times let work let get calculator back two times pi times ten equal equal sixty two point eight three centimeter circumference want half circumference half circumference get number divide equal equal half circumference add weve got measurement fact rub going put show little bit better distance going round thirty one point four two two centimeter put going add diameter thats fairly easy let ill rub rest working far going add plus thirty one point four two add together going get answer perimeter one point four two twenty centimeter equal fifty one point four two centimeter go pretty good hopefully pretty good thats type question get give go put actually ill put another one right heck another type question might think better look fine might already flick enter next thing ill go harder example something may say ked work particular shape doorway going doorway thats like bottom rectangle work perimeter going circumference work half circumference one half circumference half circumference circumference pi r r see going diameter radius going half equal times equal let get calculator clear times pi times twelve point five seven twelve point five seven centimeter thats thats would full circle going behalf half sin point five seven divided six point two eight equal six point two eight ill rub work perimeter six point two perimeter going added together another unknown side let sput one well sides going tobe side going equal centimeter equal let start six point two eight centimeter plus plus going equal let look move sell square six point two eight plus plus plus twelve thirty four point two eight equal thirty four point two eight centimeter theater soh owd go hope help type question get circumference anyway see next time
