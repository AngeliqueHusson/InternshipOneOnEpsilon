first want know graph tangent graph equal tangent x key thing remember know graph repeat example could draw another cycle tangent thing would also know go like keep way stand inverse graph function fail horizontal line test right draw horizontal line actually intersect ing graph one point restrict graph ing tangent restrict ing domain negative pi positive pi happen one period tangent fashion going know horizontal line going cross graph mean horizontal line test inverse graph function know analyze gon na find inverse graph interchange x x gon na get graph arc tangent first thing want label point point negative pi comma negative go ahead label negative pi comma negative gon na interchange value gon na graph ing negative negative pi pi approximately right mean negative fourth gon na approximate help us graph negative negative point origin thats easy k point pi comma comma going going interchange value comma already switched negative fourth let go ahead plot negative negative would right negative fourth going right going put put point going right right comma three force going right right next thing going going take vertical asymptote reflect line equal x line end getting instead line end getting horizontal line asymptote becoming horizontal asymptote going pi one point five seven going put right right right negative one point five seven thats going right like going tangent inverse graph going look something like let see going look like notice line equal x sketch equal x slope see original graph tangent original graph reflected line tangent inverse graph like graph arc tangent tangent inverse take x also make sure take asymptote reflect line equal x get horizontal asymptote pi negative pi got hope video subscribe channel check math tutor ing video math tutor ing look forward helping talk soon graph arc tan tangent inverse graph arc tan tangent inverse graph arc tan tangent inverse
