theory social mathematically model analyze people organization method used predict outcome game throne determine fate commonly field social network analysis graph also cal led network vertices edge represent something relationship individual might represent help us understand spread disease well focus model social network whether relationship positive negative word theyre friendly hostile notion structural balance example graph show three people ne green edge rober get fight switch edge red indicate new status among theres four essentially different three relationship two green one red one green two red theyre already social like one green edge stable call stable balanced three green edge sned rober triangle balanced everyone content one reason change friend rober radar get fight theres one red two green awkward position ne either pick side rober theyll switch two red hell convince become theyll switch back radar thats story instability say triangle one red two green edge balanced two red edge sand one green rober fighting ne fighting plies saying enemy enemy friend ne bad news youve got go one motivation change relationship triangle triangle red everyone fighting everyone else balanced likely two people join force uniting around common enemy two triangle three green edge two zero two assumption behind idea structural balance course overly simplistic complicated still learn exploring consequence model mind let extend idea structural balance bigger network like one person edge encode nature relationship either green friend red notice two people either friend every person connected every person green red edge kind graph every vertex connected edge every vertex complete graph focus correspond everyone know everyone else classroom pick three people graph three vertices edge connect form triangle little triangle either balanced graph many different triangle one every group three people triangle either balanced little formed select ing three balanced say complete graph also balanced pretty strict condition one triangle unbalanced entire unbalanced ways could chosen extend definition structural balance bigger network definition would different consequence well stick local definition balanced network balanced triangle balanced many different ways color graph green red balanced given specific assignment friend simply look whether theyre balanced conclude whether entire network balanced like make bigger general statement type always balanced always unbalanced pause want think way label graph balanced color everything green everyone friend swith everyone else case triangle inside graph green obviously balanced another way grass balanced two rival faction vertices friend vertices friend two vertices social perspective fact network necessarily good thing closer stalemate state harmony example thing unpleasant perpetually wasnt fell love sent network balance thing change balanced two rival group sand end everyone peace cross group fact proved two ways complete graph balanced word complete balanced graph either everyone everyone else vertices graph split individual friend swith member group member group thats complete balanced graph let prove theorem well start assuming balanced complete graph edge might green thats boring case let assume least one edge goal divide vertices two rival faction prove theorem might seem tricky since dont know anything specific number green red edge know graph balanced thats need know assumed graph least one red edge start two vertices either side edge well focus purple one purple vertex connected every vertex green red edge color purple vertex friend connected green edge blue color purple one connected red edge yellow two rival blue vertices plus purple one form group yellow vertices form group know everyone member group let look two yellow vertices purple vertex must friend form balanced triangle two blue vertices friend purple vertex must also befriend form balanced triangle know blues yellows blue friend swith purple yellow purple way form triangle blue yellow star ted assuming triangle graph local property three people interact proved global property entire graph must split two enemy group knowledge interaction told us something group big vertices network represent thing besides people example world war one graph represent relationship russia aly graph structurally unbalanced finally split two group balanced configuration balanced state one could easily persuaded change alliance led war description weve linked paper de scribing example many different faction fighting theyre nowhere near structurally balanced may configuration near future fun happen tweak definition structural balance let define complete graph weak structural balance none triangle graph two green edge one red edge previous definition structural balance forbid forbid triangle weak er definition structural balance coloring complete graph balanced like everyone friend split two rival group definition structural balance also allow challenge problem week possible complete graph weak structural balance word color complete graph forbidden sub triangle green one red prove guest sleave answer dont many comment respond week skive pretty much awesome could go beach found one question wan ted respond voter indistinguishable theyre thats great question answer case dictatorship thats one voter different rest voting system vote count little good question want get challenge winner kat close collective proved either first last overall voting system unanimity independence irrelevant alternative collective thread theyre answer ing question love collaboration go read thread check thanks guy
