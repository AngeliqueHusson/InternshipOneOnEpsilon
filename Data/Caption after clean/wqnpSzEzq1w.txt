want another think sum infinite geometric series well use similar idea used find sum finite geometric series let say geometric series infinite going start k equal never going stop going way infinity never going stop term going first term times common ratio common ratio k th power actually let k color way infinity let call thing right call sub infinity going way infinity right expand going equal times r actually let write like aa times r power plus times r power plus times r power plus could keep going think get general idea like tried derive formula sum finite geometric series said well happen take sum multiply every term common ratio every term r let imagine sum going multiply every term rand reason said proofy always clear little bit multiplying something times infinite infinite sum least least give general idea start thinking infinity sometimes think thing little bit r times infinite sum well thats going equal going multiply every term times r r power times r going times ra times r power multiply one times going get times r times r think see going multiply one times going get plus times r power would keep going wed keep going let show plus dot dot dot happen subtract sum top sum left hand side could express sum sub infinity minus common ratio times sub infinity going equal subtract going times r power really thats going times r times write color equal abut every term going times r subtract times r times r subtract times r every term going away happen way infinity never never term left first one actually try solve sum factor sub infinity left minus minus r times sum times minus r equal divide sides minus r get sum thing kind amazing result taking sum infinite number term sand proper going get finite value going equal minus r kind neat let say sum let say star ted time multiply plus times times going ill multiply oh sorry brain working times going times going times going actually right brain working right times going going keep going forever notice term starting get smaller smaller smaller well actually getting smaller smaller smaller multiplying every time know sum going going first term going minus common ratio common ratio case going equal thing times equal amazing taking sum infinite term able get finite result happen well common ratio absolute value common ratio less term going get smaller smaller smaller even see even works mathematically denominator going get reasonable answer make sense term sare getting smaller smaller smaller thing converge even r r still dealing strictly geometric series obviously r really going well first term kind debate depending define first term said would clearly youd left sum still formula derived hold start break r equal negative r equal imagine plus plus plus agoing forever r equal negative keep oscillating minus plus minus sum value keep oscillating two general infinite geometric series going converge absolute value common ratio less another way saying common ratio negative
