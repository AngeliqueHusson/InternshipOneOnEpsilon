let ton example make sure getting trig function thing well let construct right construct right triangle want clear way defined far work right trying find trig function angle n part right triangle going see going construct right triangle let focus right triangle let say triangle let say length seven let say length side let say four let figure hypotenuse going know let call hypotenuse h know h squared going equal seven squared plus four squared know theorem hypotenuse squared equal square sum square two squared equal seven squared plus four squared equal forty nine plus sixteen forty nine plus sixteen forty nine plus ten fifty nine plus six sixty five h squared let write h squared different shade h squared equal right forty nine plus ten fifty nine plus another six sixty five could say h equal take square root sides square root square root sixty five really ca n simplify thing thirteen times five perfect square prime ca n simplify equal square root sixty five let find trig let find trig function angle call angle theta whenever always want write least works write soh toa soh soh toa vague trigonometry teacher maybe read book n know know type dian princess name soh toa whatever useful mnemonic apply soh toa let find let say want find cosine want find cosine angle wan na find cosine angle say soh toa tell us cosine part tell cosine adjacent hypotenuse cosine equal adjacent hypotenuse let look theta side adjacent well know hypotenuse know hypotenuse side ca n side side kind adjacent n hypotenuse four adjacent side side literally right next angle one sides kind form angle four hypotenuse hypotenuse already know square root four square root sometimes people want rationalize denominator n like irrational number denominator like square root sixty five wan na rewrite without irrational number denominator multiply numerator denominator square root clearly change number multiplying something multiplying number one wo n change number least get rid irrational number denominator numerator becomes four times square root sixty five denominator square root times square root going n get rid irrational number still numerator let trig least core trig learn future actually ton derived let think sine theta go soh toa soh tell sine sine opposite hypotenuse sine equal opposite hypotenuse sine opposite hypotenuse angle side opposite go opposite open opposite seven opposite side right opposite side hypotenuse opposite hypotenuse hypotenuse square root root wan ted rationalize could multiply times square root square root numerator get seven square root denominator get sixty five let tangent let us tangent ask tangent tangent theta go back soh toa toa part tell us tangent tell us tell us tangent equal opposite adjacent equal opposite opposite adjacent angle opposite already figured seven open seven opposite seven seven side adjacent well four adjacent four adjacent adjacent side four seven four figured trig ratio theta let another one let another make little bit concrete cause right saying oh tangent x tangent theta let make little bit concrete let say let say let draw another right triangle another right triangle everything dealing going right say hypotenuse length four let say side length two let say length going two times square root three verify works side squared let write two times square root three squared plus two squared equal two going four times three four times three plus four going equal twelve plus four equal sixteen sixteen indeed four squared equal four squared equal four squared theorem remember work might learned geometry might recognize triangle right right angle drawn get go show right triangle angle right thirty degree angle angle angle sixty degree angle thirty sixteen ninety side opposite thirty degree half hypotenuse side opposite degree squared times side hypotenuse said gon na n supposed review triangle although let actually find trig ratio different ask anyone ask sine thirty degree remember degree one angle triangle would apply whenever degree angle dealing right triangle definition future say sine thirty degree hey angle right thirty degree use right triangle remember soh toa rewrite soh toa sine tell us correction soh tell us sine sine opposite hypotenuse sine thirty degree opposite side opposite side two hypotenuse hypotenuse two fourth thing thirty degree see always going equal cosine cosine thirty degree go back soh toa tell us cosine cosine adjacent hypotenuse looking thirty degree angle adjacent right adjacent right next hypotenuse adjacent hypotenuse two square root three adjacent hypotenuse four simplify divide numerator denominator two square root three two finally let tangent tangent thirty degree go back soh toa soh toatoa tell us tangent opposite adjacent go degree angle care tangent thirty opposite two opposite two adjacent two square root three right next adjacent adjacent mean next two square root three equal two cancel one square root three could multiply numerator denominator square root three square root three square root three going equal numerator square root three denominator right going three rationalize square root three three fair enough let use triangle figure trig ratio sixty degree since already drawn sine sixty degree think hopefully getting han g sine opposite adjacent soh soh toa sixty degree angle side opposite open two square root three opposite side two square root three sixty degree angle sorry opposite hypotenuse n want confuse opposite hypotenuse two square root three four four hypotenuse equal square root three two cosine sixty degree cosine sixty remember soh toa cosine adjacent hypotenuse adjacent two sides right next sixty degree angle two hypotenuse four equal finally tangent tangent sixty degree well tangent soh toa tangent opposite adjacent opposite sixty degree sis two square root three two square root three adjacent adjacent two adjacent sixty degree two opposite adjacent two square root three two equal square root three wan ted look related sine thirty degree cosine sixty cosine degree thing sine degree sand guy inverse think think little bit triangle start make sense
