let ton make sure getting trig function thing well let construct right construct right triangle sand want clear way defined far work right trying find trig function angle arent part right going see going construct right let focus right triangle let say triangle let say length seven let say length side say figure hypotenuse going know let call hypotenuse h know h squared going equal seven squared plus four squared know theorem hypotenuse squared equal square sum square two squared equal seven squared plus four squared equal forty nine plus plus sixteen forty nine plus ten fifty nine plus six sixty five h squared let write h squared thats different shade h squared equal right forty nine plus ten fifty nine plus another six could say h equal take square root sides square root square root sixty five really cant simplify thing thirteen times five perfect square theyre prime cant simplify equal square root sixty five let find trig let find trig function angle call angle theta whenever always want write least works write soh toa vague trigonometry teacher maybe read book dont know know type dian princess name soh toa whatever useful apply soh find let say want find cosine want find cosine angle wan na find cosine angle say soh toa tell us cosine part tell cosine adjacent hypotenuse cosine equal adjacent hypotenuse let look theta side adjacent well know hypotenuse know hypotenuse side cant side side thats kind adjacent hypotenuse four adjacent side side literally right next angle one sides kind form angle four hypotenuse hypotenuse already know square root four square root sometimes people want rationalize denominator dont like irrational number denominator like square root sixty five wan na rewrite without irrational number denominator multiply numerator denominator square root clearly change number multiplying something multiplying number one wont change number least get rid irrational number denominator numerator becomes four times square root denominator square root times square root going didnt get rid irrational number still numerator let trig least core trig function swell learn future theres actually ton theyre derived let think sine theta go soh soh tell sine sine opposite hypotenuse sine equal opposite hypotenuse sine opposite hypotenuse angle side go opposite open opposite seven opposite side right opposite side hypotenuse opposite hypotenuse hypotenuse square root root wan ted rationalize could multiply times square root square root numerator get seven square root denominator get sixty five let tangent let us tangent ask tangent tangent theta go back soh toa part tell us tangent tell tell us tangent equal opposite adjacent equal opposite opposite adjacent angle opposite weve already figured seven open seven opposite seven seven side adjacent well four adjacent four adjacent adjacent side four seven figured trig ratio theta let another another one ill make little bit concrete cause right weve saying oh whats tangent x tangent theta let make little bit say let draw another right triangle thats another right triangle everything dealing going right say hypotenuse length say side length two let say length going two times square root three verify works side squared let write two times square root three squared plus two squared equal two theres going four times three four times three plus going equal twelve plus four equal sixteen sixteen indeed four squared equal four equal four squared theorem remember work might learned geometry might recognize triangle right right angle drawn get go show right triangle angle right thirty degree angle angle angle sixty degree angle thirty sixteen ninety side opposite thirty degree half hypotenuse side opposite degree squared times side thats hypotenuse said gon na supposed review triangle although actually find trig ratio different ask anyone ask sine thirty degree sand remember degree one angle triangle would apply whenever degree angle dealing right triangle well definition future say sine thirty angle right thirty degree use right triangle remember soh rewrite soh toa sine tell us correction soh tell us sine sine opposite hypotenuse sine thirty degree opposite side opposite side two hypotenuse hypotenuse two fourth thing thirty degree see always going equal cosine cosine thirty go back soh tell us cosine cosine adjacent hypotenuse looking thirty degree angle adjacent right adjacent right next hypotenuse adjacent hypotenuse two square root three adjacent hypotenuse four simplify divide numerator denominator two square root three two finally let tangent tangent thirty go back soh toa soh toatoa tell us tangent opposite adjacent go degree angle thats care tangent thirty opposite two opposite two adjacent two square root three right next adjacent adjacent mean next two square root three equal two cancel one square root three could multiply numerator denominator square root three square root three square root three going equal numerator square root three denominator right going three weve rationalize square root three three fair enough let use triangle figure trig ratio sixty weve already drawn sine sixty degree sand think hopefully getting han g sine opposite adjacent soh soh toa sixty degree angle side opposite open two square root three opposite side two square root three sixty degree angle sorry opposite hypotenuse dont want confuse opposite hypotenuse two square root three four four hypotenuse equal square root three two cosine sixty degree cosine sixty remember soh toa cosine adjacent hypotenuse adjacent two sides right next sixty degree angle two hypotenuse four equal finally tangent tangent sixty degree swell tangent soh toa tangent opposite adjacent opposite sixty degree sis two square root three two square root three adjacent adjacent two adjacent sixty degree two opposite adjacent two square root three two equal square root three wan ted look related sine thirty degree cosine sixty cosine degree thing sine degree sand guy inverse think think little bit triangle start make sense well keep extending give lot practice next video
