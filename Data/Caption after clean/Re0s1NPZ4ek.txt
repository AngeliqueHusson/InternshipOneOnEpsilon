math talk going introduce formula call analytic geometry analytic geometry little bit different geometry studied plane figure like triangle parallelogram used postulate basically thing example proving example opposite sides parallelogram equal going change way taking geometry begin taking x plane place two point p q plane point sare connect segment reading axes see point p x point q x distance two point say distance two point two horizontal distance expressed subtract x thing point p point q vertical distance two point become interested right triangle marked yellow connect ing p q need recognize really three sides triangle side p q hypotenuse side vertical side subtract horizontal side subtract well quickly get old formula say old back grade grade related slope gradient steepness line segment p q base concept slope rise much travel versus much travel horizontally move point p point q say slope p q rise divided run well substituting sides marked blue red rise run subtract slope p q call em em p q minus pretty straightforward stuff weve worked formula id like develop distance distance length line segment connect ing p q distance p q effectively well look diagram right triangle understand right something cal led square hypotenuse equal sum square two sides express diagram see length would equal plus rise squared well substitute run rise take square root understand length p q square root minus squared plus minus thats second formula like come useful talk certain characteristic triangle mid point formula let adda bit construction point midway p q mark point take look point might able reason halfway point halfway p q think make intuitive sense people question find halfway point thats really simply saying take x plus x divide would give us similarly would thing wed plus formula mid point x plus x could written either order x plus x plus x plus three going use answer lot problem analytic geometry let go little bit develop equation draw line p q going pick arbitrary point call x could point red point could point line passing p q would like find equation line passing p q variety ways going way little bit different teach way want show way think would agree matter place point following would true slope line segment join p p slope q line segment joining q three point lie straight line call collinear well said substitute slope pa slope q get following expression x minus x equal x minus x minus next step involve little bit algebra bad going cross multiply two ratio look something like ill multiply minus x times minus say equal x subtract one times subtract expand distributive property often call foil get expression left expression right would encourage possibly pause video verify get exactly two expression point simplify negative x sides equation disappear thats kind handy actually gather one side equation red thats variable pointy side red x word point leftover stuff minus going little bit common factor ing get left hand side times minus right hand side x plus minus whats kind interesting minus minus look familiar next going divide sides subtract x one left right expression see notice front x red variable x notice subtract subtract fact slope part expression calculation need perform get single value come value arbitrarily call b form familiar us remember learning equal x plus b year learned equal x plus b calling slope line p q slope line b ended intercept algebra really equal b good news fourth formula going use problem want one thing could done last development could taken expression x reversed left right hand side could one side equation would expression looking like might want perform verify first line lead second line told minus familiar really represent rise run really rise x minus run plus minus going constant calculation x get simple sort expression rise times x minus run times plus c another form equation one manipulation turn rise x plus negative run plus c equal going call rise arbitrarily negative run arbitrarily b leave c get ax plus bu plus c equal fact call standard form equation line buried standard form rise run rise b negative run kind handy looking standard form equation line pick right standard form equal b form thats cal led point slope form ill get thats coming next probably running time point ill put example next video thanks watching see soon
