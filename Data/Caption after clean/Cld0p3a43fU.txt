video something little different got chance sit steven record conversation dont know st eve mathematician author several popular math book frequent contributor among thing radio lab new york times put shortly one great mass communicator math time conversation tal ked lot thing centering around one famous problem history math brachistochrone first two third video gon na play conversation lay problem talk history go solution century going show proof st eve sho wed modern mathematician mark lev give certain geometric insight original solution end little challenge probably start de fining problem st eve alright want take crack yeah go st eve yeah complicated u h word first brachistochrone comes two gee check word think pretty sure theyre st eve word shor test time question pose one imagine like chute theres particle moving chute pul led gravity whats path chute connect two point goes point point b shor test amount time think like problem relatively easy describe qualitatively going know want path short something like straight line want object get going fast require starting steeply add length line making quantitative actually finding balance specific curve obvious make really interesting problem st eve really interesting thing mean people first hear assume shor test path give shor test time straight line best say help build steam rolling straight first necessarily rolling mean could picture sliding doesnt really matter phrase thought um much ear lier thought arc circle would best thing idea bit curvature might help turns arc circle right answer good better solution history real solution start posing challenge st eve thats june pose challenge really mathematical world time meant mathematician eu rope particular concerned show smart er brother brother two quite bitter rival actually tremendous mathematician fancied mathematician era better brother know think thought might better around time newton sort old man mean less retired math newton warden mint something like secretary treasure nowadays newton show right stays night solve even though took two week solve steven right thats great story newton shown problem wasnt really please challenge especially someone considered beneath mean considered pretty much everybody beneath yeah newton stayed night solve sent anonymously philosophical transaction journal time anonymously newton letter friend said love dunne tease mathematical thing didnt enjoy challenge solve famous legend upon seeing anonymous solution said recognize lion claw dont know thats true great story everyone love tell story suspect part reason eager challenge mathematician like newton secrete ly knew solution unusually clever maybe going yes imagines solve problem let light take care early shown could could state way light travel whether bouncing mirror refracting air water bend going lens motion light could understood saying light take whatever path get point point b shor test time really awesome perspective think usually think locally term happen particle specific point step back look possible path say nature choose best one yes beautiful say really inspiring mental shift people literally inspiring religious overtone somehow nature imbue property efficient thing leaving aside could say empirical fact light behave idea use principle least time say let pretend instead particle sliding chute light travel ling media different index refraction meaning light would go different speed successively went sort chute think dive case point conversation tal ked snell law result physics describe light bend goes one material another speed made separate video talking prove principle together neat argument imaginary constant tension spring need know statement snell law beam light one medium another consider angle make line perpendicular boundary two material sine angle divided speed light stays constant move one medium next find neat way take advantage fact sine stays constant fact brachistochrone problem whats happening particle sliding chute notice conservation energy velocity particle proportional square root distance top spell little bit loss potential energy mass times gravitational constant times distance top set equal kinetic energy one half times rearrange velocity v indeed end proportional square root yes give idea let imagine glass many different different velocity caract eristic light velocity first one next one next one gon na proportional square root principle thinking limiting process infinitely many infinitely thin kind continuous change speed light question light always instantaneously obey ing snell law goes one medium next v sin always constant move one layer next path know tangent always instantaneously obey ing snell law record probably state exactly property conclusion made look whatever time curve take point curve sine angle tangent line point vertical divided square root vertical distance point start curve thats gon na constant independent point chose first saw correct wrong recognize differential equation cycloid shape trace point rim rolling wheel obvious obvious sine square root property anything rolling wheel obvious genius mark lev rescue want say word mark lev yeah well mark lev clever well nice guy friend mine terrific mathematician pen n state written book cal led mathematical principle generally physics solve kind math problem rather math service science science service math example kind clever thing recently little note short showing look geometry cycloid drawing correct right place principle velocity sin constant built motion cycloid conversation never actually tal ked detail proof kind hard thing without visual think lot enjoy seeing math talking math also really elegant little piece geometry gon na go imagine wheel rolling ceiling picture point p rim wheel mark lev first insight point wheel touch es ceil ling ill call c act instantaneous center rotation trajectory p moment p end pendulum whose base c since tangent line circle always perpendicular radius tangent line cycloid path p perpendicular line p c give us right angle inside circle right triangle inscribe circle must diameter hypotenuse conclude tangent line always intersect bottom circle let angle tangent line vertical get pair similar triangle ill show screen see length p c diameter times sine second similar triangle length times sine give distance p ceiling distance calling ear lier rear ranging see sine divided square root equal one divided square root diameter since diameter circle course stays constant throughout rotation sine divided square root constant cycloid thats exactly snell law property looking combine insight little geometry proof thats cleve rest solution brachistochrone ever seen could call done given whole history problem star ted challenge pose want finish thing little challenge around equation cycloid something interesting pop ped consider object sliding cycloid due gravity think along curve function time think curve defined trajectory point rim rotating wheel might tweak rate wheel object start sliding marked point rim wheel always stays fixed sliding object start rotating slowly increase speed according function turns wheel rotate constant rate mean gravity pull along cycloid precisely way constantly rotating wheel would warm part challenge confirm kind fun see fall equation got thinking look back original brachistochrone problem path decent two given point maybe slick way reframe thinking look instead de scribing trajectory sliding object term x term angle velocity vector make function time mean imagine de fining curve object start sliding turning knob determine angle sliding point time always pul led gravity describe angle knob function time fact uniquely de scribing curve basically differential equation since whats given slope function parameter case time whats interesting look solution brachistochrone problem x plane plane time angle path brachistochrone solution straight say increase constant rate respect solution curve minimization problem straight line highly suggestive way view shor test path problem straight forward since boundary condition object star ted point ended point b x space doesnt look like going one point another space nevertheless challenge find another solution brachistochrone problem explaining must case time trajectory space look like straight line
