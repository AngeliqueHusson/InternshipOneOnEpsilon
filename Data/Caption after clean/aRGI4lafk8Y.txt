inscribe angle different central angle vertex circle two radii would form central angle theres special relationship central angle inscribe angle arc c special relationship written two equation first one say inscribe angle equal half central angle another way saying term arc arc c measure going twice much prior flip around going half arc second key thing intercept mark one inscribe angle vertex circle two one right one right pick random point somewhere circle draw two chord inscribe angle weve two must congruent thats going helpful problem solve angle remember key thing inscribe angle equal half central angle half arc
