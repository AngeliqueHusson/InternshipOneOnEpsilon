ked parallel give us three equation three theyre parallel slope figure equal theyre parallel let line equal plus almost slope intercept form divide sides equation get equal right divided plus slope case slope case equal try line b line b equal six might say hey bizarre character get x answer already could rewrite equal plus x term slope going equal six matter much change x change always going always going slope two definitely parallel different let try line cline c ill c minus equal times x plus actually point slope form point x equal negative equal point negative subtract ing point sand slope already know slope equal sometimes people comfortable form let put slope intercept form confirm put form slope still equal distribute get minus equal x plus times add add sides equation get guy cancel equal plus see slope line line c slope line line c parallel theyre different intercept would line
