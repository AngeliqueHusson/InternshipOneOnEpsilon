ked perpendicular perpendicular one ca n perpendicular perpendicular line visualization perpendicular look like two perpendicular intersect right one line right perpendicular line look like perpendicular line intersect wont intersection intersect right two perpendicular two perpendicular slope orange line let say equation equal x plus let say b equation yellow line slope going negative inverse guy guy right going equal negative x plus interceptor another way think two perpendicular product going negative could write times negative going two guy going cancel going equal negative let figure figure negative inverse line slope pretty easy figure already slope intercept form slope line slope b standard form hard put form let try let line b b x plus equal negative subtract x sides end right hand end equal negative x minus let divide sides equation get equal negative x minus character slope negative equal negative already see negative inverse take inverse negative take inverse negative negative negative two definitely perpendicular let see third line line c plus equal subtract sides get equal negative plus slope case negative guy negative guy guy slope negative negative inverse guy inverse guy negative inverse guy perpendicular either two line line b perpendicular perpendicular equation mathematics high school math khan academy perpendicular equation mathematics high school math khan academy perpendicular equation mathematics high school math khan academy
