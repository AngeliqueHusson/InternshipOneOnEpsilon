welcome ancient practical people practical mathematics talk approach correct fraction general talk practical problem suppose say seven wed like share among boy would say give every boy pie maybe tropic minus give person certain piece sum little bit better actually ked us whats best thing could give every entire pie well enough next best thing may half pie boy pull seven house make hub halves sort give boy chunk pie big half one pie left store share amongst boy guess obvious thing sare divide think cant fraction apparently basically gon na say give every child half pie say thats better giving small little piece give best nice practical result plus best next best thing today call fraction thats written sum fraction form namely numerator fraction actually special notation reciprocal dot top symbol course numeral alright would say want say wouldnt write plus theres practical sense giving biggest piece possible actually quarter pie person plus pie especially added rule want fraction numerator one fraction distinct make taking piece hand actually bit tricky finding example plus theyre actually unique bet little exercise could actually create different way breaking theres distinctive unit fraction size go id like go question actually ked two thousand year later every number actually admit expression actually fraction didnt seem question tables tables value write rip chatsome fraction done every single fraction actually worth appear one first people actually ask important answer actually said yes figured way prove every fraction indeed written fraction cool today court greedy algorithm plain word greedy appropriate second let illustrate example suppose wish write first thing ask whats biggest amount pie give child four way personally question divide numerator denominator force divided tell bigger pie big cant give k id next best thing give pie going take see pie leaves k thats going tooth going leaves tooth three division problem three part school district attack problem way divide top bottom one third one bigger best thing work next best choice look tooth strike front mysterious algorithm cross multiplying denominational thats times minus certify little times thats basically think thats one think piece together mass able take left resort could rewrite taking drew drew well left hip behind take fraction take always moving fraction possibly actually denominator possibly always end smaller numerator numerator took fraction could left numerator motive could left numerator actually put reducing leftist remainder sud remainder replace everything together write sum fraction swith numerator goes let prove method always going work let abstractly claim green pen time fraction b job choose fraction n large possible one n still smaller b went n minus wouldnt work bigger subtract one n claim produce fraction even smaller numerator right work fraction common denominator b n times n b n minus b b gon na check two thing numerator well first better positive start going negative trouble check positive also check smaller star ted smaller numerator right two thing go well thing look chose value n let unravel theres first inequality telling b less n could say n minus b bigger zero bingo exactly wan ted still unravel second inequality thing b bigger n minus n n minus n plus r n minus b know gosh human cant even basic algebra theyre telling minus b actually less wan ted tip algebra essentially prove take value still opt unit left another fraction smaller denominator repeat process left smaller already repeat process smaller dominate integer positive must eventually end denominator one case bepiece back together end fraction expression original fraction see whats greedy algorithm taking possibly greedy exactly first place practical answer problem right thanks much
