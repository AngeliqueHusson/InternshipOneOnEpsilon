going example two binomial theorem formula binomial theorem plus b n watch would say one two thing one either take look one watch advice would felt comfortable first example know maybe try work one see see dont get thing first thing thats crucial one binomial theorem plus middle right plus b n well dont plus middle minus negative need going rewrite plus negative raised third power value expand going role value negative going role b value binomial theorem might would probably multiply one long way think would easier binomial theorem obviously trying emphasize process anything let expand maybe ill write generically plus b third power expand going get choose third plus choose squared b first well get choose first b squared well get b third well case evaluate coefficient start plugging thing going evaluate first video take look one want see evaluate turns also show another video use triangle get easy turns choose turns number choose also turns number choose also turns number last coefficient factor always thats one little part pattern well really filling thing want plus negative third going plug everything rep lacing going replace b value negative maybe ill give little room say cube cube thats going cube plus times well b first power x b negative well plus times first x b squared negative squared last term plug b cube b negative third power cleaning thing cube going x cube x order operation square first squared another going x also notice positive times negative thats going make negative let see next term would times going give us leave x hanging weve got negative squared going make positive squared simply take negative take negative cube tack power hey expanded everything obviously thing said expand coefficient first term last term expand generic plus b binomial formula obviously b notice x coefficient b coefficient negative know actually expand simplify certainly coefficient scan change dont confused remark thing sometimes see people mistakenly sometimes theyll try know take binomial coefficient distribute notice theres plus minus term dont distribute coefficient multiply sup might pick whatever know term whatever factor want multiply right think going domy first another video going first example going find triangle think one thing know kind little trick thing make lot quick er right hope video make sense question question feel free post hopefully someone else steer right direction
