tony going buff needle trick name method propose working piso basically propose would chuck bunch needles randomly floor work pi ha ran go tony due random nature anyway n got needles going floor going one brad lovely brown piece going use match es instead cheap want want draw one line want want gap match es long approximate going going chuck bunch match es board chuck first two completely randomly need lot match es right spread hopefully match es randomly distributed around board got ta going count many match es cross reckon one count brad think match es cross total let see let following calculation divided equal bad bad quite happy ha ran thats close tony yeah yeah pi n perfect large could little go literally play game got match es better get better accuracy mathematician cal led used needles actually get pi accurate think six decimal seeing something akin simulation basically take random sample reason get pie angle match take role course working radian go full degree well radian pi coming game get pi sort setup angle going try explain math say imagine length match l mean distance thing play role position center match call say distance x thing interested angle match making let draw guess like interested angle beta assuming everything completely random measure probability center match well probability density center match position x given essentially thing interested angle sort measure probability angle making basically angle interested somewhere course pi coming want work essentially probability match cross line take two important point condition match cross line well condition match cross line x less sine theta mean x integration go sine course theta integration going pi theta equal l l pi x integration get l sine theta integrate sine theta pi give got answer tell probability going cross line right got n match es want work many cross let call n want work many cross multiply total n total n crossing think got n see got put approximate sign approximately like actually saw pi rearrange equation happy yeah yeah works theory behind pi buff ons match es pi buff ons match es pi buff ons match es
