welcome let talk basic feature graph ing function soften student given sketch graph equal f x sketch draw graph something like equal f x minus equal f x plus upwards like f x plus plus tried often instill upon translation left translation translation right forth never get us straight mind x minus say first example correspond left right f x plus dont even think term like video address another way dealing graph ing function like f x minus f x plus pi without thinking term left goes really get going need actual example graph function equal f x make something right suppose graph comes swoop ing great big arc one unit dip vertex like parabolic type thing one unit let make equal f x suppose ked graph equal f x minus well ked actually modify ing input longer x x minus original graph something interesting ask input like zero x well obviously put x equal getting f month f could say new graph mean whatever graph instead right know graph must coming swoop ing unit leveling must occur ring theres graph guess correspond translation right dont even think number new zero case three year second problem equal f x plus five ill one green sketch well need ask whats new zero x swell negative five obviously new zero x graph zero negative five theres gon na swoop bend one even go right must negative four thats theres graph x plus five third example let get different color gon na mess already messy actually two thing taken graph equal f x plus output madding four take output make higher know id go process pretty straight mean graph green everything four higher zero us higher leveling office high higher must graph like theres graph equal f x plus five plus four mean thought left right translation guess think vertical translation however wan ted option actually even leave like personally tie together rewrite equation minus four equal f x plus five ask modify ing x input yes way whats new zero x si guess negative five clear new zero x wont find upwards wise yes whats new zero new zero wise st whatever happening height zero happening height four great new exercise whatever happening height zero happening height theres graph happening high negative five new zero x people actually think whats new zero whats way tend stay whats new zero exes think four theres matter right thats course complicated function f minus plus forth put front little bit analysis get scaling thats worth another video basic transformation graph scaling dilation forth little next one ill right thanks much
