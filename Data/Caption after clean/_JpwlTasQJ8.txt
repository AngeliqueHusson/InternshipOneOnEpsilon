bisect angle something divide measure two equal bisect ing mean bisect angle first thing need compass keep compass vertex angle set convenient width remember width length width need draw arc across leg angle arc across first one across second intersection first arc leg arc leg keep compass one let say keep herewith compass make arc anywhere interior anger anywhere region let make arc need change width compass need width draw another arc arc keep compass intersection leg keep compass width unchanged draw arc intersect previous arc get point two get angle bisector need join two draw straight line point b intersection arc two angle equal remember arms angle angle bisector raised start point go indefinitely one direction point say angle bisector angle angle equal angle
