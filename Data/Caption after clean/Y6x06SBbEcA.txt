right video going example another video simplify ing rational expression sand use think maybe theres easier way case solve equation six x squared minus five x going basically probably easiest ways try get rid fraction look fraction take least common multiple thing least common multiple x x squared going x squared going going multiply sides equation x squared six x squared minus five x equal one multiply left side x squared multiply right side x squared well least common multiple distribute forget stuff bottom theres next example multiply stuff cancel left distribute x squared x leave minus five x equal x squared quadratic equation got equal x squared quadratic equation remember easiest way usually set one side equal zero ill make left side zero try factor ill add right side ill subtract excuse yes sorry look ill add subtract ill try factor way would factor use x plus x minus simply set piece equal zero x plus give us solution x equal negative x minus equal give us solution x equal thing careful put original expression original equation rather make sure dividing notice plug negative bottom either fraction doesnt give thing know plug bottom either fraction doesnt give fact solution negative positive right next example x plus plus x minus equal well case least common multiple going x plus times x minus multiply sides fraction got x plus plus x minus equal going multiply left side x plus squeeze x plus times x minus multiply right side well x plus x minus sorry got kind distribute x plus minus term x cancel leave times x minus plus distribute x plus x minus x minus cancel leave times x plus right side going quantity x plus times x minus dim going go ahead foil ill get x squared negative minus collect like term dim going multiply left ill get minus two x plus four equal x squared minus two x minus eight quadratic equation going make left side equal zero case notice add ill get positive x ill subtract right side ill get negative minus give negative notice left side aswell negative plus negative add get rid negative ill add sides add get negative right think didnt anything crazy got positive ill subtract got add look k point look like problem thats going factor figure solution could point use quadratic equation excuse quadratic formula remember negative b plus minus square root b squared minus case negative role negative b negative negative plus minus square root negative times times c negative times give us positive plus minus square root underneath look like going get plus would probably leave solution like wouldnt really simplify negative excuse positive plus minus square root havent seen quadratic got example web site aswell quadratic formula solve equation going give definitely negative positive would solution original equation one problem x plus bottom x plus plus x minus equal x squared minus least common multiple x plus x minus x squared minus well factor x squared minus actually get x plus x minus thats going least common multiple multiply sides ill x plus plus x equal x squared minus left side going actually write x plus x minus see thing cancel nicely right side instead writing x plus three x minus three going write x squared minus multiply first term x plus cancel leave x minus three second term x minus cancel let ill leave x plus three right side ill simply six add x plus x get two x two x equal six divide sides two well get x notice check solution plug back original plug bottom first fraction fine doesnt give zero notice plug three either second termor stuff right side equation going get zero bottom fraction actually get zero even bottom one fraction cal led extraneous solution original equation actually real careful rational equation goback whatever answer get need go back plug original equation make sure dividing zero hope video kind question feel shoot ill happy answer soon
