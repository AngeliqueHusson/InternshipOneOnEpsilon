want video give overview quadrilateral sand imagine prefix guess could say beginning word quad involve four something quadrilateral imagine shape sand going talking two dimensional four sides four vertices four example one two three quadrilateral although last n look straight one two three quadrilateral one two three four four sides four vertices clearly four angle two angle three angle four let draw one little bit bigger interesting one right one angle two angle three angle really big angle right look interior angle quadrilateral quadrilateral imagine quadrilateral sand main subdivision quadrilateral sis concave convex concave convex way remember concave quadrilateral really concave polygon number look like something cave example concave quadrilateral look like side cave one way define concave quadrilateral let draw little bit bigger right concave quadrilateral interior angle example interior angle right degree sand interesting proof maybe video actually pretty simple proof show concave quadrilateral least one interior angle measure none sides parallel type quadrilateral imagine interior angle sare less degree sand might say wait happen degree well angle degree would n two different sides would one side would look like triangle interior angle sare less degree convex quadrilateral convex quadrilateral would involve one one right convex quadrilateral could look like four point four sides four angle snow within convex quadrilateral interesting going focus convex quadrilateral going space one type convex quadrilateral trapezoid trapezoid convex quadrilateral sometimes definition little bit different people use different people say trapezoid quadrilateral exactly two sides parallel example would say right trapezoid side parallel side give letter call trapezoid could say segment b parallel segment c know trapezoid said definition little fuzzy people say exactly one pair parallel sides people say least one pair parallel sides use original definition kind thing people say trapezoid exactly one pair parallel sides might something like use definition least one pair parallel sides maybe could also considered trapezoid one pair parallel sides like another pair parallel sides like question mark comes trapezoid trapezoid definitely thing exactly one pair parallel sides depending people definition may may trapezoid say exactly one pair parallel sides trapezoid two say least one pair parallel sides trapezoid put little question mark name regardless definition trapezoid quadrilateral two pair parallel sides dealing parallelogram one thing definitely call parallelogram draw little bit bigger quadrilateral quadrilateral two pair parallel sides opposite sides parallel side parallel side side parallel side dealing parallelogram parallelogram even four angle parallelogram right angle dealing rectangle let draw one like parallelogram universe drawing right parallelogram universe parallelogram tell opposite sides parallel know four angle degree sand proven previous video show figure sum interior angle polygon method could say sum interior angle quadrilateral actually degree sand see special case well maybe prove separate video right would call rectangle parallelogram opposite sides parallel four right angle snow parallelogram n necessarily four right angle length sides equal dealing rhombus let draw like parallelogram parallelogram side parallel side side parallel side also know four sides equal length side length equal side length equal side length equal side length dealing rhombus one way view rhomb rectangle parallelogram assume parallelogram assume something rectangle rhombus let say universe universe rectangle ill draw little bit diagram set universe set right would look like well would four right angle sand would length would look like definitely parallelogram four right angle sides would length probably first learned one first clearly square square could also considered rhombus could also considered rectangle could also considered parallelogram clearly rectangle square rhomb square sand definitely parallelogram one clearly right neither rectangle rhomb square overview give little bit taxonomy quadrilateral sand next video start explore find interesting interesting problem quadrilateral overview perimeter area volume geometry khan academy quadrilateral overview perimeter area volume geometry khan academy quadrilateral overview perimeter area volume geometry khan academy
