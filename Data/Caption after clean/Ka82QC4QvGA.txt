want video give overview quadrilateral sand imagine prefix guess could say beginning word quad involve four something quadrilateral imagine shape sand going talking two dimensional four sides four vertices four example one two three quadrilateral although last side didnt look straight one two three quadrilateral one two three four four sides four vertices clearly four angle two angle three angle four let draw one little bit bigger interesting one right one angle two angle three angle really big angle right look interior angle quadrilateral quadrilateral imagine quadrilateral sand main subdivision quadrilateral sis concave convex concave convex way remember concave really concave polygon number shape sis look like something cave example concave quadrilateral look like side cave one way define concave let draw little bit bigger right concave quadrilateral interior angle example interior angle right degree sand interesting proof maybe ill video actually pretty simple proof show concave quadrilateral least one interior angle measure none sides parallel type quadrilateral imagine interior angle sare less degree sand might say wait happen degree swell angle wouldnt two different would one side would look like triangle interior angle sare less degree convex quadrilateral convex quadrilateral would involve one one right convex quadrilateral could look like four point four sides four angle snow within convex interesting going focus convex thats going space one type convex quadrilateral trapezoid trapezoid convex quadrilateral sometimes definition little bit different people use different people say trapezoid quadrilateral exactly two sides parallel example would say right trapezoid side parallel side give letter call trapezoid could say segment b parallel segment cand know trapezoid said definition little fuzzy people say exactly one pair parallel sides people say least one pair parallel sides use original definition thats kind thing people say trapezoid exactly one pair parallel sides might something like use definition least one pair parallel sides maybe could also considered trapezoid one pair parallel sides like another pair parallel sides like question mark comes trapezoid trapezoid definitely thing exactly one pair parallel sides depending people definition may may trapezoid say exactly one pair parallel sides trapezoid two say least one pair parallel sides trapezoid ill put little question mark name regardless definition trapezoid quadrilateral two pair parallel sides dealing parallelogram one thing definitely call parallelogram ill draw little bit bigger quadrilateral quadrilateral two pair parallel sides opposite sides parallel side parallel side side parallel side dealing parallelogram parallelogram even four angle parallelogram right angle dealing rectangle let draw one like parallelogram universe drawing right parallelogram universe parallelogram tell opposite sides parallel know four angle degree sand weve proven previous video show figure sum interior angle polygon method could say sum interior angle quadrilateral actually degree sand see special case well maybe well prove separate video right would call rectangle parallelogram opposite sides parallel four right angle snow parallelogram dont necessarily four right angle length sides equal dealing rhombus let draw like parallelogram parallelogram side parallel side side parallel side also know four sides equal length sides length equal sides length equal sides length equal sides length dealing rhombus one way view rhomb rectangle parallelogram assume parallelogram assume something rectangle rhombus let say universe universe rectangle ill draw little bit diagram set universe set right would look like well would four right angle sand would length would look like definitely parallelogram four right angle sides would length probably first learned one first clearly square square could also considered rhombus could also considered rectangle could also considered parallelogram clearly rectangle square sand rhomb square sand definitely parallelogram one clearly right neither rectangle rhomb square thats overview give little bit taxonomy quadrilateral sand next video start explore find interesting interesting problem
