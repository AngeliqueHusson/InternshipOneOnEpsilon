produce rational number infinitely many e discipline math wonderful sense love share idea sand question together like comment section show several line forum post question recently one mathematician ked exchange infinitely many pi resulting received provide awesome preview way research intuition collaboration strong desire explore unknown specific kind irrational number certainly subject well focus general post pi e also known number two famous irrational well ask exchange infinitely many pi e get rational number real number appear son number line divided two rational irrational rational written n divided n n mare two integer like equivalent definition rational whose decimal expansion terminate eventually repeat like zero point one four eight five zero point four four three three three three three three three three three even rational think expansion like actually zero write fourteen point six zero zero zero zero zero zero zero irrational arent rational meaning theyre decimal expansion dont repeat well known example include pi root two golden ratio actually proof square root two irrational fantastic classic try link description return original question let start exist two exchange infinitely many one resulting rational pause want think answer yes maybe came different example mine number zero point zero one zero one one zero one one one irrational made string increasing links zero string since string becomes longer never therefore irrational similarly number zero point irrational exchange infinitely many like get two rational night could trade two irrational case one resulting rational irrational back original question two specific exchange infinitely many pi e resulting pie e theres lot different ways could exchange infinitely many could exchange odd get pair every fourth digit get pair eighth ninth digit get infinite time patience could write big endless possible pair arise switching infinitely pi e kind list irrational avid whose work featured infinite chess episode response karma nice question question often pi e different first digit decimal place different pi second digit different pi one free digit exchange digit doesnt anything thing pi mostly finitely many would happen well would finitely many new produced digit swap sand new would differ pi e finitely many mean list would irrational let look pi assume change finitely many pi let look last digit change everything unchanged since pi irrational dont version doesnt feeding pattern therefore irrational notice pi e different finitely many pi minus e rational answer pretty easy pi e happen differ finitely many list irrational seem likely e time differ infinitely many place case produce infinitely many new swapping list would infinitely long remember back hierarchy tal ked different sizes infinity infinity scalled countable bigger anything bigger countable infinity cal led uncountable infinity well pi e differ infinitely list produced possible exchange infinitely many e pie uncountably long actually mean even possible write list metaphorical list ill leave challenge problem show uncountable let us know comment thats important us countably many rational list rational countably many pair number mean infinitely many pair list irrational pi e differ infinitely often list irrational rational mathematician tau answer sort part theres conjecture basically unproven educated guess z pi normal normal number digit sequence equally likely occur look pi number three occur often four sequence often sequence word normal number balanced crazy fact normal know almost every number normal concrete example particular proved pi e normal number seven though believe case cal pointed pi e normal suspect impossible produce rational number want technical argument recommend reading original post linked description intuition produce rational number pi e would part decimal expansion like normal dont like repeat blending two together doesnt change fact list possible infinitely pi e probably theres want highlight question cool one saw two one coming set theory coming number theory favorite part post small accessible preview way math research really happen curious question different perspective known correct answer weve reduced complicated problem whether pi e normal whether infinitely often mathematical intuition recommend check ing original post description subtle detail dont forget answer challenge comment also anyone prove pi differ infinitely many great fact know certain see next time infinite series hello respond episode wolverine problem colour ing first let get important stuff shirt lot lot opinion shirt say let epsilon less zero people usually use variable epsilon sum like really small positive number commonly used calculus also show math let epsilon less zero kind goofy joke may fine alright know ked hand nelson problem colored shape right correct shape fact place restriction kind colored region scan color problem bound chromatic number check article big nelson problem actually tell result theyre pretty cool go check finally gave great answer challenge question lower bound chromatic number plane answer embed graph sho wed plane edge length coloring plane must coat must coloring number bigger one grass number chromatic number graph must figure three need note take two colors color outer hexagon center vertex must third color three vertices central triangle must three different colors adjacent vertices hexagon color cant three colors need least four colors example coloring shown good job see next week music
