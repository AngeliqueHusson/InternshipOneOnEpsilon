music current population million people people million adult obviously want know population thing like percentage identify pacific ocean map percentage dont think exercise important perhaps seriously percentage happy direction statistics like always read theyre always interesting ask exactly possible know stuff like dig statistics told find polled maybe couple thousand people sometimes people put fine point let say one dot represent thousand million entire adult population get even weird er though sometimes read news story say politician approval rating gone five point gone seven point ask exactly possible validate menu change small percentage population actually get even weird er still find claim often made high confidence theyre within low percentage correct answer unbelievable may seem theres actually beautiful mathematical justification going attempt explain simple example say situation exactly half give apple thumb half give thumb another way think ask rate apple pie either exactly zero average rating whole country would precisely understand unrealistic scenario start simple example humor obviously prohibitive go ask every single apple pie scientist wan ted know opinion apple pie would conduct poll subset population let scientist little stupid conduct poll one person one person either say apple pie good give give zero apple pie course useful since already know answer since already know proportion society know one person random give time zero percent time let say scientist decide little ask independently randomly chosen people think apple pie average answer well case either people give apple pie case theyll give zero case average zero theyll give different answer sand case average since already know within society compute odds well get time well get zero percent time well geta half time happen two separate ways course theres reason stop two people scientist keep independently chosen people think apple pie notice distribution word odds getting different average seem conform beautiful shape cal led bell curve whats nice one distribution kind seem pool around correct answer word people ask likely get answer close mean certain according chart point two percent chance get answer obviously nowhere near correct answer possible kind insane even independent randomly chosen people way extremely small survey odds right answer already kind already see happening two people remember theres one way average zero two different ways get average time start effect way pronounced theres still one way get average zero average either case everyone answer hand theres many different ways get average theres many different ways half give thumb half give thumb start even number response way get something closer also seem support idea perhaps really dont survey big course situation keep improving keep taking average people however might object rightly one star ted situation perfect population also even worse even fact great bell curve able know bell curve would appear already knew answer like answer bunch math see distribution look like able figure going look like bell curve real world going know distribution like population whole point conduct ing poll first place situation lot complicated let say still want average rating apple pie instead within population split actually could make situation way complicated let say scientist experimental design ask rate apple pie scale two ten two unbeknownst people population curiously specific opinion apple pie could happen people give apple pie give three give four like crazy distribution population scientist unknowingly walking would situation average would hard figure polling distribution could look like anything could look like could look like could look could look like ah magic magic cal led central limit theorem omit ting basically say sample people population matter population distribution originally like matter proportion sare like original population sample people compute average answer see distributed like bell curve proportion get going look like beautiful ever bell curve sample people cannot stress enough staggering implication goes way way way beyond polling could study ing anything life span tire completion time video game central limit theorem take average enough independent randomly approximate odds average within certain amount population average simply looking specific bell curve fact regardless study ing like handed superpower say detail approximation within technical statement central limit theorem little bit beyond scope video however one implication conduct opinion poll thousand people bell curve would use approximate distribution average time going within right answer pollster never seem ask way couple thousand people anything get far ahead say theyre enormous amount subtle technical detail good really good statistics course statistics textbook save example central limit theorem doesnt really give information quickly population distribution average converge bell curve also hard get independent random sample within population example conduct ing poll decide phone survey data way favor people willing answer phone survey theres lot pitfall await anyone want conduct survey even want high degree care scrupulousness leaving aside fact dont think poll high degree care scrupulousness favorite example bad polling illustrate picture holding paper say lost election course holding victory speech however even though definitely possible misinterpret miss apply result think thankful something like central limit theorem exist without truly subtle understanding world would possible thats say hope guy really video dont forget like comment share subscribe peace music
