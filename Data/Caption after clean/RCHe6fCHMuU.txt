hello name maria miller calm video going study area polygon principle behind finding area polygon simple divide triangle find area triangle add example kind strange looking divide triangle drawing diagonal vertex vertex polygon always divided triangle find area polygon find area triangle add find area polygon though let go find first one theres plenty work example grid ill first divide triangle several ways even example maybe ill see draw line becomes two triangle like upper triangle lower one upper one better write something dont get confused upper base one two three four altitude one unit four times one four divided two two upper triangle two lower triangle base take base four altitude times divided add plus total pentagon divide triangle grid ill show another method method like enclose rectangle first ultra rectangle many vertices possible touching sides rectangle idea easy calculate area rectangle left triangle need subtract triangle right triangle easy find area right triangle herein grid especially area rectangle one two three four five six one two three four five minute thats rectangle subtract triangle aright triangle see choose base side altitude side get times one half done one one triangle aright triangle choose altitude one one two three four five way five times one area two half right triangle two times two garb ha tool area one two square two odd shape divide square slip right triangle three times area theres square way triangle one area one half two one subtract get area one inside plus subtract total square final answer therefore square nice even number didnt purposefully make really like go find area trapezoid dividing trapezoid get rectangle middle draw perpendicular line get triangle protractor doesnt quite reach kind eyeball time two right triangle rectangle middle time measure triangle base rectangle need like done measuring calculate first let put triangle number one thin rectangle two triangle three triangle one first base fourteen point five need divide two need multiply similar multiplication times five notice two decimal two decimal answer two decimal need take thats done yet see multiply times divide two get area triangle take half would hundred twelve point four two five get done ill definitely round formy final answer next well take rectangle thats easy multiply side times side twenty nine point three times thirty three times three nine need decimal point answer one decimal digit one day two answer form third triangle mean third shape triangle need go base times altitude also go twenty nine point three times eight point five decimal two decimal answer sorry danger easy forget divide two answer need divide two gon na erase going divide two one cut decimal one hundred twenty four point five two five square centimeter sand ready find area whole trapezoid three rounding rounding probably nearest ten let add know theyre five five right point nine five square centimeter like mean rounded let round nearest ten get thousand two hundred twenty square centimeter principle difficult difficult figure triangle triangle rectangle need find individual add actually keep keeping track calculation theres many record partial result keep track dont get confused calculation hope helpful
