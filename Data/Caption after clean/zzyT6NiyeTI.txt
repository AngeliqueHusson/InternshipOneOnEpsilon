welcome back another fun evening geometry teacher tonight talking similarity specifically similar triangle begin first place want definition goes two polygon sare similar corresponding angle congruent corresponding sides yes indeed need true similar like may recall mean term shape different size right going begin tonight got graph start input ting hit enter goes magically get point put another point let sput comma comma got b c let go ahead make triangle fantastic see line segment sa b c would like dilation triangle dilation nothing shape object size sound similar said maintain ing size one way well could distance formula c one point four one double carry way could could right could draw far way b c twice way would make dilation right would keep possibly spot let let show something like could go go way somewhere right go right right boom get idea make new triangle course easier compass let move easier compass double segment thing like even better trick know make dilation simply taking point multiplying factor right known scale factor right done taken point see b c doubled everything new point b instead going f double c look triangle made triangle similar make sense similar recording nothing far point bright went get point e went end maya right triangle get thereright make sense every point dilate fact dilation write conjecture one polygon image another polygon dilation polygon similar meaning dilation shape change size could either go smaller dilation multiply scale factor making smaller shape make double course making let specifically talk similar triangle wooden one side one three two triangle similar course would say similar yes equal trunk right every equilateral triangle shape know every angle enough well something like two triangle telling might able figure kind angle relationship sides right one oh every size proportional two triangle indeed similar symbol similar one tilde forgotten yes triangle right relationship x x root triangle sare similar well alright n tell angle n know go one may know sides enough answer course yes sides proportional indeed dilation nothing taking triangle made smaller similar lead us similarity conjecture say three sides one triangle proportional three sides another triangle similar let move onto knowing part tell one triangle two angle another triangle enough say two triangle similar well triangle special three angle know two angle well know third angle right got saying every triangle similar two definitely similar right likewise well whatever right add leftover piece without knowing side links know must similar nothing dilation instead saying conjecture need three angle simply say angle angle conjecture widely known geometry two angle one triangle congruent angle another triangle triangle similar pretty straightforward one know mean one really help us right combination scan give answer give aside angle side given another side going side like one done good congruence conjecture congruent course imagine must similar well yes take one multiply every side two cal led scale factor two going way multiplying get would congruent one half going way yes two sides proportional like like right angle congruent indeed similar said something proportional n really written proportional ratio right write three compare five ratio proportion set equal together five would tobe one half compare two equal well yes simplify one get proportional two ratio set equal right going bunch proportional problem algebra last year right love right think need make side angle side similarity conjecture two sides one triangle sides another triangle included angle congruent triangle similar leave congruence conjecture angle already angle angle angle side angle also n need one n work congruence still n work similarity right think get busy next time see similarity similarity similarity
