voice let review unit circle definition trig function little bit right draw unit circle saya unit circle talking circle radius one example point right point one comma equal one zero point point zero comma one point negative one comma zero point zero comma negative one radius distance center circle origin point circle point circle say radius equal one unit circle definition trig unit circle thats cal led unit circle definition saw define angle bottom side angle along side angle thinking intersect unit say angle theta define sine theta cosine theta cosine theta sine theta x point side angle side positive intersect unit circle example point right would call x point value right would call cosine theta point point right would call sine previous video unit circle really natural extension toa definition whats useful start work negative angle sit even works degree angle works angle degree works angle less really really really useful want leverage already know unit circle definition help prove identity almost fall fact point right circle circle radius one equation circle radius one centered origin well equation x squared x squared video really prove distance formula really application theorem equation unit circle centered origin x squared plus squared equal one equal radius squared distance right equal one weve already said de fining cosine theta x point sine theta point point sitting circle satisfy relationship right mean de fining cosine theta x x value sine theta value satisfy relationship mean cosine theta squared plus sine squared theta needs equal one sine square theta plus cosine squared theta needs equal one thats point x cosine theta x theta satisfy relationship define circle cosine squared theta plus sine squared theta one cal led weve seen cal led identity say useful well know sine theta figure cosine theta going vice know one cosine theta could say know cosine theta use figure theta figure tangent theta tangent theta sine cosine little bit confused identity well really equation circle even came look point right look point right saying x cosine theta sine theta distance point origin well think construct right triangle distance right could deal quadrant ill make absolute value cosine theta distance right distance right absolute value sine obviously dont take absolute value first quadrant went quadrant setup similar right triangle absolute value play know theorem right triangle hypotenuse length one know expression squared absolute value cosine theta squared plus expression squared length plus absolute value sine theta squared needs equal length hypotenuse squared thing going equal one could say going square something sign negative going negative times negative going positive going thing saying cosine squared theta plus sine squared theta equal one cal led identity actually thats even equation circle comes comes straight theorem hypotenuse length one
