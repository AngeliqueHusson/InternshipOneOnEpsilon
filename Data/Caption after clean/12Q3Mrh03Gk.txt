cracking open secure message would easy knew factor episode show twist one cryptography secure communication big prime detailed description check linked description distilled version pretty easy computer find big prime multiply together really hard computer opposite find prime factor really big number prime factor number prime r sa cryptography prime factor like key want eavesdrop need find one key hack need find prime factor big number talking really big hundred long let try small example prime factor well five seven figure probably looking even forgotten fact could checked prime smaller divide know know help boring importantly computer need something strategic factor really enter one great along many many thought lot prime prime modular arithmetic basically underlying r sa cryptography sense use similar algorithm modular arithmetic happen count circle counting modulo goes use less repeat tell time depending convention cyclical counting extend arithmetic operation plus still plus times another way think modular arithmetic remainder slightly formal definition congruent x divide n remainder x times divide remainder times oiler notice something modular arithmetic exponentiation let look easy figure thing remainder divide digit sequence let repeat experiment instead looking let look get two one two one observe sequence get bigger bigger modular version sequence cycle repeat pattern last digit pattern always one long x n relatively prime meaning share prime factor sequence x n x cube n x fourth n always property call length pattern period period three period period important period x n number r r number x r congruent n example fourth congruent first cube back original goal stuff modular arithmetic exponentiation period factor ing large let say give number n tell n times q two prime p q n tell anything prime job find step number smaller n let scall number e selected check make sure n relatively prime common divisor n common divisor two biggest integer two relatively prime algorithm quick standard way find divisor common factor n looking saved rest step step compute period n let sake example let say trying find factor n equal pick equal relatively prime little computation see r equal four make arithmetic work going need divide r two need know r even later also need know r two plus one congruent n thing fail need different step one luckily least chance good value average wo n try many times step three algebra let start fact know r congruent n give r congruent n saying something n assaying multiple n must exist integer k r minus equal k times n since assumed even number rewrite r times r plus k n since n equal p q well replace k q k kind lot algebra often find easier work computation like instead watching someone else welcome pause check step happen swith example trying find factor since period congruent fourth minus congruent fourth minus care value could rewrite equal k times integer k could solve k case irrelevant ill leave variable rewrite minus times squared plus k times p times q p q prime factor searching step four grand finale claim common divisor r minus n one prime factor let p common divisor r plus n prime factor let call q equation r minus r plus equal k p q mean p must divide one list q must divide one factor left cannot divide factor since factor would divisible n neither factor divisible n one assumed r plus congruent n know r minimum value x x congruent n r minus congruent n since p separate factor left side equation assume r minus r plus work part weird algebra argument go ahead pause think example p divisor q common divisor fortunately correct summary step step pick lesson step find period n step well dont need algebra step time since know works instead use step check even r plus congruent n either thing fail need go back step pick new value finally step let p equal rover minus n let q equal r plus done information security obviously catch since r sa cryptography still works step finding period take along time fact exponentially long time might make seem like n done lot construct ing step actually besides pretty fast instead looking needle haystack reduced hard part step finding period big twist period finding precisely kind quantum computer good next episode going dive four step outline next time finish learning use quantum computer dramatically speed step r sa cryptography really trouble see next time infinite series hello want address episode e pi avid one whose work featured original episode ked insist swap ped come digit place swap digit anywhere digit hi well case make rational number prove post linked huh right lots lots ked combining digit sat e pi algebraically instead literally swapping add subtract multiply divide e number pi get number couple cool famous example like e pi equal identity really silly example like e times pi divided e times pi equal also lot thing dont know multiply whether get rational irrational funny almost example pi ninth divided p eighth really really really close pretend kind look like computation hand also e minus pi pi fourth really zero zero kind look like finally challenge complete answer question time differently many digital list produced swapping infinitely many digital uncountably long dancer digit different hi either swap duck therefore label listing whether swap digit use three method one swapping digit one correspond one two proof bureau one uncountable first objection interval written binary second use cantor value elevation great answer also lot great answer way many acknowledge fantastic see next
