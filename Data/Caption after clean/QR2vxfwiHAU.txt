let say ellipse formula x squared plus squared b squared equal sake discussion assume greater band us let us going tobe kind short fat ellipse semimajor axis major axis going along horizontal minor axis along vertical let draw draw ellipse want draw thick er ellipse let say ellipse let draw axe sok horizontal right vertical studied ellipse pretty good detail far know figure semiminor radius case know b b right semiminor radius b smaller b greater would major radius course major radius distance right another super interesting perhaps interesting property ellipse take point ellipse measure distance point two special point sake discussion sake discussion pretty much forever call foci two point always sit along major axis case horizontal axis symmetric around center let call point let call one super interesting fascinating property often used definition ellipse take point ellipse measure distance two let say distance right call distance distance taking point ellipse particular point distance two foci different color whole line right find two distance sum plus going constant actually turns equal turns true anywhere go ellipse let make point clear actually going prove constant distance actually right make sure understand saying let take another arbitrary point ellipse let take right measure distance point focus let call point measure distance point focus let scall point sum two point still going equal write plus still going equal neat actually often used definition ellipse say ellipse set sometimes theyll use word locus kind graphical representation set point sum distance focus es equal play little bit figure figure focus es ellipse first thing feel satisfied distance true equal easiest way figure pick guess could call extreme point along already making claim distance let draw another color distance plus distance going equal constant number extreme point going show constant number equal let figure one thing realize two focus point symmetric around origin whatever distance right going distance right two point symmetric around origin right distance course want figure sum distance longer distance right well sum plus green distance well right plus green let write let write let call distance g say let call g let call h g h also know g everything symmetric g plus h well thing g plus h entire major diameter ellipse well know minor radius length right also distance sum distance point ellipse focus plus point ellipse focus equal g plus h big green part thing major diameter ellipse thing enough hopefully good enough next thing realize figure foci stand equation figure two point let figure first thing realize sudden matter go easy even take point right say k distance sum distance also equal could use information actually figure foci lie let say let draw another one want draw axes clarity let write equation n lose x squared squared plus squared b squared equal take point right extreme point always useful trying prove something dont want say said two foci symmetric around center ellipse already said ellipse locus set point take point distance focus es add get constant number figured constant number figured take distance right add distance right equal could say call know plus equal interesting thing symmetric right length going going everything symmetric two focal length symmetric distance distance distance right way could exact center point ellipse ellipse symmetric around equal equal know equal equal ai think making progress thing think already previous drawing ellipse distance distance semiminor radius already learned band course focal length trying figure already pop brain problem focal length could triangle triangle right one focal length flet call f f squared plus b squared going equal hypotenuse squared case equal nice equation term b awe know b equation given let solve focal length focal length f squared equal squared minus b squared f focal length going equal square root squared minus b squared pretty neat clean pretty intuitive way think something literally take difference whichever whichever smaller subtract one take square root focal distance let see use apply real problem might ask hey find focal length find let add equation x minus squared plus plus squared equal let graph first could interesting draw axes immediately see center center going point negative might want review previous video scenter x equal equal minus center major axis x axis large rand b squared squared equal semiminor radius going equal go go think let go roughly direction semiminor radius going right square root b equal go go ellipse going look something like pick good color going look something like want want find focal focal point going sit along semimajor axis need figure focal distance sand essentially add subtract center sho wed hopefully sho wed focal length distance f focal length equal square root difference two right square root minus focal length equal square root point right point point center ellipse point minus focus right going square root minus focus right going minus square root minus took focal length since along major axes x axis subtract x get right anyway really neat thing interesting relation foci relation focus point sand future video show foci hyperbola foci well one focus parabola really starting get section neat everything done point much mechanics graph ing plotting conic getting little bit interesting part conic next video foci ellipse conic section algebra khan academy foci ellipse conic section algebra khan academy foci ellipse conic section algebra
