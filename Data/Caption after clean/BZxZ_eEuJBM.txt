want make quick clarification add tool complex number first video said complex number z equal plus b used word careful word used everyday sense also formal reality clearly real part complex number clearly real clearly complex number made real number plus imaginary number kind talking everyday term si cal led imaginary cal led imaginary number imaginary part want careful make clear see function real part z would spit function imaginary part z would spit first video would spit number thats scaling iso would spit b someone talking formal sense imaginary part theyre really talking number scaling brain think complex number think real number imaginary number someone say well part imaginary number would given whole thing someone say whats imaginary part give function give b hopefully think word imaginary part clearly whole thing imaginary number right imaginary number real number real number scaling iso call number scaling imaginary part said want introduce idea complex z conjugate z z bar sometimes z little asterisk right would equal minus let see look diagram thats real axis imaginary axis z z height b base length right thats z conjugate z minus comes real axis minus b imaginary part like conjugate z visualize conjugate complex number really mirror image complex number reflected imagine pool water seeing reflection actually look visually add complex number conjugate said like position add z conjugate could essentially take vector shift head right z conjugate point right vector point z plus z conjugate see right visually going algebraically add z thats plus add conjugate plus minus going get two guy cancel going another way think really around math take complex number add going get times real complex number oh also going times real conjugate exact real part said let think conjugate could useful let say something like divided minus real obvious way simplify expression maybe dont like denominator maybe want write one complex number divide one complex number another get another complex number well one thing multiply numerator denominator conjugate denominator plus plus clearly multiplying number number reason valuable multiply number times going get real number let show let multiply going get times plus plus times plus times would squared negative form minus b times plus b well plus b times minus b squared minus b squared going equal squared squared oh plus plus plus number number right conjugate dont know brain must thinking obviously dont want change plus plus let multiply minus b times plus b times going squared minus going equal minus add real minus negative plus imaginary part sand minus squared squared negative squared going negative negative negative cancel plus write complex number negative plus able divide two complex useful thing property take complex number multiply conjugate obviously conjugate conjugate original number would take complex number multiply conjugate would plus b times minus going get real number going squared minus b squared difference square equal squared going negative b squared negative sign cancel squared plus b curiosity magnitude complex number squared neat property make conjugate really useful especially want simplify division complex hopefully found useful
