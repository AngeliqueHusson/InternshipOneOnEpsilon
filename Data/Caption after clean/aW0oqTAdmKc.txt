theorem basically dealing polyhedron made figured formula number face plus number vertices equal number two know two three find quantity show explain little face basically sides polygon like rectangle pentagon know type thing vertices point line segment come together make polygon come together point edge face come together form segment show mean couple example one see like cube maybe square prism maybe rectangular prism main thing let look face see rectangle right left front back basically six let count vertices vertices point one two three four base five six seven eight top eight vertices number edge top bottom sides plus let see make sense equal let take look another example one pentagonal pyramid base pentagon see made five triangle comes point count number one bottom pentagon five way around know six face vertices easy count one two three four five six let leave number minute let plus two equal e plus two subtract two see number edge let see verify bottom pentagon sides see edge last example triangle triangular pyramid prism two bases parallel congruent pyramid one base comes point two bases parallel congruent separate height see theres two bases three rectangle sand make side five face point k number edge top bottom side three line segment k plus got complicated shape know maybe lot sides lot face two could solve missing third quantity hope understand theorem little bit better go ahead subscribe channel check many past video look forward seeing future talk soon theorem theorem theorem
