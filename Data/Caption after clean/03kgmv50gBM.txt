welcome video multiplying dividing complex idea multiplying complex exactly foil method little different simplify ing end think see example idea exactly star ted right away minus want use foil method first going multiply times equal going multiply times negative equal negative multiply positive times positive give multiply positive negative thats going give negative squared move let go back review second know imaginary number equal square root negative square sides equation get squared left side right side square square root cancel left negative know squared equal every single place theres squared replace negative notice expression squared going squared negative everything else expression stays start left minus plus negative negative need keep simplify ing much possible left still middle two like term negative positive negative plus negative right negative six times negative one equal positive six still like term positive positive simplify even equal still negative solution expression minus example divide imaginary divided minus dividing complex never leave imaginary number denominator first step problem get rid imaginary number denominator need multiply conjugate conjugate exactly change sign front term instead minus going plus notice sign front term whatever bottom also top multiplying top bottom conjugate plus bunch foiling ill start denominator denominator times equal times positive equal positive negative times positive equal negative negative times positive equal negative squared thing numerator numerator times positive equal also positive times equal positive positive times positive equal positive six also times positive equal positive squared like last problem want replace every squared term negative know squared equal going erase replace negative let simplify much possible going start left numerator positive middle two like term plus equal positive right positive times negative equal negative denominator left positive negative got rid term right negative times negative equal positive notice eye term denominator wan ted thats conjugate got rid need simplify little bit numerator two like term negative minus equal still positive denominator also equal point sometimes finished particular problem still factor notice numerator common going factor left plus ion inside denominator denominator cancel left one plus solution hope gave better idea multiply divide complex next going making many similar problem stay tuned really hope see next one
