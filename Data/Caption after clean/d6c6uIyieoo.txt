prof ask question brad prof difficult way earn million dollar brad making tube video prof laugh prof well probably know much prof one difficult solve one problem mathematics set clay mathematical institute year problem cal led riem ann hypothesis work german mathematician ber nard riem ann year one problem fact seven one solve interestingly enough person solve problem declined one million show mathematician work problem want make money think famous problem took place last theorem solve drew wile brad n problem prof problem prof essential thing call riem ann zeta function riem ann zeta function function function rule assign every value number riem ann zeta function assign certain number value number given following divided power plus divided power plus divided power example set x going divided squared divided squared plus divided squared plus divided squared one example mathematician call convergent series mean sum first n term get answer get closer closer number number approximate cal led limit limit actually interesting famous problem mathematics find limit cal led problem name city problem solve great mathematician answer surprising sho wed sum pi squared may wondering sum circle would pi squared show came beautiful going explain something easily find series one example riem ann zeta function try value example take get reciprocal sum convergent series wonder answer would zeta also try substitute negative number sand interesting substitute substitute going get get divided plus plus take reciprocal something inverse something get thing prof look familiar brad yes seen prof arrive famous sum natural see context zeta function call divergent series obvious way could possibly assign finite value sum infinite converge finite value context put value infinite sum context function actually way assign value riem ann riem ann said actually allow natural example series convergent allow also possible real number sand real also complex way get complex realizing within real find square root one way ban square root say n exist use mathematics understood long time ago actually much better way treat square root simply adjoin real real point line mark favorite example one half exactly middle way would third way also thing like square root example somewhere pi right real live root found anywhere line n give say know let actually draw plane let draw another system let mark square root new axis see every point plane becomes number would times square root times square root let find number intersection draw vertical line goes go also draw horizontal line point intersection point also would represent number would plus times square root word general number going call real part projection onto axis imaginary part projection vertical one notation little bit clumsy instead square root write iso example instead writing square root write plus imaginary number imagine find real line imagine adjoined imagination real comprise point real line axis complex comprise point brown paper could extend brown paper way infinity right let go back riem ann insight said look let think argument zeta function number initially thought could actually real number right number number actually case assign value divergent series goes infinity anything right drawing marking red function actually well defined said actually think complex number instead thinking point line take anywhere convergent right line see line sort right line live complex real part greater turns easy show anywhere shaded area except line right value area function converge put riem ann zeta function get convergent series right get convergent series converge something going real number g oint complex number going add infinitely many complex certain number closer closer approximate das go along sum ming far basically everything right line us fide come play come play give us fide imaginary part go negative imaginary part yes imaginary part negative positive real part greater context theory function complex argument sand call holomorphic function special nice one kind call holomorphic function enjoy call analytic continuation extend definition ie domain definition function method allow enable us kind push boundary kind go expand domain function seminal paper riem ann precisely extend function possible value except one one value nothing somehow call pole singularity value value actually somehow bad point sense point extend component imaginary right point actually real number funny would think sense easier better function perfectly well defined well defined singularity luckily singularity mean particular way assign value word value zeta zeta mean extended function function analytically continued whole complex plane value sense people say could regularize sum assign value show value zeta function naively supposed get getting value much sophisticated procedure starting function complex argument extending beyond initial domain matter number pluck feed function get number sort get well defined number uniquely defined number calculate computer number integral example explicit formula calculate calculate get result ambiguity point well defined point like achill es heel weak achill es heel good way put achill es heel function important responsible lot thing happening important point riem ann hypothesis following zeta function word question value zeta one million dollar question value function equal riem ann one point one make sort obvious happen value example equal equal word even negative reason happen see example function equation easily value going obvious speak already know question else else actually easy see concentrated one strip one side strip vertical line vertical axis side strip line real part let cal led critical strip complex real part inside critical strip middle line real value look real part example half plus five point somewhere line riem ann number minimum possible concentrate along critical line according riem ann hypothesis still n proved hypothesis function lie line except lie vertical line goes point exactly statement riem ann one way disprove hypothesis would find zero somewhere blue shaded know going blue shaded area question whether one specific line believe lot people looking counter example way one win million dollar one prove riem ann hypothesis disprove somebody could find point line also win one million lot people searching n able lot found line huge number n remember think found line constantly search going way like esoteric problem actually case meet eye riem ann amazing paper wrote also behaviour zeta function cal led riem ann zeta function specifically behaviour location function direct bearing distribution prime number sand prime incredibly important prime know something people study ing millennia right riem ann able connect function distribution prime number sand beautiful formula tell many prime say million n n zeta function absolutely astonishing think zeta function something complex analytic continuation forth particular branch mathematics cal led complex analysis prime live different branch mathematics number theory big surprise actually two thing closely connected relation riem ann found predicate riem ann hypothesis predicate knowing critical line riem ann hypothesis important know riem ann hypothesis hold obtain deep result distribution prime riem ann hypothesis riem ann hypothesis riem ann hypothesis
