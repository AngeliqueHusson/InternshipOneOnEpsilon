natural base lower case e constant defined e equal natural base often used model continuous growth continuous decay exponential function base e natural base exponential function example graph natural based exponential function equal e x also natural logarithm logarithm base e natural logarithm see written two different ways either log base e x simply l n x usually see l n x basically opposite natural base exponential function e x red equal blue
