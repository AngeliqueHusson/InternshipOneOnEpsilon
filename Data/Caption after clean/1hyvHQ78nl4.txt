want let say cosine five seven thing know right problem know cosine adjacent hypothesis right kind like kind forgetting given cosine know least write triangle say let say thats theta thats right name hypotenuse seven side going adjacent sides gon na five therefore dont know assets know could call b whatever want use going back well theta reserve anything leave one x gon na use thank zero squared plus b squared equal c squared right well term going use b squared use x anyways ill use five squared plus x squared want use b gon na use seven squared squared x squared equal x squared going take square root going equal square root cant negative cant negative distance correct giving positive squared get yes ill see simplify though radical probably wouldnt want say group number goes would root right ask us find six trigonometric function well already go sign two gave us know let sine opposite bit equal five seven tangent theta going opposite adjacent right root k next one reciprocal function either ill cosecant cosecant theta going equal gon na going hypotenuse opposite one root gon na rationalize denominator gon na want multiply root top get going times root times root times root right gon na thing secant gon na root need rationalize denominator multiplying trout bottom going root last one would hot math cotangent cotangent going rotated wrong opposite right think might see kay la secant seven coat stick cotangent look look cosine right secant seven five clement cotangent root six find six trig might make question especially looking phone looking yep give custom stop know like degree double doesnt give angle give like kind use right dont worry degree degree yeah one give like angle create right triangle thats funny
