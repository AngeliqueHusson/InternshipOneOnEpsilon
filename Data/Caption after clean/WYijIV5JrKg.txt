going talk opposite infinity opposite infinity minus infinity something thing ever thing could quite zero close st thing zero cal led infinitesimal even thing something make feel bit uncomfortable idea controversial long time mean thousand people like people hate infinitesimal would number possible close zero possible would something bigger zero smaller let say r real number smaller everything else slightly uncomfortable two less b always number fit let call c always something fit prove c could b divided two proven always something slip two matter close think ca n slip something else idea next number zero make intuitive sense mathematically alarm bell ring always problem people use solve problem like let say circle want know area one way could take circle could split meant small thin wedge moment problem going pretend triangle snow wedge pretend triangle mean straight base thinner closer would triangle kind say well let pretend really really slim like base infinitesimal really slim slim possible take circle triangle sand kind unwrap like hand fan know take hand fan shoo like first triangle take first triangle bottom take second triangle still connected kind though look like take next triangle bit look like take next triangle right take triangle si stretch connected cent like get really really thin turn right actually turned triangle see see triangle done drawing bad see triangle triangle slim triangle area begin perimeter different area area triangle half base times height got area big triangle made height altogether radius circle rand length base circumference circle area triangle half base circumference height radius area triangle circumference two pi r right half times two pi r circumference times rand get pi r area circle get right formula area circle splitting thin bit sand kind together clever idea guy came idea know guy worked elliptical interested working ellipse something make feel uncomfortable though always small error n mean saying triangle wedge always problem people always n quite yeah curved mathematician mathematician infinitesimal saying well really close zero ignore mathematician saying well han g ca n ignore might close ca n ignore problem people yet seem worked show different idea used right throwing money around rich throw penni es around yes idea got stack penni es meant two cylinder right took one star ted mess bit n cylinder something like tha tokay cylinder idea mathematician said took compare slice slice slice cross sectional area like area penny say volume cylinder cylinder compare slice slice instant instant volume slice n depth n volume cross sectional area cross sectional area kind like cross sectional n depth zero thing zero depth add get volume something would compare two like instant say volume idea going around well infinitesimal really important newton star ted use discovered calculus massive subject math really important seventeenth century discovered calculus trying work area curve right let try work area curve could could take curve want find area underneath could split thin strip sand saying strip like rectangle turned rectangle get little bit error thinner rectangle smaller error add rectangle find curve something mathematician newton might use different colour chop let say little let make different colour base rectangle something small infinitesimal perhaps call delta actually traditional notation let saying curve call curve thing like f x saying x going x delta x plus little bit width base delta work area way x delta let take area way x delta subtract green bit less x subtract area x equal area strip strip sand area strip f x height little base put another way could say function area x delta minus area x divided delta function rate change might sound bit abstract big discovery newton made actually hugely important mean could work area working rate change rate change something could newton working time knew works kind newton three year later principia big debate came got really nasty newton really wan ted protect discovery almost could n argue end set committee work discovered calculus newton friend newton wrote report know discovered newton came discovery guess taken away discovery taken away historian loo ked note sand decided came completely independent get credit infinitesimal sit problem newton knew well always little bit error n quite work end two hundred year later star ted tidy got rid realize n need use new idea cal led could get thinner thinner thinner would approach zero cal led limit mathematically rigorous consistent meant n use infinitesimal work area sand could thrown theory infinitesimal real gone made comeback ca n keep good idea made another comeback century took til century made another big comeback guy worked system could include could mathematically rigorous consistent system solve problem system guy cal led could century require mathematics done twentieth century took real added infinitesimal already infinitesimal n exist real added said infinitesimal something right something less real bigger zero added idea addition cal led got infinitesimal let call e infinitesimal also infinite system one infinitesimal infinite included two infinitely close together said x close together mean x minus yis infinitesimal idea infinitesimally close system real zero infinitesimal real know would never would one divided zero infinity would never still true true real still true true real number sand true either something like x plus equal plus x true real true x squared greater x x bigger one true real true hyper real know equal x true real true hyper real infinitesimal infinitesimal two times infinitesimal three times four times n times different infinitesimal different thing lots one infinitesimal lots nice little quote guy get mind quote read want get thinking thinking infinitesimal make work use system finally consistent rigorous used properly used solve problem cal led nonstandard analysis people fan system say intuitive say solve problem shorter proof sit finally made another comeback divided k even real nonzero element k certainly zero nonzero take reciprocal divide opposite infinity opposite infinity opposite infinity
