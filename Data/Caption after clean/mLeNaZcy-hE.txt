hi welcome math antic sin geometry lesson gon na learn may remember lesson polygon triangle special always sides angle sand word triangle mean tri mean angle mean easy enough sides else know triangle swell gon na learn classy triangle laughter seriously two different way organize classified sides classified start triangle v e already learned lot angle previous may remember first video angle type right angle acute angle obtuse angle swell watch happen third line form closed shape sah triangle sand guess three different kind triangle one made right angle cal led right triangle one made acute angle cal led acute triangle one made obtuse angle cal led obtuse triangle simple enough notice three new angle formed closed shape sare acute triangle always least acute angle sand angle type important know get given triangle see one acute angle doesnt mean acute triangle look angle tell acute triangle situation easier right obtuse triangle one right obtuse angle per triangle soon spot one kind know type triangle alright triangle angle pretty simple also triangle sides pay close attention length side triangle see three three sides triangle exactly length call equilateral triangle kind long word easy remember like word equal see second possibility let take top vertex equilateral triangle move like see two triangle sides got amount bottom side triangle equal sides cal led isosceles triangle long word best way remember look isosceles triangle say name times fast isosceles isosceles isosceles isosceles isosceles isosceles finally see third possibility let move top vertex time left sides different type triangle cal led scalene triangle three triangle sides equilateral triangle equal sides isosceles triangle equal scalene triangle equal sides way pretty easy part remember ing name sand know ways triangle let see use together yep use time triangle angle turns theres several possible see mean let list three classification sides scalene isosceles three classification angle right acute obtuse scalene triangle also right triangle like one scalene triangle also either obtuse acute triangle way isosceles triangle also acute like one obtuse like one one special case isosceles triangle also right triangle like thing different comes equilateral triangle equilateral triangle always acute triangle three sides exactly three angle must also exactly since one right angle triangle one obtuse angle angle equilateral triangle must know triangle classified let learn one really important thing triangle sin video angle degree learned measure angle say big small special cal led degree swell since triangle always made angle measurement degree sand important thing three angle combine always add example look triangle take saw cut three separate angle take three angle rearrange right next like see total would straight angle degree sand work matter type triangle knowing triangle angle always add degree really help geometry whole lot situation l l know two angle need figure third angle like problem triangle told one angle degree sand degree third angle unknown need figure since know total must add angle know subtract degree see left leftover amount must measurement unknown angle degree sand take subtract get degree left mean unknown angle degree sand always check answer angle make sure get see important know triangle angle add degree swell going learn triangle video remember key really learning math sure practice exercise section always thanks watching math antic sand l l see next time learn
