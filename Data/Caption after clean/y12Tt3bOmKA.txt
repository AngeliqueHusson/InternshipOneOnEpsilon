going talk today set positive set basically collection positive integer going try add set together let say set thats cal led well write notation ill give example set let another example well call b well say b want add two set together mean going add number set pairwise ill say plus b equal plus plus plus plus plus plus right new set would like write sum actually know set let say well repeated would like write set actual form struck repeated another thing worth set member set b member set sum plus b member something come think special type set ill call arithmetic progression arithmetic progression could p equal add time number progression cal led arithmetic progression added well well add p well see happen something kind interesting kind happen plus plus large set sum fact actual set much smaller brad thats final thats final set brad came lot didnt normal set come much normal set integer add sum saw lot sum case maybe theres much overlap case something close originally whole large grid sum nice thing arithmetic progression added size sum set less two times size original set sum set never double size original set end size p plus p always less equal times size thats special another example get pretty much exact opposite size p plus p actually closer would expect overlap gon na next geometric sequence ill call g time set squared cube ill add g geometric sequence whats special geometric sequence pairwise sum overlap overlap dont overlap much case arithmetic progression size g originally size size g plus g equal brad thats doubled yes definitely double right size g plus g greater times size g take really large geometric sequence would actually see g plus g g squared first thing result pau l little bit sum set let say take set define notion set sum free mean sum free mean take pair set number add sum pair set let look plus see two set sum free brad sum free set common like special rarity like prime sum free set easy find would think would maybe uncommon fact theyre actually common would imagine let say set set positive integer pau l said exist subset arbitrary set picked sum free subset greater third size original set yeah favorite set let say inside interval real let say interval real brad dealing integer dealing integer set real would like guess construct something thats cal led cantor middle third set iterative process first step cantor middle third set take middle third interval find middle third goes one third two third erase segment interval left set brad still infinitely big yeah mean count element set huge uncountable second step take middle third segment left take third set third end something little smaller infinitely many times suppose last limit set end cal led cantor middle third set brad never get would ever get well approximate basically say know thing get close enough take arbitrarily large step progression close st set limit brad many cantor middle third set well uncountably many sense know say havent taken size point way measure much weve taken away general well say interval suppose line want measure dimension interval say dimension right dimension like dimension piece paper well actually right thickness fantasy world right dimension right dimension line interval theres way measure dimension cantor one third set ill say ill call dimension quotation ill say dimension cantor set log log brought mathematical science research institute sri thats building behind place many world top mathematician come together sometimes semester time cracking problem mathematics youd like find put links description video
