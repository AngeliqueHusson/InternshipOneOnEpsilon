welcome another video something expert among aware pretty much every single video math made every even sneak little theorem proof video one want show today new beautifully visual ways prove small integer root like root well really cool closely related mathematical gem based usually refer triangular square hell triangular square well definitely click bait mean triangular square equilateral triangle made equilateral triangle like triangular square number triangle always square namely total width term triangle squared case width big triangle triangle claim exactly squared equal triangle prepared nice animated proof case general ready go yeah getting squarish done squared incredibly beautiful proof dont agree theres something really really really wrong probably time switch non math channel also hi ding around corner theres beautiful stuff good pass let savour go irrational note triangular square consecutive odd one yellow triangle first layer three orange second layer plus plus plus sum first five odd five squared general triangular square prove sum first n odd n squared also super beautiful anyway follow need remember triangular square width n contain n squared triangle want use triangular square prove square root irrational number root written fraction ratio prove let assume fact possible express fraction let also assume b small possible squaring sides give course squared equal thats saying b squared plus b squared plus b squared mean mean root rational equation x squared plus x squared plus x squared equal squared would positive integer solution b squared plus b squared plus b squared equal squared would solution would also mean combined three green triangular square width b would contain exactly number triangle triangular square grid width right would mean left would fit exactly large grid right super stylish way begin attempt fit pretty anyway attempt result three dark green triangle overlap empty triangle patch middle patch overlap would also triangular square right however since enough three dark green overlap triangle together must exactly fill white triangular grid thats absolutely impossible supposedly star ted absolutely way express square sum three square one course solution smaller one well weve game couple times already last couple video way resolve contradiction conclude assumption namely root fraction false word root irrational equivalently equation x squared plus x squared plus x squared equal squared solution slick similarly stunning triangle choreography also show root root root irrational let hammer crux proof contradiction one time root fraction equivalent three identical another triangular square right us showing really possible would possible even smaller triangular let see prove root irrational root fraction equivalent two identical triangular square triangular square like make contradiction work simply show equality another equality even smaller triangular square capture smaller triangular chase pretty pretty pretty nice point dark green overlap would exactly large white empty area let shift overlap would fill empty area create new overlap two smaller triangular square another triangular square contradiction prove root irrational little puzzle puzzle another look picture see even easier way arrive contradiction see two small triangular square add one large triangular square really jump ing see whether see let show root five six actual square first root triangular square another triangular square go music must agree two thing move root root show irrationality one actually also make sure various animation always exist size leave filling detail another puzzle root particularly tricky pin example pentagon root choreography even clear square consider filling detail puzzle check write description video long time fan may remember early days channel video proving root simple square choreography fact beautiful proof mathematician great star ted whole line investigation paper expanding idea step hen miller avid discovered root root pentagon contribution triangular square root illustrate thing anyway start much really really beautiful mathematics nearest miss solution impossible equation best rational approximation small really nice paradoxical insight triangular finish thing well let go remember proving root irrational proved equation x squared plus x squared plus x squared equal squared positive integer solution mean three green triangular square together white triangular square used proof actually number triangle sin fact chose left right close form want call nearest miss solution equation x squared plus x squared plus x squared next best thing integer solution among mean extremely good approximation root root counterpart look pretty good right run choreography start propeller formation triangle finish dance end another propeller formation even better new triangular square correspond another nearest miss solution one let unleash choreography small propeller yet another propeller another nearest miss solution one clearly something goes wrong try one time ill leave yet another puzzle figure cant go forever one direction let go way let run choreography reverse go everything going reverse back star ted stop keep going righto kay one step probably surprising hard show new propeller also correspond nearest miss like pan like check really true fact hard prove keep going well always get nearest miss solution fact get nearest miss equation way anyway list nearest miss solution take ratio top bottom give better better approximation root let check many get correct fact sequence root combine propeller contain ing ratio one large picture sense overall picture root root ever seen root pretty right youve probably already everything said root also shown work root root root fun picture root corresponding original choreography also super pretty right footnote really add second type nearest miss solution irrationality integer root general pell equation interesting connection infinite continued fraction interested ill put footnote description video finale video let tell freaky alternate number reality triangle applied well paradoxical puzzle pop context look call triangular triangle well nobody universe except going stop right puzzle figure motivation behind strange name hard anyway hexagon triangular triangle width n cal led nth triangular number hint n plus equal plus equal nth triangular number n sum first n positive integer many know equal n times n plus example number hexagon triangular triangle equal like integer square triangular also feature prominently number theory lot proved theorem example one famous gauss mathematical notebook say every positive integer sum three triangular gauss really excited found proof look eureka really bold letter preceding statement important us related fact square instance three times triangular number triangular number example plus plus equal let unleash root choreography setup see obviously correspond smaller triangular number sum also works one plus plus equal fact run choreography forwards backwards generate instance three identical triangular another triangular number nowheres main puzzle forget smaller equation follow one right doesnt prove case triangular square three identical triangular add another triangular number thats tricky one let see whether anybody figure anyway today
