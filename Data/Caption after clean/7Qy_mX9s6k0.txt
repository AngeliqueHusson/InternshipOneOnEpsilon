oh class work thats thats practice ladies tal ked theres tal ked two tal ked sum interior angle n minus two times polygon measure one interior angle n minus two times n right problem say one angle worth measurement formula think going want use sum measure one angle thus measure one angle give measurement one angle going worry theres telling us pretty much measure one angle equal going say right equal n minus times divided n theyre us find sides represent sides n represent number sides right need solve n going back algebra class variable get variable isolated right well first thing need need get denominator get denominator inverse operation use amber n ill ill multiply n sides therefore n minus times degree n divided n goes apply distributive property therefore n minus variable sides get variable get variable sides go add subtract get side usually like late gentle men know subtract subtract get side thats ill subtract n therefore thats going give negative equal negative yes theres could subtract add side theres problem either doesnt doesnt one way really choose ill divide negative therefore anybody anybody well step times would times n equal every individual angle equal degree equal degree name five sided figure pentagon good positive negative
