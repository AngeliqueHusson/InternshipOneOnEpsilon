working function contain following x value ask us function linear nonlinear linear function way tell given change x change always going value example one step change x change always going always going always going value dealing linear function change x x always since x always change always dealing nonlinear function actually show plotting x going different value went want divide change change x always constant fact let write something linear change change x always constant example change x sare always right go example change x always going order function linear change needs constant going take divide let see change constant go go go go already see constant n go time went go going actually going increasing amount definitely dealing nonlinear function see graph let draw rough graph let make vertical axis go way little bit granularly could value go axis right obviously exact scale let plot first point x x thats right x thats right x right x right finally x right immediately see tracing linear function point would line look something like cal led linear function case nonlinear rate increase x going linear function linear equation function grade khan academy linear function linear equation function grade khan academy linear function linear equation function grade khan academy
