ked graph equal log base x remind us saying saying equal power raise get x write logarithmic equation exponential equation exponent raise base x get raise th power another way writing equation would th power going equal x thing function x x function theyre really saying exact thing raise th power get x put logarithm saying well power raise get x well raise get raise five get x way let make little use plot point sand connect dot see curve look like let pick x sand general want pick give us nice round answer nice fairly simple us deal get calculator general want pick x value power raise get x value pretty straightforward power another way think could think different want raise power could get x could actually think one come actual x want clear express like independent variable x dependent variable might look one pick nice even nice x give us nice clean answer actually going fill first get nice clean let say going raise let say going raise going picksome new colors negative negative power let colors negative one little nontraditional filling dependent variable first way weve written actually given dependent variable easy figure independent variable needs logarithmic function x give negative x give x equal negative negative power going equal x negative get go back ear lier say log base power raise get raise negative power could say negative equal saying exact thing let another one happen raise negative get one fifth go original one saying log base one fifth want careful saying power raise order get one fifth well raise negative power happen take get one relationship saying log base power raise get raise next two happen raise first power well get go look thats saying log power raise get raise first power finally take squared get look logarithmic point view say well power raise toto get raise second power took inverse logarithmic function wrote exponential function switched dependent independent derive nice clean x give nice way want remind could picked random would probably gotten less clean would use calculator reason get nice clean result plot hand let actually graph actually graph thing go negative x go way let graph axis like start get positive positive negative negative x axis positive ill let think whether domain well think logarithmic function defined x positive power raise five get could raise five infinitely negative power get small number never get theres power raise get x theres power could raise get another negative number x also negative number domain function right relevant want think domain x greater zero let write domain x greater going able graph function positive way x get large let graph put point let plot first one blue x negative x going really close negative going like right quite right pretty close thats right comma negative right x one fifth slightly right one fifth negative right one fifth negative x might right point x x covered five thats point finally x graph function ill let color ill use pink x get super super super super small goes negative infinity get really small get x x becomes say power raise toto get negative power going negative approach kind move like start kind curve right like thing right going keep going steeper steeper rate never going quite touch going get closer closer never going quite touch
