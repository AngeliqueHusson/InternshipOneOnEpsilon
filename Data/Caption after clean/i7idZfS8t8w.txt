video going expose maybe one least top five useful formula seen many video know big fan recommend memorize caveat also remember prove n want remember thing know came said let show talking quadratic formula might guess solve root quadratic let speak general term ill show let say equation form ax squared plus b x plus c equal recognize quadratic equation b c well coefficient x squared term second degree term b coefficient x term c could imagine coefficient x zero term constant term given general quadratic equation like quadratic formula tell us equation x equal negative b plus minus square root b squared minus know seem crazy convoluted hard memorize right get lot practice actually pretty reasonable formula stick brain someplace might say gee wacky formula come next video going show came want get used first really came square equation right complete square actually going get solution quadratic formula right let apply problem let start something could verify giving us answer let say x squared plus equal situation let different color equal right coefficient x squared term b equal coefficient c equal negative constant term let plug formula get get x tell us x going equal negative b negative b negative put negative sign front negative b plus minus square root b squared b squared right squared minus times times c negative put negative sign cancel like since first time let skip many negative see fit simplify hopefully get x equal negative plus minus square root let see negative times negative going give us positive plus let see times plus nice nice perfect square going equal negative plus minus could divide term right equal negative divided negative minus divided tell us x could equal negative plus x could equal negative minus negative quadratic formula seem given answer verify substituting back work could even try factor right say two take product get negative take sum get positive get x plus times x minus equal negative times negative negative minus positive would get x plus sorry negative equal get x plus equal x equal could equal negative x could equal definitely give us answer factor ing might say hey bother crazy mess reason want bother crazy mess also work problem hard factor let couple let problem right let scroll get fresh real rewrite formula case havent memorize yet x going equal negative b plus minus square root b squared minus supply another problem let say equation squared plus equal negative first thing want get form term left hand side sides equation get squared plus plus equal use quadratic formula let apply equal b right c quadratic formula tell us equation root quadratic function guess could call x going equal negative b b negative plus minus square root b squared b get squared minus times c stretch radical little bit times get x equal negative plus minus square root minus interesting minus times minus times times minus interesting might already realize going simplify minus make become going equal negative plus minus square root positive minus minus going negative might say gee crazy silly quadratic formula sal worthless give square root negative number giving answer reason giving answer least answer might want real solution future going introduce something cal led imaginary number square root negative number actually express actually solution involve imaginary actually real solution taking square root negative number b squared b squared minus term right negative going real solution sand let verify let get graphic calculator let graph equation right let get graph equal squared plus plus equation going see equal let graph notice thing comes goes back vertex sitting x axis never intersect point expression function equal point equal graph quadratic formula seem working let one example never see enough example want know maybe obvious factor let say get negative squared plus plus equal let try quadratic formula x satisfy equation going negative b b negative b negative plus minus square root b squared b squared minus negative times c times times negative negative going equal negative plus minus square root negative times negative cancel plus right plus negative suspect simplify could maybe bring thing radical sign let attempt let prime factorization part simplify ing radical thing times thing times times square root equal square root times could say square root times times square root obviously going square root square root times square root properly times look like right simplify negative plus minus square root negative divide numerator denominator maybe equal negative plus minus square root negative could separate two term could say equal negative negative minus square root negative right right cancel divided get notice plus use minus sign plus become negative negative become positive still doesnt matter right could say minus plus thing plus minus square root nine think simple get want make clear point last step forget negative said n going turn positive negative going turn negative positive let rewrite right written plus square root negative minus square root negative right plus minus mean could really situation negative turn square root right taking negative negative negative become positive get plus square root right negative times negative positive plus minus square plus minus square root equation right verify curious graph look like let look let clear clear button negative three squared plus plus let graph let see intersect goes back plus minus square see square root going little bit right squared going little bit going little bit little bit divided little bit going get one value little bit another value little bitless look like case value pretty close another value little bit look close maybe little bit less anyway
