f x negative increasing concave anti derivative function big f one following decreasing concave decreasing concave increasing concave increasing concave begin definition anti derivative function big f x anti derivative small f big f prime x equal small f x notice given information f x think information big f prime x big f x anti derivative f x derivative equal small f x begin told f x negative mean big f prime x negative sign first derivative function increasing decreasing big f prime x negative big f x would decreasing f x negative equal big f prime x big f decreasing remember goal indicate true big f x next told f x increasing well f x increasing f prime x would positive f prime x positive big f double prime x would also positive f prime x equal big f double prime x know positive second derivative concavity second derivative big f positive mean big f x would concave second derivative less zero negative mean big f would concave also told f x concave well f x concave mean second derivative f actually third derivative big f would negative information actually answer question know big f decreasing concave therefore answer first choice decreasing concave finish sketching possible graph big f x big f decreasing know x increase function must go downhill left right function concave must resemble least piece graph look like function decreasing resemble left side graph thats concave big f x could look something like notice function decreasing concave hope found helpful
