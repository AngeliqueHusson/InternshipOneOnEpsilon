video want talk graph ing quadratic function simple example little check list usually thing run know produce rough sketch quadratic function assuming quadratic standard form everything basically ax squared plus b x plus c quadratic need need x squared term equal recall parabola open upwards ava lues positive open value negative find vertex either know highest point parabola point parabola use formula negative b give us vertex plug function get find either factor easy factor use quadratic formula get intercept simply plug function let one x squared minus minus n see coefficient front x squared understood since coefficient x squared term well greater parabola open upwards open upwards know theres going kind lo west point parabola second thing going n particular order going find vertex vertex negative b formula number front x squared value case b value whatever front x make sure take b value case negative turns constant hanging dont need effect vertex well n say effect going effect vertex certainly affect value let careful say use formula negative b negative well negative take times value hey simply get say vertex going equal vertex plug back function get get value plug f squared minus minus minus look like negative say hey one end get value negative useful us well let give little room k third thing least order written find remember basically replace value equivalently f x equal zero take equation replace f x zero well solve equation equal x squared minus solve factor use believe one factor get x squared need x x look two multiply negative add negative positive believe work set piece equal set x minus equal give us x intercept part factor equal get x equal negative mean case two really think vertex fact opening upwards two lee think mean two think geometry see know going negative last thing simply get intercept pretty easy get intercept let x equal plug x well get squared minus times minus look like value negative know make little sketch stuff know want need point know plug couple extra give extra value graph first thing going plot vertex say go one unit nine rough sketch counting anything like know intercept negative eight k actually found fourth step know goes negative know know x axis also negative based saw going put well pretty much play connect dot remind opening upwards try make kind curvy graph goes artistry best hey rough sketch vertex since goes x one cal led axis symmetry would say axis symmetry parabola line x equal one think know make sense x four away axis symmetry also negative two three away axis symmetry couple little observation make saying second ago know vertex since opening upwards knew find cross twice step x n find well know certainly done something wrong right hope simple example help question comment always feel free post graph ing quadratic function example graph ing quadratic function example graph ing quadratic function example
