welcome common unit algebra maybe course idea fitting exponential data gift problem following type supposed give say population size culture yeast something population p maybe day three culture weigh day weigh gram something student formula form p age b power system power data talk growth basically exponential model kind b right well way plug chug let year population times b cube went equal times b seventh solve know insight actually divide get divided b seventh divided b cube fourth leave b charming number power knowing kiss shove back formula work horrendous value guess done look completely ugly theres easy way fit expansion function data better write leave see let make data set little bit simpler first let population p suppose times day initial population gram one day goes factor easy trick p equal times check write put left p equal times equal left p equal initial time value straightforward easy answer right let goup oxidation difficulty time suppose two eight thirteen id slow factor four suppose take four days culture reach gram mean need modify formula make four time four behave like one well easy write eight times thirteen eight four check put put two equal zero yet p equal eight times thirteen zero x zero trick eight put equal four get four four yet making behave like one get eight times well well sit let go original data set let get back color pen better previous got factor factor want behave like zero theyre going modify formula way equal like zero well easy minus trick check put getting times whoops via put equal minus agent ace good exercise work way see really actually art look ugly turns algebraically guy let practice couple one example technique kind fun get han g pretty easy actually great think pedagogically step back find perspective know one great channel mathematics reduce everything easier problem see really easier problem disguise example suppose gave data set x dont know find exponential graph formula data well want equal behave like zero thing tobe factor must initial value thing factor want nine like zero even factor ill leave video couple exercise fun know teacher make practice easier first making unusual stuff told fit exponential function data also happen case suppose ked fit exponential function data zero happen case try play something something fun happen alright theres theres basic unit special nutshell thanks much
