right video going little introduction vector vector basically represent little arrow represent magnitude direction associated useful going talk magnitude point comma comma get component simply subtract subtract order important take finishing point minus starting point x put little bracket even bracket little arrow write magnitude vector v often times either make bold put little line indicate vector may accidentally forget put little line times hopefully context clear put even seen singlebar known magnitude length vector couple basic question going find component form magnitude two starting point one comma comma x x say get component form subtract take finishing minus starting thing minus calculate get five three component form specter kind think say well kind five right three kind another way think geometrically get magnitude call vector v get magnitude magnitude length vector two thing immediately use distance formula know distance formula subtract square subtract square add together square root equivalently sense already done finding vector form already get magnitude simply take component square square root going five squared plus three squared let see going would factor square root factor force ca n take root either really factor would simply leave magnitude square root got component form magnitude let thing example grab another sheet paper give little room thing find component form take notice point bottom wherever arrow pointing let minus negative minus well minus negative negative minus negative going component form maybe label vector well get magnitude vector simply square component add together square root distance formula plus like give us simply square root ca n really simplify much would magnitude would component vector introduction vector part introduction vector part introduction vector part
