brief introduction congruence like arithmetic remainder use certain bit terminology division course result remainder put take number divide number go certain number times something left put remainder program got name number divisor number dividing case dividend maybe aware term dividend number times goes word times take n q cal led quotient anything left p r remainder thing remainder conference respect number dividing signify divisor known modulus calculation provide remainder also known residue obviously mean leftover another piece notation remainder zero mean n annotation n vertical stroke e mean publication b course exactly example divided three take divided go five times give remainder one could see number respect n case equal meaning module meaning remainder respect division whatever say similarly pick another number like would go also remainder congruence come node another piece notation thats used far concerned two remainder end far remainder respect far module concerned give identical respect rate rate going equal congruent congruent respect division respect bracket afterwards would rate modulo nicely classic statement sand congress es two equivalent sense give remainder respect division could write congruent remainder residue less dividing number rating would congruent normally see moit actually modulo hey rule congress es take number congruent b mode number another number c congruent mode going b c n going tobe integer integer particular positive integer case three worth content b c mean far concerned division concerned would give remainder two look remainder different two general first one plus c word congruent b plus n necessarily need value effectively remainder sum equal sum addition subtraction box well addition subtraction principle multiple congruent multiple b remainder multiple equal multiple remainder multiplication times c congruent b times mode remainder product equal product remainder useful one one two remainder division power illustration first one addition subtraction principle remainder sum said difference equal sum difference remainder pick couple take take take division respect well go remainder thats congruent dividing remainder congruent would give congruent dividing exactly congruent tie principle add get addition remainder put current statement would case congruent congruent compare since taking well drop sum cognate sum remainder second one multiplying fixed number could combine one produce combination two instance could take three two would happen try congruent seize divided five confident mode five compare expansion say three times forty seven plus two course congruent times plus times whatever concurrent comes put congruent course divided take remainder result last one principle multiplication remainder product equal product remainder tested times congruent little bit divided congruent times concurrent times concur red mine one left debate multiplication principle would also extend two congruent x would equivalent multiplying power would congruent purpose power quite useful youd walk link become useful got something congruent one instance congruent different one mode name mean power n power cognate power n mean congruent power power n congruent one might lead little theorem e cognate b e n become going end change turn x want use n really useful congruent turns little number turns prime number take modulo p p prime e power p congruent e without power instance mark power divide remainder check ing power one seven seven one four seven dividing give four point two seven seven course recognize pattern name three remainder three course would take modulo something like name power well congruent prime number course would congruent way dividing power give result resulting remainder dividing give whole bundle point cent second citizeness remainder statement known fair little theorem e p minus congruent p n p cop rime little bracket stand highest common factor p cop rime n share factor highest common factor n p cop rime n share factor factor sin common n p cop rime mean e p minus congruent p little theorem useful instance something mode train name power one less plain number congruent check divide fact get handy thing course sometimes n got access become big congruence per raised polar congruent power remains useful one finding remainder huge example horse remainder power divided problem take see whether min power whoops gobbet many fit fit idea end actually divide divided still idea got end little theorem going come handy plain number going modulo threescore work fine mean three minus power congruent wynd use multiplication rule conference construct equal raised multiply another power continually conference behind congruent well congruent thats congruent multiply element deep type question remainder equal one example type question well use theorem also example conference congress es handy already going long enough probably make another video divisibility proving congress es congruence little theorem congruence little theorem congruence little theorem
