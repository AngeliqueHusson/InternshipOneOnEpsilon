brief introduction congruence like arithmetic remainder use certain bit terminology division course result remainder put take number divide number go certain number times something left put remainder program got name number divisor number dividing case dividend maybe aware term dividend number times goes word times take n q cal led quotient theres anything left p r remainder thing remainder conference respect number dividing signify divisor known modulus calculation provide remainder also known residue obviously mean leftover another piece notation remainder zero mean n annotation n vertical stroke e mean publication b course thats exactly example divided three take divided go five times give remainder one could see number respect n case equal meaning module meaning remainder respect division whatever say similarly pick another number like would go also remainder congruence come node theres another piece notation thats used far concerned two remainder end far remainder respect far module concerned give theyre identical respect rate rate going equal congruent congruent respect division respect bracket afterwards would rate modulo nicely classic statement sand congress es two equivalent sense give remainder respect division could write congruent thats remainder thats residue less dividing number rating would congruent normally see moit thats actually modulo hey rule congress es take number congruent b mode number another number c congruent mode going b c n going tobe integer integer particular positive integer case three worth content b c mean far concerned division concerned would give remainder two look remainder different two general first one plus c word congruent b plus dont necessarily need value effectively remainder sum equal sum addition subtraction box well theres addition subtraction principle multiple congruent multiple b remainder multiple equal multiple remainder multiplication times c congruent b times mode remainder product equal product remainder thats useful one theres one two remainder division power illustration first one addition subtraction principle remainder sum said difference equal sum difference remainder pick couple number swell take well take take division respect ill well wed go remainder thats congruent dividing remainder congruent would give whats congruent dividing exactly thats congruent tie principle add get addition remainder put current statement would case congruent congruent compare since taking well drop sum cognate sum remainder second one multiplying fixed number could combine one produce combination two instance could take three two would happen try congruent seize divided five confident mode five compare expansion say three times forty seven plus two course congruent times plus times whatever concurrent comes put congruent course divided take remainder result last one principle multiplication remainder product equal product remainder tested times congruent little bit divided congruent times concurrent times concur red mine one left debate multiplication principle would also extend two congruent x would equivalent multiplying power would congruent purpose power quite useful youd walk link become useful youve got something congruent one instance congruent different one mode name mean power n power cognate power n mean congruent power power n congruent one might lead little theorem e cognate b e n become going end change turn x want use n really useful congruent turns little number turns prime number take modulo p p prime e power p congruent e without power instance mark power divide remainder check ing power one seven seven one four seven dividing give four point two seven seven course recognize pattern thats name three remainder three course would take modulo something like name power well congruent prime number course would congruent way dividing power give result resulting remainder dividing give whole bundle point cent thats second citizeness remainder statement thats known fair little theorem e p minus congruent p n p cop rime little bracket stand highest common factor p cop rime dont share factor highest common factor n p cop rime dont share factor factor sin common n p cop rime mean e p minus congruent p thats little theorem useful instance something mode train name power thats one less plain number congruent check divide fact get handy thing course sometimes havent got access become big congruence per raised polar congruent power remains thats useful one finding remainder huge example horse remainder power divided problem ill take see whether min power whoops gobbet many fit fit idea end actually divide divided ill still idea got end thats little theorem going come handy plain number going modulo threescore work fine mean three minus power congruent wynd use multiplication rule conference construct equal raised thats multiply another power continually conference behind congruent well congruent thats congruent multiply element deep thats type question remainder equal thats one example type question well use theorem also example conference congress es handy already going long enough probably ill make another video divisibility proving congress es
