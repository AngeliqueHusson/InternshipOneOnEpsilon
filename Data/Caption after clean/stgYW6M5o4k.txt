music random walk ubiquitous inapplication mathematics search engine algorithm everywhere finance describe biological movement microscopic scale math behind music mathematician like take morning walk wood would regularly couple got thinking odds two randomly walking group bump answer going build rigorous understanding random walk random walk general type random process always involve taking series step direction determined see episode random walk take place many different setting according many different rule probably basic random walk integer let say start point zero flip acoin one side plus coin land plus move right one coin land move left one one turn probability plus probability standing minus turns chance standing minus chance standing plus chance zero three turns odds one fifth minus three minus plus let one time four turns odds plus minus plus two zero first odd turns random walk odd number sand even turns second mostly middle number longer flip coin mole spread random walk specific location begin form bell curve notice picture probability distribution hundred coin time minus general version statement n usually minus square root n plus square root n let introduce notation make second observation precise let fi indicate outcome coin flip outcome first coin outcome second soon si cal led variable n outcome fifty percent chance plus one fifty percent chance minus one average value f five calculate one half x plus one plus one half x minus one value zero actually flip coin f first three flip plus one minus one plus f plus f equal minus plus one let n integer add f plus f plus f way f n together get location walk n flip let call f n sum coin flip also random variable actually graph look like bell curve f plus chance minus location flip f plus f minus chance plus chance specific value slick first three flip sare plus minus plus f plus f equal minus plus equal plus equal plus average value n well sum first coin flip zero loo ked random walk integer whole thing works dimension example two dimensional integer lattice look like grid start origin point zero zero equally likely move left right arbitrary number randomly walking along ad dimensional integer lattice two times direction move since equally likely move direction times chance move specific direction pretty much everything weve said far still true still likely origin value many step distribution random walk look like bell curve distribution actually bell back polio question beginning odds two independent random walk quickly case random walk integer lattice odds random walk starting position two definition call random walk recurrent guarantee starting position call random walk transient positive probability starting position one two dimension random walk recurrent chance starting spot fact return infinitely many times answer polio question theyre walking along guarantee keep bumping random walk integer lattice three higher transient three four chance random walk escape never return starting spot intuitively kind sense higher dimension space random walk favorite joke drunk man eventually find way home drunk bird may get lost forever drunk man preferential direction equally likely move direction call simple random walk general random walk bias preferential direction let look one dimension instead fair coin coin p landing probability minus p landing p number p equal simple random walk looking p equal probability moving right sand probability moving left times likely move left right smaller p left bigger p mores right expect random walk hover near moving let similar computation find value one coin flip probability p coin flip plus probability minus p coin flip minus average value coin flip p minus n compute value sum value end slip n times p sake example let assume mean moving right chance moving left minus equal expect plus move expect plus moving right p minus like speed walk random walk n going move exactly feed fluctuate around average like simple random around zero speed walk similar n fluctuation around average similar square root n really two speed happening average speed moving like n speed around average like square root n want folk saw episode chain random walk example chain remember chain set state swith arrow connect ing told likely jump another episode chain finitely many random walk example infinitely many infinitely many integer state probability transition function given equation probability x x plus equal p probability jump ing x x minus equal minus p random walk sare everywhere integer lattice randomly walk graph like computer randomly walk basically go ogle search algorithm modify random walk integer plus minus whats known scan blur ruin model simple gambling game also use random walk model stock market endless number interesting random walk favorite let us know comment see next infinite series hey time annual digital react response got last year show ked show got want see tube upcoming year link description survey take fill randomly selected participant get excited hear thinking let talk response pick theorem formula finding area polygon swith vertices integer lattice first excellent correction say proof planar graph think step since loop single vertex need consider whether edge pick loop logic works fine contraction edge remove one edge one node fine loop contraction edge remove one edge one face still edge cancel argument subtly different two case thanks pointing method actually computer method computer find area polygon made curious anyone know computer find area polygon arbitrary shape finally meiosis drew attention shoelace formula also find area polygon neat way vertex weird crisscross pattern hence name shoelace formula go check see next time music random walk infinite series random walk infinite series random walk infinite series
