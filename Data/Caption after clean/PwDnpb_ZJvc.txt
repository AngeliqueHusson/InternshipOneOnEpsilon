let think little bit think first power going encourage pause video well let think definition exponentiation start multiply number times one literally going times let right color times multiplying one times well thats going equal think squared second power going equal well one way thinking start going multiply two times times times going well multiply anything times going get think see pattern take nonzero number power nonzero nonzero number going equal interesting question happen power millionth power going trillionth power going negative fractional exponent havent tal ked yet long theyre nonzero going equal kind make sense let think power actually fairly deep question give hint well actually n pause video think little bit power well two train thought could say look nonzero number n extend number sand say number maybe say power another train logic already learned nonzero number take nonzero number raise power already established start multiply times nonzero number times always going equal nonzero maybe say hey maybe extend maybe power could make argument power equal see conundrum actually really good case get actually fairly sophisticated really good case power mathematician get situation say well theres good case either completely natural one either definition would lead mathematician decided part find people dispute people say like one part left defined least kind conventional use case might defined one two nonzero number going get nonzero number power going get little bit question mark zero exponent radical scientific notation prealgebra khan academy zero exponent radical scientific notation prealgebra khan academy zero exponent radical scientific notation prealgebra khan academy
