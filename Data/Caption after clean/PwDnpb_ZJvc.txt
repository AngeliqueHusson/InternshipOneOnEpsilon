let think little bit think first power going encourage pause video well let think definition exponentiation start multiply number times one literally going times let right color times multiplying one times well thats going equal think squared second power going equal one way thinking start going multiply two times times times whats going well multiply anything times going get think see pattern take nonzero number power nonzero nonzero number going equal interesting question happen power millionth power going trillionth power going negative fractional havent tal ked long theyre nonzero going equal kind make sense let think power actually fairly deep question ill give hint well actually dont pause video think little bit power well theres two train thought could say look nonzero number dont extend number sand say number maybe say power another train logic weve already learned nonzero number take nonzero number raise power weve already established start multiply times nonzero number times always going equal nonzero maybe say hey maybe extend maybe power could make argument power equal see conundrum theres actually really good case get actually fairly sophisticated theres really good case power mathematician get situation say well theres good case either theres completely natural one either definition would lead mathematician decided part find people dispute people say like one part left defined least kind conventional use case might defined one two nonzero number going get nonzero number power going get thats little bit question mark
