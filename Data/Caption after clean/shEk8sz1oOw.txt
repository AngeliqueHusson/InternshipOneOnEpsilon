recent video equation anything look like x raised power graph thing solution root zero polynomial easily seen point plot x axis professor also sho wed us equation odd power must extreme point meaning point must cross axis polynomial odd degree least one root among may get little kink like great even polynomial example one well thats never going cross x axis mean strap thinking leading us towards one mathematics let doit going start equation equation even degree didnt root f x equal x squared plus one thats lost cause lost cause people probably hear square root famous mathematician sir say square root important single invention certainly solve equation claim root definition root polynomial oil havent got havent got find live time gauss pretty well understood think plane number scalled complex plane axes real axis complex one wont comfortable place ordinary arithmetic thing write number people usually use z reason complex z would certain real part certain imaginary part maybe b would write z equal sa real part plus b imaginary part complex multiply way think want multiply plus times minus multiply would algebraic expression x arithmetic plug complex number thing plane complex thing like z plug polynomial get another complex number multiply add thing also divide satisfy comfortable law arithmetic like times b times thing get comfortable arithmetic use polynomial might want separate source polynomial place exes live value place f x live going use red plane one draw like real axis imaginary axis let call imaginary axis real real axis pure imaginary without real part thing like squaring number example could square would record square instance polynomial f let use green polynomial f blue x red x squared instance f would squared definition minus one would would say sort point real axis f green line minus one point think taking point plane point plane want think root polynomial polynomial one take point point root point blue plane take zero point red plane right middle right middle right zero thats goal fundamental theorem algebra gauss id like word theorem forget exact date pretty happy gap scot wasnt pretty good yeah people always like say well cow thats much insult anyway theorem say polynomial complex coefficient scan spell coefficient yes polynomial least one complex root actually follow complex root multiplicity let say ha sat least one complex root talk fundamental theorem algebra basic connection algebra point somewhere theyre geometric object polynomial algebraic object connection make one without break geometry work make happy algebraic geometer give something interesting saying theres polynomial could concoct wouldnt able find root long complex number sin tool belt thats right except saying could find mim going show exist going find want actually find root descent thing numerical method powerful hard find root harder proving exist going prove exist cant trick trick thats lot like explain something multiply complex think complex number blue complex plane complex number think like think vector drawn origin think vector vector really length length cal led absolute value complex number z know theorem know length vector taking square real part plus square imaginary part taking square root z plus b absolute value z ill write magnitude cal led square root squared plus b squared theorem theres another thing need determine vector thats angle let call theta let say knew magnitude could compute sine theta cosine theta magnitude length sine opposite side hypotenuse would opposite side triangle imaginary part real part would cosine angle multiply thing multiply complex trick real imaginary part think something happening remember high school trigonometry certainly dont theres addition law cosine comes saying take two z w w take angle let call one multiply multiply length multiply magnitude sand add angle would take would add theta would get something way length would someplace right z times w really easy multiply complex multiply add angle add formula figure put going take ready go want take arbitrary polynomial nice paper want think going blue complex plane red complex plane say go video right two axes yes represent ing eat one axis axis want make real graph like need four dimensional space hard imagine four dimensional space want graph function want tell happen buy x want find point least convince point blue point go zero side thats want point going come going find point one exist prove start scratching head thinking dont know anything polynomial like know know leading term thats x n know big thats likely dominant hand x small something x zero seen know zero point blue plane goes c red planet nice red c let say c c complex number someplace plane know goes thats terribly helpful wan ted get point go go see get whale know know take x enormous ly large magnitude x end well magnitude power much much much bigger next mine n minus one really large way big big circle around x big magnitude magnitude x much bigger circle could argument could angle know x n even bigger going scale red plane dont draw table go huge circle happen take walk x think dog leash lead around circle know happen magnitude remember pretend ing polynomial x end like exeunt magnitude stay magnitude x end thing walk around circle real polynomial stay close sort dance around like dog would leash something else happening though move x around one move n times fast multiplying n actually goes around n times purpose proof enough good know goes around well see n important move around move around circle actually many times nice help obvious comes trick rest proof see know right going shrink circle point little little going watch right hand side right hand side circle remember real value function dancing around circle somehow nice continuous curve circle begin shrink know x zero small circle close c circle shrink uneven way end day form little circle around c x little circle around zero process somewhere circle pass origin thats catch root somewhere along line shrink see picture like thats point looking point maybe point small sort smaller circle function actually goes zero zero value said really goes around n times actually path going around n times shrink keep going around n times n curve move point one time maybe theyll actually n root thats full fundamental theorem algebra still watching video youve got sort attention span make think might enjoy hello inter net pod cast tuber grey sort thing often talk like making tube video youd like find check links ill put thing video description
