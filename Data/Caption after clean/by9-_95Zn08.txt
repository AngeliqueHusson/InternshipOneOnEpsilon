lesson going learn meant composite also going learn find area type shape example composite shape shape made rectangle triangle get area compound shape necessary break shape smaller part calculate area first find area rectangle use formula area times bread substitute length breadth formula six times five equal squared next find area triangle formula calculating area triangle area equal times base times height since dont know height triangle work height minus equal substitute value basin height formula times give answer squared area rectangle centimeter squared area triangle get area composite shape add area two together area composite shape plus centimeter second example composite shape shape made half circle rectangle need break shape smaller calculate total begin half circle remember formula calculating area whole circle area equal pi times radius squared calculate area half circle need first calculate area full circle divide answer example diameter centimeter radius circle centimeter area circle equal pi times radius squared remember want area half circle need divide answer giving area point three centimeter squared let area rectangle length rectangle centimeter height area rectangle equal length times breadth equal equal calculate area composite shape must add area half circle area rectangle three centimeter squared plus squared give us total area composite shape three centimeter example blue shaded area rectangle white circle hole cut middle find area composite begin finding area rectangle formula calculating area rectangle area times breadth substituting value length breadth area times equal squared next need find area circle diameter circle radius use formula area equal pi r squared times give answer point squared get area shaded part shape need subtract area circle area rectangle equal point lesson learned composite shape shape broken simpler part area composite shape found formula basic part subtract ing answer find total area
