thermometer science lab display temperature degree theyre giving us temperature corresponding temperature give us two formula know temperature figure temperature know temperature figure temperature actually derived learn algebra also maybe another video explain derive actually kind interesting involve little bit algebra gave us formula really want us apply maybe make understand one apply well giving us temperature right f going equal us temperature need figure temperature one know solve temperature let use right temperature going times temperature degree minus minus going equal times thing times even multiply times divide numerator denominator let divide numerator denominator divided divided becomes times degree sand want write number little bit sense term temperature let divide get number degree goes one times minus goes three times could bring another decimal point going get goes three going repeat could view equal keep little line top mean degree could say look goes remainder could say also equal remainder degree way works temperature temperature degree converting prealgebra khan academy converting prealgebra khan academy converting prealgebra khan academy
