right video going graph piecewise function piecewise function line parabola constant function going horizontal line let focus piece individually hence word piecewise function look blue one right let think equal negative x plus recall equal x plus b right negative slope number let go ahead plot axis slope negative think two different ways actually mean thing put negative either bottom going right want intercept right thing going one left right well left reason going explain piecewise function notice bunch dot want put never straight line let go ahead graph line want stop right reason want stop right look domain want use line x less equal negative well let look x value right x value negative negative let look x value right negative let look next value right negative negative x value along line less equal negative n need us graph want equal symbol see right want emphasize nothing special graph ing especially paper technique want emphasize equal want use closed dot tell n gon na erase make look nice clean leave want might want count wrong clean little bit keep mind line go forever direction x value move left line shoot way less equal negative blue line done let move parabola forgot grab parabola lucky us another technique help us plot point n want plug point like negative negative need waste time reason say look domain piecewise function want use parabola negative less x less equal mean want touse x negative let write negative negative gon na careful gon na come back one got plot let still plug one time start negative negative squared negative plug negative negative squared minus give negative square root minus negative plugging minus give plug squared minus negative plugging minus give let get plot ordered pair notice x first one since hope first one n want put closed dot notice n see equal symbol n want x equal negative still want emphasize ordered pair negative negative let use open circle n equal n like really use open circle n see equal symbol let plot rest negative negative negative right next one negative gon na right negative got right negative right making parabola n make look nice smooth nice curve best something like yeah make nice smooth good enough right parabola since n equal symbol x equal negative dot going open circle parabola nice smooth alright last piece equal seen video maybe class equal number want think hoy h stand horizontal going horizontal linelet look see equal axis equal also equal across also go way erase reason erase dot reason erase want line x bigger let get line line right going change color look nicely notice line well dont need us graph line look x x value right one two three want x equal three n see equal symbol therefore want emphasize first dot right right one two three want use open circle line wo n x strictly greater three equal open circle leave dot like remember draw horizontal line bam draw horizontal line notice like right x value let drop add one two three four five six guessing value three four five six seven eight nine ten goes forever bigger value dot line value equal piecewise function use closed circle equal symbol use n equal never hurt use could even use forget graph thought would good idea equal x plus b thing example function video hope graph piecewise function graph piecewise function graph piecewise function
