last video ran ted taxi driver almost hit crosswalk brake fast enough rain thinking problem ways stop crosswalk really decrease speed fast enough get hit ting crosswalk maybe really slope decreasing speed possible steep enough slope little deceleration people seeing last video pro tested use term deceleration deceleration even negative opposite speeding slow ing negative problem car separate mode forward reverse coming stop light dont slow car reverse hit brake sand slow stop brake want start going backwards back crosswalk like holding brake real hard deceleration speed car reach es zero negative go reverse brake reverse slow ing negative deceleration also known acceleration yep hit ting brake reverse actually speed positive direction really talking velocity speed velocity speed frictional attachment relative zero position earth friction based brake care thing like whether stopped hover car crosswalk instead brake brake youd hit reverse backwards would slow mean negatively care speed speed zero instead stopping hover car would keep reverse smoothly continue deceleration curve back crosswalk possibly far away come hover boardlike regular taxi hover car superior much smoother ride good driver avoid sort nondifferentiable know real life lots little going everywhere herem slope si always found weird youd get smoother ride kept hover car going backwards stop understand like drive hover car find helpful derivative oh mention care speed derivative position time art note pretty sure reason newton get credit invent ing calculus instead someone like hey newton like derivative differential calculus fancy decided memorize someone ked probably like like like slope si like thats goes head second derivative care driving control accelerate decelerate gas brake unless got fancy cruise control let directly input speed case sometimes work someday use self driving car put position want go calculate rest ah technology lowering derivative common good although going work directly position rather acceleration prefer straight like differentiable mode transportation mathematically beautiful choice vehicle narrowly avoid hit ting pedestrian look smooth flat deceleration create sa constant sloping downward speed goes right stillness continue backwards mean position time approach crosswalk back away perfect smooth curve parabola whenever buy hover car always check range second derivative powerful mean steeper first derivative got calculus
