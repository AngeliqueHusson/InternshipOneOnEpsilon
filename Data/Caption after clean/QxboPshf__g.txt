video one example multiplying dividing complex given us polar form actually quite bottom one n going given us polar form well bottom problem weve got three plus cosine plus sine degree write number polar form write z equal r cosine theta plus sine theta get r remember take real part square add imaginary part squared square root three plus three went ahead real quick plus well get r value would simply take three squared plus three squared well going always write times pull square root would left root value r figure value theta think making little right triangle well adjacent side height also link opposite side say tangent theta would opposite adjacent excuse tangent degree going equal let see think rewrite numerator say would thing r value said root root times cosine angle said degree cosine degree plus times sine even write one times cosine sine degree weve seen example dividing simply divide subtract angle case take root times square root cosine minus degree plus times sine degree minus degree point basically got solution always clean little bit root cosine negative degree plus sine negative degree think would stop leave need one set parenthesis leave got polar form new number perform division complex multiplying dividing polar form ex complex multiplying dividing polar form ex complex multiplying dividing polar form ex
