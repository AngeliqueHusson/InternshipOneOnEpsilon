let talk four color theorem favorite mathematician sit easy state statement every map colored four colors two neighboring different colors would wasnt map done four word saying map need five obvious think complicated map would need colors apparently map done four colors problem unsolved long year unsolved solve finally although method used solve little controversial time large effect mathematics today story problem came around kind cute apparently guy trying color n know trying suspected could four brother brother math student brother lecturer man cal led august us de morgan famous mathematician well de morgan spread problem around prove either need show every map done four colors better need find one example needs five colors people trying try map work try map world color four colors try map united four colors try real map four mean get problem right want keep quiet start think well maybe need invent map maybe invent weird complicated map find one needs five colors start n look like sort real life map got map going color let start middle think orange next country different color purple try next country fairly simple ca n use purple ca n use orange touching use blue next one u h want want brad brad well ca n use blue orange r grime brad oh could use purple r grime ah wise wise choice let use purple let go expense fourth let one brad use blue r grime use blue one excellent might put us good position next country got ca n use blue ca n use purple use brad use orange r grime use orange u h wan na use orange opposite one one orange brad need fourth color r grime need go fourth color yeah yeah yep purple blue orange used go fourth color got pink opposite side obviously use pink look like use four colors map solvable four colors another important map gon na make like try color u h something similar orange middle purple well one ca n purple ca n orange mean blue country ca n orange ca n bepurple ca n blue forced touse fourth color pink example map definitely needs four colors going boil problem little bit let say took map ill draw map instead coloring section let say colorin center region get idea wo n use ink maybe instead drawing whole map maybe said two touching share right connect line made turn map network map made network question map colored four colors better question saying network colored four colors better two connected line color kind boil problem make abstract actually good thing easier solve learn map instead reason want use start two map ill show mean look like yeah map look like handbag told draw network map going dot region ill connect connected like find get network previous map give network effectively map even though look different study different kind map even look different map network show mean going valid map say going touching mutually share like got right look like going valid map try turn map going work problem cross try turn map doesnt make sense try n make sense untangle might happen show mean say let say touch well would connect line see cross n way could drawn line like could untangled untangle fine valid map map learn looking one particular map going country let scall country right going country every map thats either like country connected one country might happen country connected two get network like country middle might country connected seem perfectly reasonable center country could connected put country could connected every map one country look like one ca n every country connected six saying one country map thats either connected one two three four five map mutually connected six network ca n untangled map feature one one list start talking four color theorem actually going useful four color theorem hard prove tried long time like took year manage easier version four color theorem four color theorem map need five probably prove need seven colors thats probably easier explain go imagine map need seven colors map ca n done better right map pick one got small one map going contain country going one cal led list country pull delete take away made smaller map smaller map mean six colors remember map use seven take country away smaller doit six great put country aback mean spare color use mean worst case scenario last one could different colors put back still going color sixth color use show map done six colors show map done five colors little bit harder proof exactly proof exactly except end um becomes harder five different colors put country back might color n want argument bit complicated show recolor still spare color harder proof along try four show map done four colors argument n quite work n strong enough went unsolved long time people thought proved thought actually done people accepted proof thought solve decade thought oh done oh found actually n holdup oh n proved go back square one find way prove problem took till solve problem final solution done two guy ken neth university kind similar proof made list said every map must least one sho wed every one one colored four colors colored four colors enough every map done four colors hard proof apart problem show list could colored four colors long list many list sic used computer controversial time first computer assis ted proof mathematics commonplace lots mathematics done first people wary proof astart one problem lots case best kind proof proof valid problem n give understanding something true case mathematician necessarily like kind proof best kind still valid proof proof improve long list show could color got think like something think shorter sure short moment though proof massive check ing case still beautiful proof episode brought get ten percent first order going pretty much every day maintain sort thing line store sort great one setup everything right buy ing domain name start designing page got award winning template theyre really good tweak see fit course importantly look equally good mobile device taken care whatever next move line square space going make much easier also look much professional give really n matter days whether sort c v type site kind shop really need classy going get go check even free trial remember use get ten
