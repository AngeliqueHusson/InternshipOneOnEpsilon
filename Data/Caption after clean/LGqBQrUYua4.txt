hi welcome math antic lesson gon na learn long division already watched video basic division sure go back watch first make learning long division lot easier long division way breaking bigger division problem series short division step like basic division video nice thing long division know procedure divide kind even really big key long division think division problem dividend number dividing lot mean lot division step learned basic one step division dividend small enough could use multiplication table help us find answer division problem like divided definitely multiplication table fact anything even close well instead trying divide entire break problem smaller step trying divide digit one digit time remember multiplication addition always start digit place digit work right left well division backwards still go digit digit way start trying divide digit biggest number place first work way left right first step problem divide first digit dividend ignore make look like division problem divided great easy basic division problem like last video ask many take make almost well two would almost like put answer spot top line wait lot room exactly put well answer digit always go directly digit dividing since dividing digit go right times goes subtract get remainder minus remainder point basic one step division problem would rewrite remainder answer little next going yet long division still divide since going stop next digit dividend might think next division step divide quite simple remainder last division step forget need combine remainder next digit divide together copy next digit put right beside remainder look like remainder kind like remainder teaming next digit think make sense first division step really part remainder still need divide next digit make remainder bigger good remainder small divide divide ask many take make well three would really close without big put answer line yep goes right next digit dividing process times put right subtract get next remainder also see basic division procedure going screen alright new remainder time next division step stop last digit dividend bring copy team new remainder together form remainder ah ha good gon na easy divide multiple take exactly make put last place answer line write new remainder subtract see last remainder zero mean remainder left great solve whole division problem breaking three basic division step know divided equal also know call long division fact long think need coffee oh division problem three digit dividend also three division step number step always number number step also depend big divisor see mean work two division problem side side look like basic one step division problem last video see one actually two step problem start first problem divided ask many take make almost well easy multiplication table see multiple put answer line write see remainder try next problem divided ask many take make almost see answer multiplication chart biggest multiple three listed even close reason really two step problem try new method learned instead many make focus first digit ask many take make ah easy two would give us close put answer line right multiply times make subtract get remainder second bring copy next digit combine get new remainder ask many take make answer exactly write answer line remainder done divided interesting thing example first problem could two step problem also taken would first ked many take make almost answer would zero since big divide would put zero answer line remainder would basically skip ped step happen division sometimes number small divide put zero answer line move next digit know procedure long division ready see really long problem good thought divide really hard go gon na work problem pretty fast worry follow math focus division process go along ready first digit many times divide zero big skip step combine first digit next digit many times divide six times minus give us remainder third bring copy join remainder ask many times divide three times minus zero next even though previous remainder zero still bring copy next digit ask many times divide zero big need move next digit bring copy also better ask many times divide five times minus give remainder last digit zero might wonder even bring copy zero nothing zero important place bring copy remainder remainder big difference ask many times divide four times minus zero yes done divide see final answer procedure long division see complicated get discourage confused first like almost everything take practice get ready practice long division problem tip help first already done multiplication table really help division second working problem really important write neatly stay organized writing messy might hard keep column lined could lead mistake case try graph paper help keep thing lined third start smaller two three digit dividend division step work longer problem last practice problem check answer calculator let know right away made mistake correct importantly learn give practice calculator also important alright lesson thanks watching math antic see ya next time learn math antic long division math antic long division math antic long division
