thing actually trinity math society trinity college math society lecture mathematics go pub well society logoi square made square different sizes see one well mean unit unit square one square different sizes yet fit together make one big square cal led squared square picked society well yeah trinity math student solve one actually possible squared square something like would done ancient something like old problem make square square different sizes like classic problem n really turn century surprise integer square square twice cal led imperfect use rather different sizes four student trinity math society really solve problem cal led stone smith brook bill first three math tut te actually chemistry student math society n mathematician math society think stone brought problem hear problem thing done couple rectangle found made square snot quite thing two two rectangle nine ten easier making two found far student star ted find method little bit ad ho c trying find would get lucky find square made square chance n working kept trying found rectangle could n find square thought right going get star ted finding rectangle made thought let star ted extend horizontal like see horizontal line right extended gon na turn rectangle network connect two horizontal square touching one touching two horizontal top bottom gon na connect actually gon na draw arrow show top bottom mark square gon na whole thing network top sixteen bottom connect line mark line keep going turned network recognize went seem recognize minded electrical network connect battery network wire one unit resistance connect battery potential height rectangle put current flow electrical network suddenly realize connected electrical network sand could use math already could borrow completely solve squared square problem particular cal led law sa couple law current flowing point equal current flowing point let look current flowing flowing flowing got total flowing flowing got equal another thing learn got circuit like circuit circuit make zero show mean going got got make go opposite direction minus together whole circuit zero easy yeah math suddenly borrow could solve squared square problem couple thing solve way sho wed squared rectangle square two actually one squared rectangle meaning square sand one one done remember two done previously one small squared rectangle sho wed cube kind disappointing ca n make cube different sizes could find made valid squared rectangle sand valid squared without draw squared star ted build could find squared rectangle another squared rectangle dimension could like squared rectangle like another one completely different square inside mutually exclusive size could join together like would square would square would make squared square automatically ca n would n duplicate though want avoid want two squared rectangle square common looking maybe could one square common corner square could could rectangle like another one meant exactly dimension share one corner would make squared square well plan worked finally found one first squared square massive first one found used square sand star ted improve wan ted find smaller found one used tut te found one used getting better question squared square something struggle came hard problem problem left open another computer came along computer could use student method done could use method computer searching squared square found square sit definitely unique one squared square none use square sand look many student came mathematician swell one came civil servant still math think three came mathematician bill tut te star ted chemistry student swap ped math came park code breaker world war important came proper mathematician pioneer graph theory math credit problem training graph seen one squared square dimension actually smaller square tal ked use square unique either three known square size smaller dimension use thing found interesting theoretically one squared plus two squared plus three squared plus four squared imagine consecutive square going equal toa big number even sure well tell squared mean theoretically possible make square consecutive square one two three four ca n done tempting math look like done geometrically n fit together disappointing know like magic squared square perfect super perfect disappointing n exist favorite squared square say favorite one actually found trinity student found scooped everyone else like nice square tell mat seem excited know excited squared square squared square squared square
