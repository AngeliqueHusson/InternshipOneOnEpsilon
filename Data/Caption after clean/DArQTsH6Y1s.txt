proved isosceles triangle theorem need prove converse considered triangle given two angle congruent given given measure angle bis equal angle c thats supposed prove supposed prove c equal b mean sides opposite also equal take generally prove pair sides pair look congruent triangle sand use correspondence one triangle case make two triangle bit construction let think different form two triangle draw ad like form two prove congruent sides c b corresponding part turn also equal come crucial part video line draw remember line use form two triangle way help us congruence special mean either median angle bisector perhaps altitude different ad median b would equal c ad common side triangle anger equal angle c double sa enough prove congruence two triangle median say ad angle bisector angle make two angle equal case two angle triangle equal two corresponding angle side ad common triangle case aa surely suitable condition congruence basically drawn angle bisector angle zoom understand proof right hand side board proof really simple consider triangle triangle successfully prove two say c equal b know angle b equal angle c already given us angle b ad equal angle c ad got equation construction side ad equal ad common sight took triangle clearly case double triangle congruent triangle double congruence finally get c equal b corresponding sides congruent triangle write c corresponding sides congruent two angle triangle equal sides opposite also equal thats converse isosceles triangle theorem
