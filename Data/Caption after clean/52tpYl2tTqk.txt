hi rob welcome math antic sin algebra basic lesson gon na learn realm math word function simply something math word function specific meaning math function basically something connect one set another set particular set group collection thing soften collection set could collection thing like letter sometimes shown visually like often see set written common math notation member set put inside curly bracket comma like set finite infinite number example set contain ing letter alphabet set integer infinite number set collection thing function one set another exactly well understand function work help start naming two set input set output seta function something take value input set map value output set often hear input output set refer red special math input set usually cal led domain output set usually cal led range really common see function input output listed call function table function table normally two left input value sand one right corresponding output function often written function table form sort mathematical rule procedure example let say input set function list common polygon like triangle square pentagon hexagon octagon function could simple rule say output number sides mean input triangle function output input square output input pentagon output function simply name polygon number sides function encounter algebra little abstract usually relate one variable another variable form equation one equation treat x set input domain set get output range simple algebraic function like polygon example make function table show possible input output function could choose number value x keep thing simple let try input ting value x see output get table input value word substitute value x equation get since output variable put output column next input value function get mean output value last input value function get mean output value pattern input value output value twice big would expect original equation say output equal times x seen example function relate input important limitation function need know understand limitation let try make function table equation squared equal x x variable equation set input variable set output variable help first solve equation taking square root sides negative need take positive negative root x since two possible solution equation mess function table input x value positive principal root would also negative root solution x possible solution equation squared equal x case value x input equation get two value output scan function whistle blowing upon review equation gave two output single input therefore rule function see function call one particular input value could result many different output value relation certainly exist see example call something cal led function produce one output value input value function set input set output sa function member input set exactly one member output equation function matter number put always get one number output equation squared equal x qualify function single input produce one output let look another simple algebraic equation see function x x value input domain value output quickly generate function table possible input value like integer watched last video graph ing plane may notice row function table basically ordered pair x value value could even rewrite input output ordered pair form wan ted mean also graph pair input output plane graph function point function table plotted plane resulting graph get connect point sit form straight line example cal led linear function algebra lots different kind function interesting function strig function sand many graph may look like bunch squiggly function sand tell function looking graph pass vertical line test remember function one output value particular input value well vertical line test help us see graph relation would disqualify function vertical line drawn plane graph want test imagine moving vertical line left right across domain paying close attention point vertical line intersect graph vertical line intersect graph exactly one point every possible value x domain mean one output value input value one value x value graph graph pass vertical line test example graph pass vertical line test well one graph equation squared equal x domain equation include negative input place vertical line interest graph one place vertical line would intersect graph one point also move right x axis see vertical line intersect ing curve two mean equation giving us two possible output mean considered wrap need talk briefly common function notation pretty first time see math far writing function like x often see exact function written like instead variable get f parentheses x thingy even mean well turns really common way represent function notation simply mean function name f take input value name x give output value name say like function x equal f x equal short problem notation could easily misinterpret variable f implicitly variable x give answer mean sin case f name variable f name function would lot clear mathematician used entire word function name used input output instead x two notation mean exactly thing first one abbreviation function name standard variable input output common could use wan ted basic notation equation get change f x instead well comes idea two thing equal math substitute one thing since agreed general notation function f x mean use f x interchangeable either one represent output set function interchangeable would use complicated f x could use instead well f x highlight fact dealing function specific input variable give us handy notation function specific example could start saying let function f x could ask someone evaluate function input value saying mean substitute place x function function would mean could value easy huh alright function math thing relate input value exactly one output value set input value cal led domain set output value usually cal led algebra function typically come form equation plane treating input output value ordered course lot learn basic introduction help get star ted working algebra forget practice learned video always thanks watching math antic see ya next time learn
