jam es grime recently big math news didnt new prime number biggest prime number ever big quite excited lots fun got thinking one classic proof mathematics proof infinitely many even though found huge prime number still biggest prime number theres infinitely many shall classic proof ill say start many may seen proof goes way back havent seen consider elegant beautiful proof going prove infinitely many first going assume opposite going say finitely many theres finitely many write let going call prime know particularly let prime prime ill go get last one ill call prime point want make though complete list thats next thing going going make new number whole going call q let call q make number going multiply together prime times prime times prime way last one prime n one way write q product unique expression theres one way write q going add either prime thats option q prime new prime thats list thats bad hopefully prime prime made multiplying together prime factor q divide q exactly problem none list divide q exactly theyll divide number perfectly plus always left prime factor list list complete said theres finitely many complete list cannot thats proof infinitely many definition prime whole made multiplying together q whole number made multiplying together case problem none list trick dont divide number exactly theres missing got copy book cal led textbook written cal led lived textbook year old never print second respect one important book mathematics one important book human history proof infinitely checked page book nine proposition right proof infinitely many couple difference proof difference proof something cal led proof contradiction something mathematician lot really useful slightly different assumed list prime sand said keep never complete list sort idea difference book written days algebra didnt algebra use like proof straight look quite different actually quite easy translate modern see mathematics search truth book true today year ago know prime number divided factor define actually quite excited found let beginning book seven define prime number measured unit alone fit prime number measured line length prime fit cant fit length something prime make fit wouldnt able fit would fit length tried wouldnt fit length prime length would fit thats definition ha ran mean new prime number found grime tiny new prime number million whole infinity prime small ha ran understanding prime become less frequent higher density becomes lower mean next prime number likely longway away million grime become spaced right theres getting thing fantastic theorem prime spaced density prime slipping ha ran like another grime sound like another good one well
