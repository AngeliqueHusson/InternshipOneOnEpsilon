jam es grime recently big math news n new prime number biggest prime number ever big quite excited lots fun got thinking one classic proof mathematics proof infinitely many even though found huge prime number still biggest prime number infinitely many shall classic proof say start many may seen proof goes way back n seen consider elegant beautiful proof going prove infinitely many first going assume opposite going say finitely many finitely many write let going call prime n know particularly let prime prime go get last one ill call prime point want make though complete list next thing going going make new number whole number going call q let call q make number going multiply together prime times prime times prime way last one prime n one way write q product unique expression one way write q going add either prime option q prime new prime list bad hopefully prime prime made multiplying together prime factor q divide q exactly problem none list divide q exactly divide number perfectly plus number always left prime factor list list complete said finitely many complete list proof infinitely many definition prime whole made multiplying together q whole number made multiplying together case problem none list trick n divide number exactly missing got copy book cal led textbook written cal led lived textbook year old never print second respect one important book one important book human history proof infinitely checked page book nine proposition right proof infinitely many couple difference proof difference proof something cal led proof contradiction something mathematician really useful slightly different assumed list prime sand said keep never complete list sort idea difference book written days algebra n algebra use like proof straight look quite different actually quite easy translate modern see mathematics search truth book true today year ago know prime number divided factor define actually quite excited found let definition look beginning book seven define prime number measured unit alone fit prime number measured line length prime fit ca n fit length something prime length let make go fit would n able fit would fit length tried would n fit length prime length would fit definition ha ran mean new prime number found jam es grime tiny new prime number million long whole infinity prime small ha ran understanding prime become less frequent higher density becomes lower mean next prime number likely longway away million jam es grime become spaced right getting thing fantastic theorem prime spaced density prime slipping ha ran like another grime sound like another video good one well infinite infinite infinite
