holly want talk maybe least efficient way possible approximate number ha ran well thats good sell holly good sell really interesting wan na talk pi set maybe best bit reminder set remember object complex plane real number sand imaginary number sand set collection complex ill try sort draw nice version complicated right collection complex property look function z squared plus c apply zero zero plugged function c output c plugged function c squared plus c ona number c set exactly process repeat repeat repeat number stays smaller equal two today worried complex number si want talk real ha ran mean talking thing along line holly exactly exactly fact gon na interested happen son portion real line one thing say first point point cal led cusp set point exactly value c one ha ran thats last point real line direction thats set pi somewhere presumably pi set holly pi set thats absolutely right say going approximate pi dont mean gon na approximate pi picture mean gon na cook bunch approximate ha ran going use set tool holly tool approximate pi exactly course know looking say well theres circle indeed circle inside set gon na use one thats little straightforward way get piso idea happen take real number thats one fourth said mean let call number say already used c let call c anyways whatever number c start process number c look function z squared plus cand plug zero output c plug output get c squared plus c plug output point gon na two right restriction set number sare eventually gon na number c gon na associate number say n cand equal number step zero z squared plus c exactly process de scribing get something ha ran number cusp holly ha ran killer gon na kill set holly thats right eventually get ha ran thing interested quickly number kill us holly exactly something thats totally natural interested people draw picture set example exactly counting kind start real number c thats two first step iteration get c two know one parameter possibly set case n c equal one small value ha ran two holly thats right might imagine closer get cusp take get two right starting smaller number take smore step get right let make little bit start number really close one fourth say say c equal one fourth plus epsilon small positive real ha ran cusp holly thats right right cusp real axis count number step take us escape something say know wolfram alpha sage whatever program wan na use draw table number n c depend epsilon coming getting smaller smaller coming towards cusp c actually count long take number thats two example epsilon one c one plus one fourth one point two five n c two take two step get ha ran well u h quickly holly thats right hand much reasonable value epsilon say like one one hundredth c point two six say number step take escape turns thirty actually take epsilon smaller c even closer one quarter value get case three ha ran oh wow thats lot lot step right really close cusp take lot step escape take epsilon even smaller c even closer cusp get something even better even value n ha ran see something suspicious happening ha ran see see holly everyone see whats happening long put decimal point right place see change epsilon sort regularly decimal point kind move regularly long put decimal point right place value n care actually converging ha ran thats cool holly yeah yeah get approximation pi right three point one five good approximation three point one four little better turns next one something like three one four one four even better tremendously inefficient method taking value c thats really close cusp set many thousand times get number thats two give approximate pi
