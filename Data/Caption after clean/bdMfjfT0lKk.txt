welcome back last part sho wed way solve counting binary solution learned computer scientist schwarz somehow landed without watching probably want go check video want describe constrained variant puzzle finding curve fill triangle problem variant think disc line move disk one spindle adjacent one question solve example previous one start moving disc b next move move disc c cant get straight c exactly complicated idea version still similar want move disc let say trying get c cant move disc unless tower way ultimately id like get tower blocking theres two ways block previously top top cant adjacent either really want take tower somehow dont know get thing c move disc b get c back move disc spindle b spindle c move tower way back smaller case break essentially way solve two disc move disc number solve move disc number solve two disc yet keep subdividing self similar pattern expanding subproblem set subproblem eventually get subproblem moving tower size involve moving disc number twice unconstrained case going give efficient solution since every scale move subtower peg c plan moving disc number move back order move disc move way back c third time theres never room inefficiency break term subproblem like unconstrained puzzle mirrored pattern counting binary breakdown constrained problem mirrored counting base also known ternary let take moment talk base like rhythm counting know usual counting system base ten separate binary base two separate ternary system represent ing three distinct symbol available dont even know call bit digit think talking ear lier doesnt sound right indeed cal led hey little bit ask speaker feel convention calling binary anyway back let think rhythm counting ternary start counting roll second three place count roll represent ing six point roll twice nine place writing number nine like base base theres certain self similarity pattern scales look like counting amount rolling counting amount rolling counting amount third time pattern saw constrained sub task make kind movement sub task make movement sub task third time like binary counting mirror solution unconstrained counting ternary going mirror recursive pattern constrained give really nice methodical way solve constrained problem counting every time last trip move disc number first two move counting moving disc whenever roll three place count two three move disc number like youd flip last move flip last move roll writing move disc twice flip last move disc whenever roll twice nine place move disk number pretty fun sit back watch play take though four disc going count way ternary mean involve step nevertheless like said efficient solution also give something cool ask many different configuration actually let take moment think many total configuration disc peg possible disk given peg descending order size answer possible puzzle see notice three choice put biggest disc three choice put next biggest disc successive disc three choice place remember process counting ternary involve taking step mean start end going hit different configuration think cant hit given configuration twice would efficient solution working first time hit configuration skipping everything second time hit configuration sense sort grand tour solve go every single possible configuration disk pretty cool right well thing get awesome familiar graph beautiful structure configuration going represent one configuration dot node graph say two different configuration connected could move one legal move time mean unconstrained move configuration still considered connected even require move peg peg c go connect configuration like finding edge represent kind move graph structure suspiciously familiar shape let zoom think pattern coming example node represent ing start state disc peg going connected one result moving disc peg b connected one result moving disc peg c three configuration make little triangle graph three configuration mutually connected fact configuration going part one triangle somewhere graph consider happen freely move around disc number among three peg understand little triangular island inter connected take look two differ movement disc number peg peg c theyre going connected edge edge kind bridge two different triangle island fact two triangle along one form kind meta triangle consider movement disc little clump three represent different position disc number tri force pattern whole represent configuration get moving around disc number self similarly movement disc number give bridge one tri force pattern new one three possible place disc live give us three separate tri force pattern connected little bridge fact two one tri force pattern edge going pattern reflection fact hard move disc number happen special configuration disc disc way consider disc pattern continue graph structure configuration one big triangle crazy let think mean method constrained problem counting ternary walk possible configuration going give us way wander graph hit node crazy look graph structure clear first path even possible yet found one counting thats beautiful dont know final animation want show guy path look like graph higher higher order first thanks order fine video always gratitude like last video star ted working essence calculus series far really feedback patron giving pair video also sup ported like said end part really meaningful interactive math classroom pretty great tool importantly theyre hi ring anyone interested definitely check page linked description mean reach interested lot make flashy tool hope modern technology math curricula often theres actual pedagogical substance underlying tech really think though going thing right way surprise amount collective teaching experience among team even nonteacher met really thoughtful really well versed comes educational research result actually address whats student education interested space interested going place know actually matter highly encourage take look right last animation going show path walk graph according way ternary counting solve constrained puzzle fade graph emphasize path look like higher higher order corresponding disc seeing similar idea space filling curve tal ked curve video limit fill instead square crazy curve fill triangle totally dont think curve type thing
