want video fairly straightforward primer perimeter area perimeter left area right probably pretty familiar concept revisit case perimeter essentially distance go around something put fence around something measure put tape around figure long tape would example let say rectangle rectangle figure sides right rectangle right right angle sand sides opposite equal length side going equal length side side equal length side maybe label point b c dand let say know following know b equal know b c equal want know perimeter let write perimeter rectangle going equal sum length sides build fence like plot land would measure long side right well already know side right length plus length going tell us c going length b going plus finally da ad however want call going length b c plus plus plus plus going perimeter could go way say square special case rectangle square sides right angle equal let draw square best attempt b c going tell right square let say square perimeter square perimeter given length sides well sides going length let call b x b c x c x ad x sides congruent segment congruent measure call x want figure perimeter x plus x plus x plus x write x plus x plus x plus x equal going equal gave us problem solve times something could solve probably head could divide sides get x equal square width height right also perimeter area kind measure much thing take two dimension one way think area square square say mean specify two square rectangle two going example could call rectangle immediately tell k side side side side square could say square sides could really say square square one side really going square view area figure many square fit figure example going back rectangle right wan ted find area rectangle notation use area put something area rectangle equal number square fit rectangle let try manually think already might get sense little bit let put bunch let square way going try best draw neatly going along one sides go along one sides like could put along one side like many see see row row make sense add add could actually count kind straight forward multiplication want know total number could count say well got column si going say cube square si square direction direction going total area figure right general method could say well going take one dimension sand multiply dimension rectangle let say rectangle dimension swell could multiply say times area going might say well mean well mean dimension could fit square wan ted whole square distorted would look like half another half one like add guy guy together going get whole area square well square special case length width square let draw square let call n know let make sand let say wan ted find area let say know one side x equal want find area use specify area figure polygon right square know square know sides equal well special case rectangle would multiply length times width know theyre going multiply times want think square word comes squaring something multiply times equal squared word comes finding area square equal could see could easily fit square square perimeter area basic perimeter area volume geometry khan academy perimeter area basic perimeter area volume geometry khan academy perimeter area basic perimeter area volume geometry khan academy
