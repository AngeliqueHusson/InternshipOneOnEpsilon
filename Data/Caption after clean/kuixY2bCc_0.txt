welcome video matrix multiplication get example want talk sizes matrix matrix another matrix let take look size first matrix first matrix one two row one two three column first matrix two three matrix two three column take second matrix multiplying one two three row one two three column second matrix three three matrix order multiply two matrices together first matrix must equal row second matrix word two inside really important check multiply matrices two cannot multiply two matrices make sure inside take look outside ill draw point outside number sand outside always give size new matrix done multiplying since outside know size new matrix done multiplying going let get star ted right away example basically multiply two matrices multiplying first matrix column second matrix going put abox around first row first matrix going put another box around first column make thing little easier see multiply going circle first number row going circle first number column green circle second number row black going circle number column black dim going circle third number row red going circle also third number column red multiply first column multiply green together times multiply black together positive multiply red together positive first row first column want exact thing first row second column first row still ear lier ill put another box around second column going circle first number green second number black third number red multiply green together get times multiply black together get times positive multiply red together get times second column thing going first row third column first row ill put box around column circle first second black third red multiply green get multiply black get times positive multiply red get times positive one first matrix every single column second matrix need exact thing second row first matrix ill put box around second row need multiply second row every column second matrix first column ill box around going circle first green black red multiply green together times give us positive multiply black together negative times negative multiply together times positive multiply row first column need exact thing second column going put abox around second column circle first number green number black third number red multiply together times positive multiply together times negative multiply red together times second row second column one last time need multiply second row third column ill put box around first number green number black third number red multiply together times positive multiply together negative positive negative multiply red times positive see get pretty long tedious every row first matrix every column second matrix thing left simplify matrix add together top left corner plus plus bottom left corner minus negative negative plus positive second column plus plus also minus positive plus equal top right plus plus equal bottom right minus negative negative plus equal negative final answer two matrices together
