know feeling get seem completely unrelated turn key connection math especially theres certain tingly sensation get whenever one connection start fall place store today take little time set introduce fair division puzzle indiscrete math cal led stolen necklace problem also setup certain topological fact well use solve theorem trust seeing two seemingly disconnected piece math come together well worth setup fun video put similar fair division problem completely video eager head channel somehow dont already know stuff best math tube definitely poke around rest channel subscribe like stuff much puzzle going solve stolen necklace problem friend steal necklace full whole bunch valuable got sapphire let say theyre necklace totally random order moreover let say even number type jewel right sapphire diamond friend want split booty evenly getting half jewel type sapphire diamond course could cut jewel necklace divvy evenly thats boring theres really puzzle challenge make necklace possible divvy resulting coconspirator still end half jewel type example give top three strand bottom two strand coconspirator notice sapphire emerald diamond claim thing want prove video n different type always possible find fair division n cut jewel type like example always able find way make cut divvy piece thief number jewel type jewel type able five cut matter arrangement kind hard think right mean need keep track jewel theyre divided fairly time try minimize many making depending disposition puzzle math maybe little contrive core characteristic make problem hard like trying trying allocate collection thing balanced way kind actually come fair amount practical application computer system folk sure imagine could relate kind efficient memory allocation problem also curious actually see action left video description certain electrical engineering paper problem independent usefulness though good puzzle always find fair many cut thats puzzle remember going take seemingly unrelated side step total opposite side mathematical universe topology imagine taking sphere space squish ing somehow onto plane however want constraint continuously think meaning never cut sphere way map ping continuously sphere onto plane many different pair point sphere going land top hit plane thats really big special fact going use known theorem always able pair point star ted exact opposite sides sphere land exact opposite side sphere cal led antipodes example let say sphere earth choose project every point directly onto plane equator well case north south antipodal land point example thats antipodal pair land point antipodal pair end somehow offset let tweak function bit maybe shearing projection case north south pole probably dont land topology door open window matter must antipodal pair land top classic example illustrate idea math educator theorem require law present must exist pair point opposite side earth temperature barometric pressure precisely think point earth pair temperature pressure map ping surface earth plane represent temperature second one represent pressure also value vari es continuously wander around earth association continuous map ping surface sphere onto plane non tearing way squash surface two dimension theorem guarantee matter weather pattern earth planet matter pair antipodal must land top mean map ped temperature pressure imagine watching probably mathematician heart want see true actually taled great video recently fixed point gave really beautiful line reasoning explain intuitively gon na shamelessly use given function sphere onto plane imagine walking around equator corresponding output plane going form kind closed let say sister exact opposite side globe walk around continue keeping perfectly antipodal ly opposite since two eventually swap place point along way line first time happen want mark sphere well antipodal sister tilt equator slightly walk slightly different great circle corresponding loop output space going alter bit reasoning point walk antipodal sister land output lining vertically mark two point sphere well repeat continuously turning equator around full circle marked point going make new closed loop around sphere might look like output space keeping track antipodal sister first line vertically every point new loop one word antipodal sister definition end x two walking around new loop always line vertically since two eventually going swap place must point along way also give point antipodal sister must land output pretty cool right help set stage heck necklace problem want write mean little symbolically point space three right mean sense thats mathematician least possible triplet number snow sphere describe standard unit sphere centered origin set distance one origin meaning triplet property sum equal geometric idea sphere related algebraic idea set positive add one remember one triplet point opposite side sphere corresponding antipodal point whatever get sign right let write saying symbolically going help going function take point sphere triplet spit point pair like temperature pressure long function continuous input doesnt change output turn back stolen necklace problem part reason two thing feel unrelated necklace problem discrete theorem continuous situation first step translate stolen necklace problem continuous version right let limit jewel emerald make fair division necklace two cut example say eight sapphire sand emerald necklace reminder mean goal cut necklace two divvy three thief half half top bottom four sapphire necklace line length one jewel sitting evenly spaced divided line evenly sized segment one jewel rather thinking tool discrete indivisible entity segment remove jewel instead paint segment color jewel case painting whole necklace appropriately line going painted sapphire line going painted emerald continuous version puzzle ask whether find two cut anywhere line necessarily interval let us divide piece thief equal length color case mean thief end total length sapphire colored segment emerald colored segment important somewhat subtle point solve continuous variant puzzle also solve original discrete version see say find fair division whose cut dont necessarily fall cleanly cut part way emerald segment well fair division length emerald top bottom group exactly five emerald segment sa whole number multiple segment length even division cut partially emerald segment left would also cut partially emerald segment right total length add number multiple segment length mean adjust cut without affecting division ultimately line mark continuous case cut line wherever heck want think choice go cutting necklace first choose two cut interval another way think choose three positive add one example maybe choose would correspond two cut find three add one give away cut necklace vice cut make binary choice one three piece whether goes thief goes thief compare ked choose arbitrary point sphere point x z x squared plus squared plus z might start choosing three positive add maybe want x squared squared z squared make binary choice one choosing whether take positive square root negative square root way thats completely parallel choosing necklace division choosing point sphere involve first finding three positive one making binary choice one right key observation whole video correspondence point sphere necklace division point x z sphere x squared plus squared plus z squared equal one cut necklace first piece length x squared second length squared third length z squared choose allocate piece x positive give thief otherwise give thief positive give second piece thief otherwise give thief similarly allocate third piece z positive give otherwise give thief go way around correspondence way divide necklace divvy would give unique point sphere sphere perfect way encapsulate idea possible necklace division association tantalizingly close take moment think meaning association point x z sphere correspond necklace allocation point x z correspond square would correspond making cut necklace difference thief antipodal point opposite side sphere piece two thieve snow remember actually looking want total length jewel type belonging thief equal thief word fair antipodal swap doesnt change amount jewel belonging thief brain burning thought point specifically way might move forward construct certain function function take given necklace allocation spit two total length sapphire belonging thief total length emerald belonging thief want must exist way divide necklace two cut sand divvy piece two would thief set little differently swapping piece wont change two thief back forth necklace allocation point sphere pair point x effect map ping sphere onto plane guarantee antipodal pair point sphere land plane mean necklace division allocation swapping piece two thieve wont change amount jewel one thats fair division friend beautiful like anything like glow clever proof might easy forget actually want solve general stolen necklace problem one jewel type general version one sphere example one dimension also map ping hypersphere space space mean hypersphere way think possible list four sum square equal point space distance origin theorem say map set three dimensional space continuously one triplet must antipodal collision input change output going pause ponder think would apply three jewel case general statement might apply general necklace problem needless say actually trying visualize sphere map ping rather difficult nevertheless final animation try show might look like actually multiple announcement guess first one really announcement want say thank people making always store go check get pause ponder shirt well three different curve go well maybe going add shirt potentially little pleasure number dont forget put video different approach similar fair division problem sphere thing definitely go give look dont already know channel check rest finally particular video great course plus imagine many watching channel especially found linear algebra series binge learning great course plus lecture series one actually think would like lot inexplicable universe unsolved nei l deg rasse dont think need tell great deg rasse series disappoint going ur l screen easily following link description get one month see talking alright final animation little analogy upper left rotating sphere three dimension projecting showing latitude sphere shading similarly center four dimensional hypersphere space projecting showing latitude speak keep mind dont actually need tobe able visualize three dimension able understand much less stolen necklace problem fun pretty try dont
