hi five term sequence wonder could tell next term going going next term going well seen multiplying term constant value example multiplying term two way along another example example multiplying term multiplying term minus times minus going give meat minus multiply minus minus get next term sequence one would minus soon get sequence like multiply term constant value theyre cal led geometric progression geometric sequence well quite often going find going pattern like example going need know particular term well seeing third term sequence fifth term suppose term dont want also going want know sum term going sum first three term clearly plus plus suppose wan ted sum first hundred going want type calculator add far long tutorial want show get general formula nth term sum first n term geometric progression general weve got weve got geometric sequence first term multiply first term particular number constant value well call next term second term would ar multiply term constant value r third term becomes r squared fourth term r cube fifth term r power go like geometric sequence put word sequence moment clearly able see nth term given times r power n minus wan ted third term would set would r minus r squared see third termin r squared came toad ding term would cal led geometric series add let say plus ar plus ar squared going use standard letter summation first n term letter often written subscript n sum first n term going way r power n minus nth term r n minus shown sum first n term geometric progression given formula bracket r power n minus divided r minus mind people prefer use another formula rather one multiply bottom minus end times switch term top bracket around get minus r power n switch bottom multiply minus get minus r plus prefer write minus r theyll give exactly answer doesnt matter formula use tend use one common ratio multiplying number tend good idea use one r less say doesnt matter one use generally id like quick example weve got sequence four twelve thirty six hundred eight weve got find sixth term sum first clearly geometric progression see multiplying term three comes working sixth term according formula nth term going r n minus first term example four times ratio three multiplying three power n minus one looking sixth term six six take away one five work calculator find get sixth term sequence weve got first four would admittedly could used calculator got sixth term quickly times three times three would given quick example show get particular term sequence comes finding sum first term looking given one formula going take one common ratio three one could try formula still work four times common ratio three power n three power case take one divided minus one three take away one work calculator find get comes thousand well thats brief introduction geometric progression geometric sequence would certainly encourage look example follow take bit still formula k well end
