let start segment point point b right let set perpendicular bisector segment perpendicular split segment two thus could call line l going perpendicular bisector going intersect angle bisect length length equal let call point right herem maybe want prove first video pick arbitrary point line perpendicular bisector b arbitrary point equal distant distance point distance point b let pick arbitrary point let call arbitrary point cand imagine like draw triangle let draw triangle draw line c another one c band essentially prove ca equal c b proven want prove c equal distance b well couple interesting thing see know equal b also know c equal obviously segment going equal know right angle also right angle line perpendicular bisector band two right triangle sand actually dont even worry right look triangle c side congruent corresponding side angle angle angle c correspond angle degree congruent side c triangle congruent use congruency write triangle congruent triangle congruency congruent corresponding sides congruent c correspond two thing must congruent length must length right proven want prove arbitrary point c perpendicular bisector b equidistant band could known drew c would made exact argument c thats line fair enough let write mean c equal let go way say find point equidistant b sit perpendicular bisector let draw like b let throw point call c let say c right maybe draw c right c going start assumption c equidistant b ca going equal going start going assumption want prove perpendicular bisector drawn triangle done always drop altitude side triangle right set line right draw like let drop altitude right although really dropping kind lifting altitude case rotated around triangle loo ked like b c would really dropping altitude construct line right angle b let call point intersect prove c perpendicular bisector really show c segment perpendicular bisector way weve already perpendicular really show bisect right two right right angle one way right angle know c going equal right angle leg hypotenuse know r sh postulate right angle one corresponding leg thats congruent corresponding leg triangle hypotenuse congruent hypotenuse two triangle congruent triangle congruent triangle congruent corresponding going congruent tell us must equal b theyre corresponding sides side right going congruent really bisect ing line c really perpendicular bisector whole reason interesting thing perpendicular bisector sand point equidistant point sand review found hey perpendicular bisector segment equidistant segment went way point equidistant segment perpendicular bisector segment let apply triangle let draw arbitrary triangle try draw fairly large let say triangle give triangle point point b point c could call triangle let construct perpendicular bisector segment going bisect distance going equal distance going perpendicular look something like perpendicular actually let draw little different way drawn triangle making us get close special case actually talk next video let draw triangle little bit one might little bit better see special case going going b going c let take point right mid point band draw perpendicular bisector perpendicular bisector might look something like n want make necessarily intersect c necessarily going case going angle length equal length let thing segment c right take mid point roughly draw look like right let draw perpendicular bisector would look something like length right equal length see intersect point fun let call point interesting point owe know since b perpendicular bisector know distance bis going distance proved first little proof know going equal kind neat also know intersection green perpendicular bisector yellow perpendicular bisector also know perpendicular bisector c equidistant c know equal equal boa also equal c c thing well also know c must equal must equal point equidistant two point either end segment point must sit perpendicular bisector segment second proof right must sit perpendicular bisector draw perpendicular bisector right definitely b c perpendicular bisector neat simple little proof set video shown unique point triangle equidistant vertices triangle perpendicular bisector three sides another way think weve shown perpendicular bisector three sides intersect unique point equidistant vertices unique point triangle special call circumcenter equidistant vertices distance let color n used distance right equal distance right equal distance construct circle center whose radius orange distance whose radius distance circle goes vertices triangle centered circle would look best attempt draw right one shown construct something like call thing circumcircle distance right call circumradius know construct point centered circle goes vertices triangle say circumscribed triangle say right circumcircle circle right circumscribed triangle mean three vertices lie circle every point circumradius away circumcenter circumcenter triangle
