welcome let us explore question zero raised zero th power weve seen previous lesson two zero th power one lesson theres nothing special number two could worked number three see three zero th zero th power zero th power given work lesson seem appropriate say zero th power going little strange right going argue zero th power actually goes could well ill use algebra convince us fundamental law exponent previous episode said times b multiply actual superscript plus b well let apply particular choice law times squared plus right half right seven half times something equal something actually know zero squared zero zero times without doubt know thats zero really saying times zero fact zero actually true anything times zero zero therefore indeed course thats bit ache aper argument could put number fact would fine since three quarters also afraid actually algebraic statement number could go zero zero contradict algebraic statement actually help oh need examine right come come away ne algebraically c know define answer maybe analytically theres another approach see number least positive number zero th power example point point zero one one hundredth power would see heading left side want become zero th power whereas right hand side constantly stay ing seem argument let another way power point tenth root correct times times indeed root fact point hundredth root thats still well follow wrote want become right hand sides right hand side time number say want contradiction algebraically clear answer analytically seem clear art well let take another perch dont graph ing look graph equal x x power thats certainly fine graph put get power answer put equal ill get tooth power get power certainly fine graph x equal ill give power square root actually graph beast let draw right either hand graph ing calculator find graph blow tremendously fast ah scuse ah blow tremendously fast positive whole forgetting close zero want look like number one turns tobe look like zero want one actually try type formula calculator see graph look like look closely graph suggesting x equal zero want one well fine dandy however graph sketch es example sketch graph equal zero x sketch graph equal x zero two want x afraid leave two different picture true answer simply undefined theres answer algebraically saw law sewer times e b equal e plus b theres answer analytically one actually obtain answer one desire nice little catalyst question way look graph equal x x look closely dip wondering dip lo west value graph know calculus extra challenge moment prove lo west point occur x equal e even though dont know define graph theres something cruel calculus student nonetheless thanks
