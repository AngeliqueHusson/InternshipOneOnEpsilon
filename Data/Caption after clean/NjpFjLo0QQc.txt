g day welcome tech math channel going look video way working least common multiple first least common multiple well want work least common multiple least common multiple number go going look made another video look different method good method working least common multiple big fairly reliable fact hundred percent reliable one work first thing going going find common factor part doesnt take long factor biggest number goes say divide smaller two bigger one divided first step one remainder look remainder going carry next stage going carried next stage smaller two also going carried next stage going look many times going bit repeat divide smaller large one divided answer mean mean give circle common factor biggest number goes loo ked different video used work though least common multiple follow really really simple divide one number sis common factor one either k ill divide goes six times times multiply one six times lace least common multiple would n matte red could gone divided five times would got answer bad little method actually accurate method look couple example n panic straight away didnt get straight away n worry give example right ill give nice easy example go look right say wan ted work nice easy put everything order biggest number number n order rearrange first divide number well goes times divided remainder move remainder across smaller move next stage goes four times remainder remainder common factor right divide common factor two original work least common multiple min goes k times times pretty cool right right going like k necessarily always faster method loo ked video correct really method especially starting something little bit say lo west least common multiple nasty bit crazy tell chuck even example divide divided divided going get aa remainder array move remainder next stage going move smaller one divided many times ah goes three times remainder still remain common factor yet go one step go another step going move next stage going move next stage smaller divided two times remainder n mean found common factor goes seven times divided seven times going seven thousand two hundred eighty see method working ridiculous going give example nasty example yeah might actually ever get five thousand two hundred two two four three one know divide one going find common factor first one goes one goes goes twice remainder pause give us go see already star ted bit pause go right going take one two four three one going divide many times occur trying find different color actually goes seven times remainder going happen going move going next stage divided get six times six times going c going remainder getting move going see rapidly getting stage getting somewhere though going go one time fright ing wrong pin one time remainder going next stage divided remainder hey two times two times remainder got going see many times goes one divided going get answer one divided one herein answer times get least multiple seven hundred forty three thousand eight yes prepare one ear lier thought id show method think method tell one hundred percent accurate beauty miss something method actually n get dent common factor end trouble one works time anyway told think great method know see next time bye least common multiple trick least common multiple trick least common multiple trick
