right let go make complicated right vertex angle going end point kind two ray going come together form let look angle kind one standard form look like one like right little bit dark er remember angle angle two ray right array member excuse end point going go infinity infinity point remember talking angle measurement two ray two sides lot times call initial terminal side rotating point rotate call vertex vertex angle two ray go quick little description vertex angle thanks vertex angle vertex angle vertex angle
