first thing want know surface area entire sphere remember talking surface area talking outer surface know area cover little square know patch es right many would cover outer surface formula times pi times radius squared hemisphere go ahead cut half right happen go cut half surface right going pi r squared half pi r squared process cutting half expose bottom circle cutting like half like pick look part right see going circle thats also becoming outer surface know area circle pi r squared think pi r squared add together hemisphere surface area actually pi r squared sometimes student mistakenly say pi r squared want pi r squared quick example give radius real simple radius going times pi times squared thats pi squared whatever square hope understand work hemisphere little bit better interested feel free contact otherwise subscribe channel check math tube channel tutor ing look forward seeing future video ill talk soon
