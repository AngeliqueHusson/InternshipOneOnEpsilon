guy somewhat mathematical idol love quote often math dive showing certain fact true long series formula stepping back making sure reasonable preferably obvious least intuitive level video want talk integral thing want become inverse derivative focus one example kind dual example moving car tal ked chapter series derivative next video see idea generalize context imagine sitting car see window see speedometer point car start moving speed slows back stop second question nice way figure far traveled time based view speedometer better yet find distance function st tell far traveled given amount time second say take note velocity second make plot time like maybe find nice function model velocity time per second v might remember chapter series looking opposite situation know distance function st want figure velocity function sho wed derivative distance v time function give velocity v time function current situation know velocity function make sense finding distance v time function st comes function derivative often describe finding anti derivative function indeed end could even pause try right first want spend bulk video showing question related finding area bounded velocity graph help build intuition whole class cal led math science question would much simpler car moving constant velocity right case could multiply velocity per second amount time passe second give number traveled notice visualize distance area distance area seem weird right plot horizontal direction second vertical direction area naturally correspond make situation hard velocity constant incessantly every instant would even lot easier ever change handful point maybe stay ing static first second suddenly discontinuously jump ing constant per second next second discontinuous jump portion constant velocity might make uncomfortable driver fact physically impossible would make calculation lot straightforward could compute distance traveled interval multiplying constant velocity interval change time add approximate velocity function constant bunch different interval common calculus see refining approximation lead us something precise make concrete chop time axis many small interval little width like second consider one interval like one reality car speed time find plugging equation velocity want approximate motion velocity constant interval reason really know handle anything constant velocity situation could choose constant anything really matter matter sequence approximation whatever get better better get smaller smaller treating journey bunch discontinuous jump speed small portion constant velocity becomes less wrong reflection reality decrease time jump convenience approximate speed interval whatever true velocity start interval height graph left side case example interval according approximation car move nicely visualize area thin rectangle little real distance traveled much goes every interval approximate distance plug different value one giving different height rectangle going write expression sum rectangle kind funny way take symbol look like sum put bottom top indicate ranging time step second said amount time step two thing implicit notation first value play two role factor quantity also spacing time step make smaller even though decrease area rectangle increase total number rectangle whose second reason use usual sigma notation indicate sum expression technically particular sum particular choice whatever sum approach es approach es see approach es area bounded curve horizontal axis remember smaller choice indicate closer approximation original question far car go right limiting value sum area curve give precise answer question full unapproximate precision tell surprising pretty complicated idea approximation involve huge number tiny thing yet value approximate approach describe simply area curve expression cal led v since bring value together integrate could say help one hard question finding far car traveled another equally hard problem finding area graph horizontal right velocity distance duo video area curve nonsense would waste time could skip straight ahead anti derivative finding area graph horizontal axis somewhat common language many disparate problem broken approximate sum large number small thing see next video say abstract understanding interpret compute area graph general tool fact first video series already covered basic works background derivative actually take idea completion velocity example think right end point variable capital thinking integral velocity function area curve two input function upper bound variable area represent distance car traveled second right really distance v time function st ask derivative function one hand tiny change distance tiny change time velocity velocity mean another way see purely term graph area generalize better integral problem slight nudge input cause area increase little area sliver height sliver height graph point v width small enough basically consider sliver rectangle area sliver approximately equal approximation get better better smaller derivative area function point equal v value velocity function whatever time star ted super general derivative function giving area graph like equal function graph velocity function function derivative actually roll sleeve math easier see expand take part one time function derivative well know derivative scale see derivative second part kind function might derivative power rule know derivative cubic term give squared term scale third derivative exactly making negative see derivative therefore anti derivative slight issue could add constant function derivative would still derivative constant always graph st think sense moving graph distance function nothing affect slope input actually infinitely many different possible anti derivative function look like c constant c one piece information used yet us zero anti derivative use lower bound integral integral must zero drag right end point way left end point right distance traveled car second second zero found area function capital anti derivative stuff inside choose constant add subtract value anti derivative function lower bound think moment integral lower bound indeed happen evaluate function get zero specific case actually need subtract anything example total distance traveled second expression evaluate minus typical example would something like integral area pictured represent distance traveled second second evaluate anti derivative found top bound subtract value bottom bound notice matter anti derivative choose reason constant added like constant would cancel generally time want integrate function remember think value input certain range sum approach es x approach es first step find anti derivative function whose derivative thing inside integral integral equal anti derivative evaluate top bound minus value bottom bound fact cal led theorem crazy fact integral limiting value sum thin rectangle take account every single input continuum lower bound upper bound use word bring together yet actually compute anti derivative look two input top bottom almost like cheating finding anti derivative implicitly account information add value lower bound upper bound kind lot pac ked whole concept recap everything shall wan ted figure far car goes looking speedometer make hard velocity always approximate constant multiple different interval figure far car goes interval multiplication add product visualize sum many thin rectangle like better better approximation original problem correspond collection rectangle whose aggregate area closer closer area curve start time end time area curve precise distance traveled true nowhere constant velocity function think area function variable right end point deduce derivative area function must equal height graph point key find function giving area ask function v derivative actually infinitely many given function since always add constant without affecting derivative account subtract ing value whatever anti derivative function choose bottom bound way one important thing bring leaving idea negative area velocity function negative point meaning car going backwards still true tiny distance traveled little time interval equal velocity times tiny change time number plug velocity would negative tiny change distance negative term thin rectangle rectangle goes horizontal axis like area represent bit distance traveled backwards want find distance start point end point want subtract generally true integral whenever graph dip horizontal axis area underneath negative commonly hear integral measure area graph horizontal axis next bring context idea integral area curve comes along intuition fundamental theorem calculus
