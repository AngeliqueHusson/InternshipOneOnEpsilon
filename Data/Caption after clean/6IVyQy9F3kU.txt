let summarize three different condition sin order two triangle similar different sizes everything else really informal definition easy way us remember looking trying identify similar apply definition say similar triangle similar triangle similar triangle similar triangle sand even turn still similar let talk formal definition know actually prove two triangle sare similar two triangle similar matching angle congruent matching sides said angle sides let talk angle first remember angle measure triangle n change size three interior angle triangle always going add angle measure similar triangle order let talk order triangle similar triangle n exactly size know side length triangle double size side length word take side length one triangle match associated side length triangle able reduce fraction ratio let summarize three different two triangle angle measure side length exactly mean congruent second angle side length proportional similar finally either angle different side length proportional triangle n congruent similar similar triangle similar triangle similar triangle
