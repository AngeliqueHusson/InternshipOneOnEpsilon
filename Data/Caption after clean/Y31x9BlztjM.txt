hi welcome math antic video gon na learn something cal led prime factorization wow pretty complicated n n worry bad name prime factorization probably guess involve factor ing like learned last video word prime mean well help understand let use learned last video factor number seven let see could get seven four factor ing add get number multiply well since ca n think would work let find factor testing divisibility gon na really fast calculator got thats interesting two n leave remainder one seven kind obvious know multiply number get number n factor seven right seven special kind number cal led prime number prime number exactly two one lot list less twenty two three five seven eleven thirteen seventeen nineteen use often might wondering one n alist prime number swell one lot like prime number technical considered prime way special ca n factor well unless use obvious factor number special anyway need know well prime like whole fact whole prime cal led composite composed get multiplying prime together good way see works list prime less let composite less first composite number get multiplying times next composite number get multiplying times next composite number get multiplying times composite number made multiplying could keep going like would see made multiplying different combination prime combination sis cal led prime factorization composite number ah prime factorization thing set prime multiply together get another number true also use term prime factorization action describe find prime composite number made thats going next going use prime factorization action find prime factorization set prime factor number mean continue factor going use something cal led factor tree factor tree diagram help keep track multiple factor ing factor number write two factor going factor one factor thing see works example let get star ted times done right well yet prime factorization need keep going factor let see well know prime number times prime bring first see prime factorization two times two times three know thinking factor times wan ted factor times k let try way time start factor ing remember need factor let see well prime bring first step see three prime factor exact got first time mean matter whichway start factor ing long factor way prime always end group prime factor let try one make sure got let find prime factorization well first step factor ing see even number divide get first two factor divided factor prime cant factor memorize multiplication table might recognize one answer get multiplying times factor times n remember could done divisibility test would figured k well prime mean bring first step see prime factorization times times right know know use prime factorization find set prime factor composite number set prime factorization confuse usual important practice learned video get good practice section good luck thanks watching math antic see math antic calm
