let say weve got pool water drop rock middle pool water little later little wave formed moving radially outward drop ped rock let see well draw moving radially outwards ripple formed dropping rock water circle centered rock initially hit water let say right moment radius circle equal centimeter sand also know radius increasing rate centimeter per second radius growing rate centimeter per second given right circle ripple circle radius centimeter sand know radius growing centimeter per second given rate area growing rate area circle let think know dont know trying figure call radius r know right r equal also know rate r respect time also know information right r rate radius respect time centimeter per second need figure outwell say rate area circle growing need figure rate area circle area circle rate growing need figure might useful come relationship area circle radius circle maybe take derivative respect time well use little bit chain rule relationship given point time area circle radius circle well elementary geometry area circle going equal pi times radius circle squared want figure rate area respect dont take derivative sides respect time let give little real estate actually let rewrite pi r squared area equal pi r square dim going take derivative sides respect derivative respect taking derivative respect rim taking derivative respect left hand side right reim going derivative area actually let write green going derivative area respect time left hand side right hand side well taking derivative constant times something take constant let pi times derivative respect time r make little bit clearer chain rule assuming r function time r wasnt function time wouldnt function instead writing r let make explicit function time ill write r r squaring want find derivative respect time apply chain rule taking derivative something squared respect something derivative something squared respect something going times something first power let make clear derivative r squared respect r derivative something squared respect something derivative x squared respect x wed derivative r squared respect r doesnt get us derivative respect time derivative respect r derivative respect time multiply times rate r respect rate r respect time well could write r equivalent expression sand course pi front want emphasize chain rule right derivative something squared respect time going derivative something squared respect something thats times something times derivative something respect time cant emphasize enough right chain rule chain rule left pi times equal derivative area respect time let rewrite clean little bit derivative area respect time equal pi times actually let put front equal times pi times switch back calling r know r function ill write pi times r times r tactually let make r pi r r know know r know r moment right time r know r right centimeter per second know centimeter per second whats da going equal going equal green times times times times thats purple times centimeter per second let make sure get right centimeter times centimeter going dark color going square centimeter centimeter square centimeter per second exact need change area da equal da rate area respect time equal piso going little bit centimeter squared per second right moment yep times piso pi centimeter squared per second fast area done
