voice let say got triangle side length b equal whatever measurement say side right side right length cand happen equal nine want figure length side side length need figure going equal wont able figure unless also know angle could bring blue side green side close together would small angle would need know angle well let say know angle call theta equal figure ai encourage pause try well lucky us law give us way deter mining third side know two sides angle law cosine tell us squared going equal b squared plus c squared dealing pure right triangle degree would hypotenuse would done would theorem law cosine give us adjustment theorem arbitrary angle law cosine tell us squared going b squared plus c squared minus two times cosine theta theta angle open side care use theta looking gave us another angle right thats angle would care angle open side going solve let solve know b c theta actually squared going equal b squared going equal c squared plus two times b times c minus two ill write minus two times times nine times cosine degree sand going equal see see times nine times two times cosine degree snow let get calculator order approximate remember squared actually get calculator outlet solve going square root going equal square root business copy paste going equal square root let copy paste going equal square root use calculator figure outlet increase radical little bit make sure taking square root whole thing let get calculator want find square root let make sure degree mode degree mode trig function degree thats fine let exit going minus cosine degree snot degree degree sand deserve drum roll going say wan ted round nearest tenth get approximation would approximately approximately equal whatever long
