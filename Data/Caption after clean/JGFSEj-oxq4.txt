right another example rational function suppose want graph x minus x squared minus k let think domain function domain function x squared minus would real except basically equation x squared minus except equal dont want divide well x squared minus could factor x minus x plus equal domain would x except positive also negative k notice well notice plug back original formula well get also get bottom make undefined get remember mean hole graph notice plug negative numerator negative negative denominator get remember get nonzero number thats gon na mean asymptote couple thing think keep mind theres hole graph x equal three theres vertical asymptote x equal negative notice original function two actually simplify x minus three x squared minus nine well denominator factor x minus three x plus three could cancel x minus three wed left x plus really graph ing function gim graph ing function well call g x x plus also remember theres hole x equal mean star ted function x plus would beno problem would take original function account would undefined say say hey graph one x plus remember hole x well remember x kind function kind goes know bottom third quadrant kind also hanging first quadrant remember replace x x plus three thats going shift left thats said vertical asymptote negative theres let see g x equal x figure graph plug plug would get well say thats right point thats missing graph would comma got basic except everything little bit let see plug would get would little higher obviously look little look little bigger quite scale otherwise general shape graph would go would go intercept x wed little open circle would still kind hanging bottom left region would go negative infinity would level x axis move left basic idea take x move left make recognition would x well would plug make hole youve got youve got graph
