hi coming another math video help boost score math class improve understanding hopefully make learning math lot less stressful going talk video write summation sigma notation lot question like write sum like series sequence way alist series sum want want write summation sum compact call sigma notation letter want variable index said equal meaning first term going tobe equal gon na work way sequentially order get nth term last term show mean let look example first example notice happening two time get next term need formula term sequence going going use arithmetic k sequence formula basically first term plus common difference times n first term keep n minus times going n minus plus n plus test see getting n know getting working series links check main thing write compact sigma notation well formula find term plus going say n equal term saying well n well use letter want could rewrite equal plus could say k equal k plus notice whatever variable k know somebody look know tha tokay start put times plus plus cave e sigma mean summation use put k times plus keep working way get top number put plus add together k right running next one pattern like getting term term term multiplying right gon na going say formula times say times start hundred multiply half half wan ted get one two three fourth term actually multiply twice three times less actual term mon turn number four equal top number well said infinity right going see ellipsis mean keep going gon na infinite series goes alright last example one n fit arithmetic pattern thing n fit geometric pattern multiplying dividing thing time one unique pattern see one half plus forth notice numerator keep going denominator keep going one going going write like going say n n plus formula term n equal seethe first term n equal second term way turn n equal denominator always one numerator n plus compact representation write summation k series sum term nice compact form hope video hope learned something subscribe channel check past video see next video writing summation sigma notation writing summation sigma notation writing summation sigma notation
