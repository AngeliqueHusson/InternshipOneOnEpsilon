hey everybody welcome second video exponent first video gave brief introduction went video want go negative exponent top fraction previous video went like squared mean multiply times times equal squared equal negative well youve never seen negative exponent think natural logic would positive positive negative exponent would negative use logic going completely wrong solve negative exponent swell first thing going solve negative exponent x multiplying change athing negative exponent exactly times negative exponent dont multiply like teaching make easier see whats happening later problem question solve negative exponent sand like make negative exponent positive one thing remember negative exponent numerator positive exponent denominator negative exponent numerator right bere written positive exponent denominator everything else stays one numerator stays dont exponent three squared one three x two times equal times three negative exponent equal right let go another example let say negative exponent say negative exponent going touse idea want take negative exponent make positive going use rule except way time going use opposite way negative exponent denominator positive exponent numerator negative exponent denominator positive exponent cant forget one also numerator aswell multiplying kind redundant doesnt change problem simplified squared equal times times equal negative exponent equal positive right let go another example time negative going erase everything negative negative exponent remember negative exponent numerator positive exponent denominator negative negative numerator written negative positive denominator everything else stays numerator stays fraction simplified even negative exponent negative two times numerator negative times negative going give us positive numerator reduced negative negative exponent cant simplified answer right let go one example time fraction think good idea let say negative exponent going multiply negative exponent exactly times negative exponent let get rid negative exponent negative exponent numerator positive exponent denominator right negative numerator could rewrite positive exponent denominator everything else stays one numerator stays numerator denominator squared times times everything else stays still numerator simplify denominator times equal times equal numerator dividing one fraction whenever dividing fraction multiplying reciprocal dividing fraction multiplying reciprocal could simplified even times final answer hope gave better idea negative exponent fraction next video going talk exponent stay tuned really hope enjoying see next one
