video want couple example apply ing rule going little complicated combining lots know thing seen one new simplify remember know multiplying like bases x n times x well added exponent swith rule said instead multiplying division well multiplication say add exponent swell division end corresponding exponent two ways think basically combine taking base take top exponent minus bottom exponent would go fraction think likewise take leave thing bottom subtract away exponent top make use rule property say remember x x raised negative exponent rewrite x positive little tricky definitely think place go wrong hopefully k got first example squared fourth fifth seventh third first rule say parentheses multiply exponent one times five would fifth would x squared fifth take two times five give us x tenth since four five multiply give us power bottom stick little exponent would raised third power x cube multiply give us power power people start multiplying times little bit times get big number take get guess start simplify ing much easier use straight away help simplify going way personal preference always take top minus bottom maybe let kind show maybe make see three base one thing simply take top exponent minus bottom exponent would x minus taking top minus bottom would leave top exponent subtract away bottom exponent minus think basically move everything let see going us second power thats going give us x first power going give us minus going give us negative first power think divided one n change value typically people n want see negative exponent people want see positive exponent since everything something important plus es minus es inside careful know moving thing around everything top one thing long thing bottom long multiplication move squared going give x first give us x negative first put denominator becomes positive first power could simply write x would solution typically know kind skip step know maybe look another way think little faster thing look three see bigger exponent top take bigger number minus smaller number minus bigger exponent stay side fraction k likewise x x bigger exponent top know x going stay top fraction take bigger number minus smaller number would look bigger exponent going live bottom fraction take bigger number minus give first power squared personal preference like take bigger minus smaller wherever bigger exponent variable stay base way kind step shuffle thing around everything end correctly right place n know road lead whichever way let set second example well squared fourth squared sixth thing would get five fourth multiply stick x first would get x fourth two four eighth power bottom one x six six x two times six first raised sixth power multiply give us sixth power going trick sho wed end going going hopefully put thing correct place look fives fives like bases combine look exponent well bigger four going stay bottom take six minus four going second power likewise look x next x fourth x squared well x exponent bigger exponent x going bottom take minus give x last thing got base sixth k well bigger exponent numerator swill stay top thing minus second power usually kind simplification numerical part got squared squared x left would original expression would simplify alright couple different ways look hope n confuse think lot algebra math general finding away works know definitely feel free use either way eventually get correct answer apply ing rule exponent basic example apply ing rule exponent basic example apply ing rule exponent basic example
