right video going example graph ing hyperbola going graph x minus squared equal depending whether form x squared minus squared equal squared minus x squared equal going open know different way weve got x squared minus squared going look like parabola open know left right cover one right dont really thing kind information need value need b value need c value think make decent little graph squared going equal take square root would get positive negative going keep positive value v squared would well take square going keep positive solution going use b know relationship c squared equal squared plus b squared squared denominator x squared term b squared denominator squared term c squared going plus say c squared going look like know could always simplify little bit solve c going make square root keeping positive solution dont know square root break much certainly divisible two like would get two times would give us well really doesnt factor much fact doesnt really factor mean always make thats going help us break square root going use c value square root right go graph well come back second say equal negative b equal positive b case asymptote going positive negative b positive negative five seventh x aslope one would kind kind go degree angle little bit little bit less steep usually graph asymptote first theres equal positive five likewise would equal negative five say asset vertices occur positive zero negative vertices going occur seven comma zero also point negative seven comma zero really point tome youve almost got everything need decent little graph graph basically hyperbola going get closer closer asymptote thing go go right getting closer asymptote get closer asymptote thats let see one thing could always sigh theyre said c value square root one foci would positive square root comma zero would sitting point negative square root comma zero graph doesnt go folk sticking little x layer indicate hyperbola doesnt go point kind useful information fighting foe side right point think weve got little graph would call day
