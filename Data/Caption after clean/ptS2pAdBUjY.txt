hi coming another math video help boost score math class improve understanding hopefully make math less stressful lesson going talk binomial probability binomial probability work well binomial probability two thing happen like either win like know make shot miss shot like success failure like one option know head tail kind thing take look formula got n choose k p k times minus p n minus k well n represent trial number times flip coin know basket shot take whatever working p p represent probability success decimal chance success minus p probability failure success rate mean percent failure rate add right percent k represent know success es wondering probability know make know basket basket number minus k would number failure well look example show mean let take look first one make basketball shot take probability make exactly shot let look one basically taking ten going want make right choose know probability making basket want make nine probability missing making shot point three zero one simplify choose factorial factorial factorial first simplify divided factorial going simplify going give let look another example probability coin times get head exactly seeing saying know exactly idea going going say times see n want get head exactly seven times sok know flip coin two know either going land head going want get head times course getting head would also getting tail would simplify quantity get probability decimal convert want talk percent chance factorial factorial factorial simplify rest work binomial probability remember two option success failure use formula hope enjoying video hope learning something getting something go ahead subscribe channel take look past video got coming stay talk next video binomial probability binomial probability binomial probability
