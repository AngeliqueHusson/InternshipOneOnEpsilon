r jam es grime today going talk one great unsolved problem mathematics went back ancient thousand year ago eventually solve problem cal led squaring circle may even hear problem metaphor something thats impossible question make square area circle understand rule sin ancient gree ce didnt algebra could construct could make thing straight edge like ruler measured ruler straight edge compass circle rule ancient work rule construct square area look rule compasses add line length add another line length band whole thing plus b add together quite easily subtract well start b mark length call bit thats going b minus awe multiply draw little triangle length length aim going scale triangle scale length b big triangle b scaled well length times b divide idea reverse took bigger triangle length b long edge length scale length scaled well scale length divided b divide scaling triangle well theres one thing draw line aim going add thats going draw semicircle length square root thats ruler compass add multiply divide subtract workout square root make rule repeated use make say circle radius area circle pi times radius radius squared thats area circle piso want square want square area may ahead square pi length sides square root square root pi square theres nothing yet say cant whats problem well know pi irrational actually wasnt easy work worked quite recently quite recently mean irrational enough constructible irrational make square root quite easily make square root square root irrational enough say cant make bit general use root like cube root nth root add aswell make rule algebraic bit general idea turns able prove pi algebraic number algebraic number definitely constructible number like word number algebraic cal led transcendental number fantastic word prove something transcendental really hard fact mathematician shown seven year even found example transcendental number imagine seven year people saying mathematician show transcendental number come show transcendental number really hard thing eventually found example still wait able prove pi done weve shown weve shown pi proof square square circle given rule game could computer square circled r jam es grime make square sides length root modern day people tool algebra algebra fantastic people complain algebra algebra school didnt algebra would math like ancient math si promise would much much worse textbook would wordy algebra amazing powerful tool mathematics cause reason brilliant easy make square area pi rule straight impossible say easy make square area pi pi nature continue cant even get exact figure surely cant square thats exactly pi dont even know pi youd r jam es grime treading something cal led paradox second video row going tell wait find jam es grime thats way want play thats choice stringing along representative actually passe unanimously passe weird day passing bill
