video want talk finding sum finite remember arithmetic sequence sequence listing go one number number theres constant difference notice listing made every time get next number thats example call arithmetic sequence start actually together thats whats cal led arithmetic series series something term formula say sit say sum sub n first arithmetic series look sub n arithmetic series formula sub n sub represent first term sequence series plus n minus two sum n term number term multiply first term plus last term divide equivalently take number bracket times first term plus n minus times common difference common difference would say value thats madding get next term divide kind quick put formula suppose start looking arithmetic sequence arithmetic three three three three three time common difference ad value three going going find sum first term going find sum series starting term ending kind stuff going add one formula think use one right part let erase erase part b actually want point well first plus plus know weve got formula calculate sub wan ted could plug equivalently going use formula remark want make many term upwell certainly going kind play second problem pointing start first term soak end tenth term notice subtract index minus get keep mind going revisit second example idea think people make mistake k think pretty use formula right take number term said say take first term well first termin case take number subtract one multiply common difference case three simply divide two little careful order let see times minus times thats going divided divided going give us say add get sum bad certainly use formula compute sub n formula kind first page show get thing well write add term see get second part problem theres many different ways could use second part problem going keep mind said got part part b wan ted add term starting term think said term k going use formula hereon right little bit careful plug term thats going sub thats well start would add term term way term case formula number term case careful saying second ago cant take minus correct going whew remember said add well count certainly get subtract get minus idea get number subtract index es add going get correct number term minus plus term going add simply going compute first number going plug right sub one original series would first term new series thats idea said sub n going first term calculate eleventh term go back original really think thing coming sub say take first term take n minus one going times common difference case three plus thats actually going put sub excuse list term original sequence would find get eleventh term thats get number going use original formula think crucial information said theres going tobe one certainly little first one pretty term say set sum term say going tobe n take two times first term would take n minus would minus original value divide right divided times thats times thats look like times whats going check arithmetic think going better yes much better right second problem little kind thing starting middle really figure first term would case would term thats careful count number use formula part b might little may watch couple times course always really stop think know think anything certainly think ways thats simply one way right hope example make sense help comment feel free post hopefully somebody else point right direction
