hi welcome math antic sin last video learned circle learned special ratio cal led pi video going learn use ratio calculate circumference area formula use calculate circumference area important really memorize help going look help see difference dont get mixed formula finding circumference circumference equal pi times diameter like formula use abbreviation c circumference diameter thats pretty simple formula tell us know diameter circle multiply diameter times number pi well get circumference well try formula first let see formula area formula finding area circle area equal pi times radius squared use abbreviation make area r radius pretty simple formula tell us know radius square multiply times pi get mean square radius well squaring number mean multiplying example squared mean times squared mean times r squared mean r times r formula really area equal pi times r times r write r squared form compact oh one really important thing keep mind r squared thing times r thats common mistake student make first learning find area circle look carefully formula see two formula lot common multiplying pi part circle find either circumference area case circumference multiplying pi times diameter case area multiplying pi times radius squared remember relationship radius diameter diameter times radius could rewrite formula circumference like circumference pi r ha see easy get confused find circumference take radius double multiply pi get final answer area dont double square thats important difference help see difference find circumference area circle two thing know circle radius thats need know first use formula circumference c pi get diameter take radius double multiply diameter multiply pi get circumference since decimal multiplication going use mean circumference circle let find area formula pi times r squared start radius instead doubling square mean multiply squared multiply squared thats area circle see result get square radius different result get double one important difference answer doubling radius give us diameter quantity answer get formula circumference also quantity square radius give us square make sense area always help avoid getting two formula mixed one radius squared always area alright let try couple real world example make sure youve got real world probably know sphere take slice world right equator slice find circumference need know diameter earth turns find circumference need multiply diameter times definitely going use calculator going use accurate version pi since big k nearest kilometer wow thats pretty big circumference wonder take long go way around get yes second quick er last time another real world example circle pizza diameter inch es whats total area well formula start squaring radius problem give us gave us diameter calculate radius diameter fortunately thats really easy radius half diameter need divide diameter inch es divided give us inch es radius know radius need square inch es squared next multiply total area pizza square know know find circumference area circle need remember equal pi times diameter area equal pi times radius squared really important practice formula sure try exercise way really learn math thanks watching math antic ill see ya next time learn
