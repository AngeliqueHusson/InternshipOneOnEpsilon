right video one example finding center radius circle going going square rewrite equation put center radius form going start plus squared minus minus first thing going make little manageable kind one observation theyre even certainly divide two think even better believe four go thats first thing going simply going divide everything left four also divide right four well four x four x squared four squared four positive squared negative would negative positive would positive negative divided negative divided going next going kind regroup thing little bit going put going next notice x squared weve got negative weve got positive squared hanging weve got positive thing going add right side kind imagine know going stick x set parentheses theres coefficient dont worry stuff reim going give little space thing wise going give little space square say coefficient linear term negative case negative take negative square give us positive number kind magically throw inside parentheses plus thing well see take coefficient give us positive squared positive going add left side set parentheses right side already really left side left side added added got right side well almost squared minus plus x minus squared squared plus plus factor plus squared let see another put familiar center radius form center circle going positive negative radius circle simply going square root times doesnt really break would probably know leave square little tedious hopefully terribly bad
