imaginary real part introduction let say given function f x graph function get nice parabola let say want figure equation equal want find root son plot function see parabola actually never x axis according plot solution equation small problem little year ago smart guy name gauss proved every polynomial equation degree exactly n root sour polynomial highest power degree two two root sand gauss discovery random rule today call fundamental theorem algebra plot seem disagree something important cal led fundamental theorem algebra might problem telling us two perfectly good value x could plug function get zero could missing root short answer n enough typically think exist ing dimensional continuum number friend negative fraction even irrational like root show system incomplete missing left right live whole new dimension algebraically new everything problem mathematically considered impossible two thousand year square root negative one include missing dimension analysis parabola get way interesting input full two dimensional form see function really behave sand see function exactly two root looking wrong dimension extra dimension possess common knowledge part reason given terrible terrible name suggest n ever real fact gauss something say naming convention yes missing dimension comprised given ridiculous name imaginary gauss propose instead given name let let lateral mean imaginary get better handle imaginary mean lateral really understand going let spend little time thinking human really use natural make sense used early human number line would series civilization advanced people answer sophisticated math question plant seed divide land keep track financial natural cutting innovate dand new high tech solution filled gap number line basically cutting edge technology couple thousand next big innovation hit number line number zero negative took time get everyone board since obvious mean fit real world zero negative met skepticism largely voided culture suspicious depending largely people vie wed connection mathematics reality ancient history ago mathematician would intentionally move term around avoid negative show zero negative eventually fade partially negative useful concept like debt mostly negative kept sneaking turns whole lot math allow negative play without negative simple algebra problem like x answer negative accepted problem would solution like thought original problem solution thing crazy weird think problem like solution word algebra problem basically say thing take away many thing left surprising people lived planet would suspicious question like problem make much sense even brilliant mathematician century really know negative one point wrote negative greater infinity fair say negative imaginary raise lot good valid require student understand work elude mind thousand year even come accept negative imaginary first place really seem connected anything real world extra help explain missing solution problem next time begin address going way back discovery imaginary imaginary real part introduction imaginary real part introduction imaginary real part introduction
