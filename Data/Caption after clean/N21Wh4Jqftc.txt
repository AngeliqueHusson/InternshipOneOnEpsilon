let figure minus order able need find common denominator notice theyre common right denominator common denominator going least common multiple share common factor least common multiple actually going times going leave written times let first try rewrite right ill denominator first denominator going write times multiply denominator order change value fraction need multiply numerator times notice numerator denominator number thats equivalent multiplying still equivalent let one blue right common denominator want times denominator multiply let write times times multiply denominator multiply numerator well ill write numerator times numerator denominator numerator denominator know multiply common denominator times denominator numerator common denominator times multiply get multiply numerator well ready subtract might say hey sal hold wait actually evaluate maybe thats good figure first equal times see times plus times see havent memorize times tables know times put one get exact thing numerator denominator going subtract times times overwell already figured times times common denominator rewrite equal minus write neutral color see minus would less going going equal far tell let go make sure somehow magically multiple could simplify let see almost maybe let see go times times see difference actually could gone one let eight times times remainder doesnt go evenly divisible dont share common weve simplified much equal
