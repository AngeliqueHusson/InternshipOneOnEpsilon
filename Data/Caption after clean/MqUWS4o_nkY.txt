got lot message comment people video cantor diagonal proof suggesting following take infinite list rational prove ca n ever contain rational take one key digit number make new real number different every key digit therefore list matter list ca n reverse process try make list whole prove whole whole going diagonal reverse cantor kind like line thinking one hand mathematical way thinking proof seem prove one thing weird probably test see weird everything end weird might flaw premise thinking maybe everything actually hand n like line thinking remind slippery slope fallacy one like well argument works case would n work general case know stop wed better allow first place actually logical mathematical argument n prove actually apply general case reverse cantor argument actually apply take one digit number infinite list whole change n get something ca n list thus proving list incomplete well get something list part reasoning correct let try every list item decimal place number many list item decimal place infinite number mean number construct ing infinite going left conflict corresponding list number nth decimal place list whole infinite include arbitrarily large approaching infinity real number counting number whole number actually stop somewhere end infinite point number construct ing doesnt stop infinite going left order conflict every number every decimal place infinite list also real number real infinite going right combination right infinitely last digit actually exactly pi never end random roll infinite dice number different number one digit randomly change many proof work real decimal real ca n infinite going left counting infinity n get certainly n go past problem interesting think might mean extend real include infinite left video kind infinity going left n work way real n actually represent infinite number could represent infinite like run difficult question show define number bigger smaller number ca n compare leftmost digit leftmost digit equal simply infinity add normal way n weird leftmost digit get carried gone think probably devolve add sides get break mathematics definitely ca n arithmetic obvious way maybe infinitely large number different plain nice concept find way make work like want different might trouble maybe special case avoid way avoid dividing zero algebra work play want going bed reverse cantor reverse cantor reverse cantor
