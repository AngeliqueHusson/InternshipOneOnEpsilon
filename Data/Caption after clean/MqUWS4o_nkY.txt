got lot message comment people video cantor diagonal proof suggesting following take infinite list rational prove cant ever contain rational take one key digit number make new real number thats different every key digit therefore list matter list cant reverse process try make list whole number sand prove theres whole whole going diagonal kind like line thinking one hand mathematical way thinking proof seem prove one thing weird probably test see weird everything end weird might flaw premise thinking maybe everything actually hand dont like line thinking remind slippery slope fallacy thats one like well argument works case wouldnt work general case know stop wed better allow first place thats actually logical mathematical argument dont prove actually apply general case reverse cantor argument actually apply take one digit number infinite list whole change shouldnt get something cant list thus proving list incomplete well get something list part reasoning try every list item decimal place number theres many list item decimal place theres infinite number mean number construct ing infinite going left conflict corresponding list nth decimal place list whole infinite include arbitrarily large approaching infinity real number counting number whole number actually stop somewhere end infinite point number construct ing doesnt stop infinite going left order conflict every number every decimal place infinite list also real number real infinite going right combination right infinitely last digit actually exactly pi never end random roll infinite dice number different number one digit randomly change thats many proof work real decimal real cant infinite going left counting infinity dont get certainly dont go past problem interesting think might mean extend real include infinite left video kind infinity going left dont work way real doesnt actually represent infinite number could represent infinite like youd run difficult question show define themis number bigger smaller number cant compare leftmost digit leftmost digit equal simply infinity add normal way weird leftmost digit get carried gone think probably devolve add sides get break mathematics definitely cant arithmetic obvious way maybe infinitely large number thats different plain nice concept find way make work like want different might trouble maybe special case avoid way avoid dividing zero algebra work play want going bed
