today look surface area volume sphere draw sphere dotted portion seen front center sphere let r radius dont forget every point sphere equidistant center define surface area sphere surface area sphere equal pi r sphere one type surface area total surface area curved surface area flat surface volume sphere given pi r cube moment need know formulae cover topic sure one video higher grade mathematics know formula sphere easily derive formulae hemisphere hemisphere hemisphere half sphere let say radius r got sphere horizontally looking bottom part best way understand hemisphere looking earth equator earth two hemisphere northern hemisphere southern hemisphere split earth equator get like k great back figure notice looking hemisphere first thing notice flat surface curved surface tell us sphere hemisphere different curved surface area total surface area let look curved surface area first looking figure easily say half surface area sphere dividing two get two pi r square thats curved surface area total surface area total surface area sum area curved surface area circle top figured area curved surface pi r squared area circle top pi r two get pi r squared curved surface area pi r squared total surface area r squared volume volume hemisphere exactly half volume sphere dividing get r
