video going looking function well well extreme maximum maximum value function value range minimum value going afunction value range call extreme value function sometimes maximum minimum value instead need look call mean situation restrict domain may relative minimum relative maximum value look look example first example say look graph ask find maximum would none graph look goes infinitely goes infinitely maximum value minimum value going could restrict domain maybe restrict domain section case restrict domain would relative minimum value maybe restrict domain piece section well case relative maximum b next example next example goes infinitely end goes infinitely end well mean case minimum value case minimum value going c lo west point range maximum value goes infinitely could restrict domain us relative maximum minimum value example could restrict domain section would relative minimum would c could restrict domain section case would relative minimum e could restrict domain give minimum g could also restrict domain get relative maximum value one could restrict domain section case maximum could restrict section give relative maximum value f situation value maximum well could situation minimum like next one next one goes infinitely minimum value see maximum value h could also say relative maximum value h could restrict domain also refer relative maximum one relative minimum like theres spot could restrict domain would dip graph would vertex might say well could restrict domain like would n point relative minimum point vertex n way need look slash example last example unique see goes infinitely infinitely minimum maximum value way restrict domain meeting get minimum relative maximum value one unique known maximum minimum value also relative maximum minimum let look let look first example considered graph function x cube minus minus right tell us maximum occur x approximately negative minimum occur x approximately want ascribe f increasing one thing important know read graph left right look graph left right ked us figure graph increasing well increasing get closer negative hit x negative decrease get x goes back increasing increasing increasing x less negative one point three interval negative one point three increasing look left right also increasing x greater one point three read well let look f decreasing f decreasing going segment going x negative one point three x positive one point three way would write would say x negative one point three one point three let look example together say consider graph function negative two third x x five x right key point letter want figure letter label sand interval h negative well answer going negative look graph graph negative section interval h sare going negative value going negative way describe letter label sand could say x less value answer value going negative going x c x e x x c e negative x bigger value g answer also going negative would describe like would say x going less awe gon na say x c x greater g interval value h going negative letter interval h positive well going two section well two section saying x going go c c two point value positive point e g value sare also positive say x e g describe actually going end video looking maximum minimum value looking somehow identify interval graph next section video next part video watching going looking going looking find function stop video go ahead watch next video learn find polynomial lesson part finding polynomial lesson part finding polynomial lesson part finding polynomial
