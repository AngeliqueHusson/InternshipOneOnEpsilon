let write arithmetic sequence general start number keep number keep could positive negative number call common difference second term sequence plus third term sequence plus keep way nth termin sequence already see first term added zero second term added third term added twice see whatever index term one less many times go way nth term going add one less n times going n minus times fair enough let write right nth term want think sum arithmetic sequence would sum arithmetic sequence call arithmetic series let write yellow color sometimes difficult arithmetic series sum arithmetic sequence let call arithmetic series sub let say going sum going plus plus plus plus way nth term plus n minus going trick basic arithmetic going add swap order write sum sub n write write reverse going write last term first nth term plus n minus times second last term going plus n minus times third last going plus n minus times dand going go way first term let add two going get left hand side sub n plus going get times sub n well whats sum two first reim going plus plus n minus times going plus n minus times let add second add second get going get plus whats plus n minus times could view several ways let write plus n minus times dwell plus n minus times dand could add going n minus plus times equal n minus times second term also becomes plus n minus times let add third term ill third term say think going see pattern plus plus n minus something add going n minus one something plus n minus times dand going keep way nth pair term way add two character plus n minus times plus n minus added many times well n pair term two equation sin n first term second term third term way nth term rewrite times sum sub n going n times quantity going n times plus n minus times dand want solve sub n divide sides get sub n equal get little bit drum roll times plus n minus times weve come general formula function first term common difference many term generalized sum arithmetic sequence call arithmetic series let ask question hard remember n times plus n minus times last video concrete example said well look like sum arithmetic sequence could written perhaps average first term plus average first term last number term actually two thing gel easy remember average first last term number term actually sense increasing amount every let average first last term multiply times number term well rewrite little see indeed exact thing break let rewrite could written sub n equal n times plus plus n minus times di broke plus see based defined thing first term last term sub n plus n minus times whole business right really average first last term si got first term last term dividing multiplying number term thats true arithmetic sequence weve shown
