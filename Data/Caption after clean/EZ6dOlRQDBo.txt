consider triangle let call triangle know exterior triangle simple extend one side let us produce side b c like since weve extended b c mean b also straight line thats angle exterior angle angle exterior triangle cal led exterior angle know three angle interior time look respect exterior angle first let look angle angle know interior triangle adjacent exterior angle respect exterior angle angle interior adjacent angle two angle angle bac interior region triangle adjacent exterior angle cal led interior let try derive interesting relation exterior interior let erase form new triangle let call extend side b c point convenience let us name one two three exterior one four know sum interior angle triangle degree sum angle one plus angle two plus angle three sum equal guess sum exterior angle would measure angle plus measure angle equal notice figure carefully see form straight line yes form linear pair sum would degree expression degree mean equal say angle plus plus angle equal angle plus angle subtract ing measure sides say plus angle equal angle angle exterior angle angle interior opposite angle exterior angle triangle always equal sum interior opposite angle
