let talk unit measurement cal led gram gram unit measurement measuring mass well might seen everyday language someone might look feather let see draw good feather feather like say hey massive massive notice word mass might point big boulder big heavy boulder let draw big heavy boulder say massive massive example might get intuition mass much stuff related weight said related weight thing weight later take physics learn mass weight related exactly thing given planet distance center planet roughly speaking mass strongly related mass going weight two thing mass planet distance center planet going weight often hear people say many gram thing weigh really saying many gram thing mass long stay ing earth roughly know sea level plus minus little bit even little bit away sea level mass weight crazy hold little bit interchangeable one way gauge something hold say much weigh something weigh mass going something mass going going weigh assuming planet take physics class learn different concept closely related gram another thing see context mass measuring mass kilogram kilogram going seethe prefix kilo guess education especially thinking kilo prefix literally mean instead saying gram could say kilogram way let see get sense one different gram might mass one kilogram kilogram kilogram sand exactly got picture prepared want get sense something mass one gram think paper clip little squiggly thing right mean roughly every paper clip going exactly gram might gram might paper clips gram give sense would mass want know much something mass gram weigh surface earth well could hold paper clip kind judge feel much hand much weight pushing hand guess could say want get sense little bit massive pencil five times massive paper clip hopefully see hold five paper one side pencil side see roughly mass weight roughly little bit massive could think field field mouse equivalent mass roughly pencil want get even massive think kitten kitten couple week still kitten still fully grown cat mass gram sand make rough amount sense imagine thing maybe little field mice imagine mouse size right could better job drawing mouse make sense get even get say gram well start talking kilogram sand clear put g abbreviation gram gram gram gram sand want go gram could think something hard cover textbook like one obviously textbook huge one showing n weigh figure mass exact one would mass kilogram kilogram right gram sa fully grown cat thats kilogram depending fully grown guess big cat pretty interesting fully grown times mass kitten actually make sense fully grown human sare times mass young actually roughly times mass young actually make sense want get even go large ape like human particular one right kilogram actually pretty close actual mass kilogram sand get sense would mean used dealing pound si weigh little kilogram roughly used thinking term unit weight kilogram unit want get even would get times massive human normal sized human might get something like cow cow would mass many paper clips would need mass cow well might temp ted say remember gram mass cow actually would need paper clips mass cow intuition gram measurement geometry grade khan academy intuition gram measurement geometry grade khan academy intuition gram measurement geometry grade khan academy
