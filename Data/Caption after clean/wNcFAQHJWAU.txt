pi pi ratio circumference diameter pi irrational number equal approximately better go part circle first circumference perimeter circle theres diameter line split circle half theres radius half diameter take diameter make circumference circle radius half diameter tick make trampoline circle pi radius es half circle one radian pi angle take one radius area circle pir squared less way think making rectangle separating circle different radius es taking half unfolding theres bunch triangle p lacing two halves together make rectangle reason pi irrational number matter many times separate smaller smaller triangle always going radius bottom every triangle cant account area formula
