following end news seen headline week along scientist discover new shape scientist new shape mean new shape mathematician involved obviously n person wondering people start send message saying mat explain new shape like know want find problem currently travel ling n know generic foreign somewhere world show high school student detail able explore shape see behave indeed new time another installment everyone favorite stand math make shape thing found around place holiday let welcome dining room furnished generic de cor kea offer lot anyway got cardboard found around house got little creature pale ale thankfully got tape found pair scissors able locate pipe cleaner snow member family prism get gon na start shape number prism got collection pentagon cut got hexagon little creature prism got two identical parallel face join vertices going use pipe tha tokay go pentagonal prism hexagonal prism course face filled done edge left empty filled way end filled nothing exciting yet however option making prism actually take pentagonal prism give twist sneak edge original prism hexagonal face face joining twist got twice many edge going around meet vertex mean plus know edge got antiprism two parallel identical face sline rectangle prism hexagonal prism thing skewed use triangle antiprism shape number one prism family antiprism slight detour prismatoid path pyramid know hexagon based pyramid prismatoid n got pair parallel face anywhere could imagine like sliced top put new face would parallel bottom one exactly made frustum two frustum happen get pyramidlike shape lop top works cones well get frustum shape prismatoid yet another variation thing prism antiprism frustum one done put pentagon top hexagon bottom join together well vertices bottom two edge done yellow meet bit patch six vertices bottom five topi used antiprism triangle whereas rest prism rectangle snow math special name back generic name prismatoid right got parallel face four three edge around prismatoid combination bit prismy bit mix two n get special guess final category prismatoid kind everything else one generic prismatoid instead antiprism triangle face way got like got little triangle face got standard single edge coming top could saya prismatoid one end prism prism triangle prismatoid though mean guess important bit bit merge little like v short left v hexagon right stuck middle pretty good good taking five minute taking break ear lier today chat friend laura working print one easy face longer flat got concave bit weird kind edged face longer well behave printing trivial get moment thing meant kind stack together ked basically ked laura went designing model first tried make sort boneheaded thing put vertices shape hexagon shape pentagon extra vertex take convex hull vertices n work sides curvy actually planar face n polyhedron next thing divided object vertically slice kind lof ted slice slice curved nice curved surface going get object nice curvy loo ked like pretty much like picture article however n pack turns location vertices particular location extra vertex really key deter mining whether pack ways constrain make happen final model property pack delete interesting biology well cell biology cell form epithelium layer biologist always assumed would f well obviously distorted prism cell would grow fill space know face end normally middle whenever kind curvature surface distorted frustum truncated pyramid arrangement biologist spotted pattern curvature cell could n truncated pyramid shaped cell got mathematician involved yeah thank goodness mathematician involved biologist saw strange mathematician came thought well would model shape cell would form pac ked various arrangement used well variation thing cal led technique put bunch point space expand fill space region around point point original starting seed point loo ked cell would form trying like minimize energy find stable arrangement pack together efficiently possible came mathematician epithelium cell would different number edge one face compare face edge would merge somewhere middle giving prismatoid arrangement actually lucky enough talk one mathematician involved project knew chat bit found shape based biologist told hey mat first time work together biologist physicist computer scientist sand think role everyone quite important short define new shape observe microscope group leaded biologist discovered usual representation cell epithelial truncated pyramid could explain observe microscope ask us try find correct model first model prediction still accurate change model finally worked fine finally seal approval physicist proved stable pack together mathematics n predict epithelium cell would enough give right curvature case cylinder happen animal apparently kind would certain percentage quite nice built pipe fixed rigid shape right like cube something like quite topology geometry somewhere topology geometry worked structure would require cell give sort found loo ked fruit took mathematician told biologist actually able find inside little creature p phenomenal collaboration biology mathematics may application well chatting said one day look tissue actually let say human know structure expect tell cell growing normally ever make artificial cell need know kind structure form moment abstract exciting read full nature paper want put link publicly available one last bombshell told talking shape give name media officially beetle right name similar shape see chatting turns original reason name funny cute officially part body beetle similar shape hidden reason tell secret biologist leader project cal led escudo escudo joke start call think another name shape bye mat may thanks much watching video video building thing stuff find traveling subscribe channel mathematical needs thank much make video possible come across math news something interesting drop see make video finally show high school student time right across u k new york first time scientist discover new shape scientist discover new shape scientist discover new shape
