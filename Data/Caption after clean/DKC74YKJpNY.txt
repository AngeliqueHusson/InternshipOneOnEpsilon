hi rob welcome math antic sin last basic algebra video learned learned polynomial chain term either added together learned term polynomial number part variable part together remember much polynomial might want watch first video continue go even though basic polynomial pretty simple sometimes come across polynomial complicated really need math like thing complicated simplify video going learn simplify polynomial involve identify ing term similar enough combined single term make polynomial shorter see works look basic polynomial follow easy recognize pattern course last video really need show coefficient term like x zero term also really need show either going leave like minute illustrate point see polynomial term every degree zero four remember polynomial missing term example could slightly different polynomial third degree term make look like x cube term get skip ped missing since pattern goes x fourth skip x cube goes x squared well like missing term polynomial also extra like polynomial third degree term two term x cube variable part polynomial polynomial x cube term fine polynomial one x cube term fine polynomial two x cube term also fine complicated needs whenever term like exact variable combined single term add number part keep variable part one x cube plus one x cube combine form two x cube cal led combining like term like term term exactly variable combine well understand like pretend variable part polynomial term hear fruit example look polynomial let substitute different kind fruit different variable partlet change x cube apple x squared plain x would new fruit polynomial telling us well first term represent apple next term next term last term banana sand added together get add apple apple since different fruit combine sound machine left screen well unless blender middle two term get add mean combine two term single term make fruit polynomial simpler see variable part term exactly order combine variable part different like x cube x squared represent different thing group single term way variable part mathematical reason works way something cal led distributive property subject whole video alright two term polynomial exactly variable part call like term combine single term simplify polynomial help get better identify ing like term let play little game cal led like term like term first pair term consider like term yep variable part term x combine single term number part keeping variable part combined term like term first degree term since variable different letter like mean combine term two x squared negative seven x squared well variable part exactly x squared yes like term combine notice one term negative add number part end negative combine negative five x squared next pair term four x squared six x cube like term nope even tough variable x case exponent different variable part next negative like term well first glance might think variable part term different x different order remember multiplication commutative property order x rewrite look add number part negative plus wind single term five x squared five squared x careful one might think like last one term different order look closely first term x squared second term squared mean even switch order exponent move variable variable part mean like practice identify ing like term let look complicated polynomial simplify combining like term find first example x squared plus six x minus x plus see term variable part yep two term middle variable x combine minus x would give us since remember see number part term polynomial star ted term simplified term x squared plus five x plus try one sixteen minus two x cube plus four x minus ten polynomial degree term degree term two constant term sare constant term like term absolutely really variable part combine easily term positive term negative add together end positive best think term polynomial added coefficient either positive negative negative sign stays two x cube negative term polynomial simple since like even complicated polynomial three x squared plus ten minus three x plus five x squared minus four plus x polynomial six term get long polynomial like first thing look see term like term combine right away may notice two constant term polynomial positive negative let start combining single constant term positive since next see also two degree term negative positive x like term combine negative plus give us negative see also two different term variable part x squared combine x squared plus five x squared give us eight x squared polynomial star ted six term able simplify three term eight x squared minus two x plus almost made algebra seem fun alright know simplify polynomial identify ing combining like term sit sometimes little tricky since complicated polynomial may many different necessarily order degree mean may need rear ranging look term combine like look pair combine combine single term simplified polynomial cross original polynomial know already taken care term combined come simplified polynomial make thing easier forget treat term either positive negative depending sign right front simplify polynomial sand know important practice simplify ing polynomial really understand thanks watching math antic see ya next time learn algebra basic simplify ing polynomial math antic algebra basic simplify ing polynomial math antic algebra basic simplify ing polynomial math antic
