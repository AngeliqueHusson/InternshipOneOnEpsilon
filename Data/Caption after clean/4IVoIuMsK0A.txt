welcome let talk issue drive nut algebra teacher many curriculum memorize formula plug chug answer ing question quadratics topic full memorization example algebra might ask student examine equation x squared minus plus might ask something like many times quadratic across x axis meant know quadratic formula x equal negative b plus minus square root b squared minus allover mention though quantity square root sign interesting basically positive number really take square root get two solution quantity guess call discriminant zero one square root number one square root give one solution quantity happen tobe negative forget trying take solution basically book head answer question many times cross memorize form discriminant go check whether positive negative zero well teach algebra yes derive quadratic formula memorize never know mean know never ask memorize b squared minus much rather test understand quadratics rather testing memorize formula ask question many times x squared minus plus cross x axis well picture thousand word let draw thing pretty easy like focus let focus x equation clearly second factor x apart x times x minus still plus well tell looking x equal x equal interesting something interest going something interesting going put former get plus graph high put x equal former get plus symmetrical graph u shaped symmetrical maybe like maybe dip course maybe touch nice see picture x equal action going everything symmetrical let plug x equal original formula get minus plus actually hi graph must actually like staring picture many times across x axis times yes admit b squared minus quick er interested speed much rather interested understanding let try another one maybe weird algebra teacher goes let try equal negative squared plus plus many times cross x axis right going focus interesting x value pull add let focus x part see negative common leaves x behind minus thats another plus five right x equal x equal interesting fact put big term goes plus two point symmetrical point symmetrical graph actually negative tell thing downward tell without ado must cross many times across x axis times picture speak thousand word well towards two times algebra book like really test handle sort beginner giving interesting question interesting subjective term squared plus plus k maybe question find value k graph touch es going sketch thing picture speak thousand word si gon na look interesting x focus x part equation anything oh see common factor four x pull x store plus around tell x equal x equal negative interesting negative put formula put negative get part plus k sure k two k hi squared tell upward facing u shaped grass going something like coming upward question fired k touch es x axis want come touch x x like well everything symmetrical know action going happen negative want picture value k put negative alright let put x see would equal times negative squared plus times plus k equal minus plus k tell k equal tricklet fourth example guess could example form another type question n really seen algebra book testing understanding negative squared group plus loop x plus k scrawly writing sorry find value x negative squared plus plus k value right time grab value choose k make happen alright well draw picture good wave start drawing picture focus interesting let focus x part pul led may negative leaves behind x anda negative stuff plus k right see x equal x equal r see put term plus k value k maybe higher maybe excellent question know downward facing new graph negative tell us stick negative got graph like might higher lower got sure action happening two everything symmetrical basically want value k peak happening mean graph value basically put x equal want tobe let plug equation see happen x equal negative plus k tell k minus k plus sorry tell k better know n common sense picture picture reveal much formula got picture use brain use common sense sort nut way question everything fall place much rather student demonstrate intelligent thinking rather plugging formula guess opinion right thanks much discriminant quadratic dont need discriminant quadratic dont need discriminant quadratic dont need
