hi welcome math antic far series geometry learned point angle sin lesson going learn another important element geometry going learn probably already know lot polygon see time common example might recognize polygon polygon mean shape multiple basic definition polygon really understand polygon polygon need learn specific polygon common first need know three part make polygon sand part sides vertices sides straight line segment make polygon vertices point sides intersect angle formed intersect ing line sin fact word polygon literally mean polygon sides vertices polygon sides vertices form next thing need know polygon closed shape snow mean shape closed ask well mean sides connected area inside shape separate area outside shape way get inside outside without crossing line might help think closed shape like cage put ant inside cage way get without crossing line shape open way example closed example open shape sand important thing remember polygon must last thing need know polygon dimensional flat shape sand mean vertices must lie plane one vertices move forwards backwards n plane vertices would n flat shape also cal led planar point plane even though polygon ca n use polygon make box example box polygon flat sides specific definition polygon polygon shape sides vertices angle sa polygon closed shape polygon dimensional flat shape know time play polygon polygon host thank thank alright rule game gon na show shape tell shape tell polygon polygon ready play first shape square square polygon yes square sides vertices closed polygon next exactly sure call polygon nope close open shape ca n one polygon polygon yep polygon even though sides length closed shape fact count see one circle polygon well closed shape many sides problem circle n straight sides vertices angle sit curved shape polygon next star shape like polygon straight sides vertices closed shape mean polygon one right polygon dog ah h interesting one closed shape straight sides vertices also curved part still polygon curve curved part polygon polygon straight sides polygon guy polygon well straight two cross cross ca n polygon plus big open end guy definitely polygon last one right polygon shape made polygon whole shape polygon well time week join us next week decide bigger one game really good idea polygon last thing want mention polygon special depending many sides list important polygon cal led triangle triangle important geometry get whole video polygon cal led quadrilateral swow fancy math word help remember first part quad mean quadrilateral like square rectangle also get video polygon cal led polygon cal led hexagon sand polygon cal led way polygon however many sides like cal led regular polygon angle equal irregular polygon angle equal course lot polygon probably wo n need know long know polygon identify ready move exercise section pretty easy excuse good luck thanks watching math antic see ya next time learn math antic polygon math antic polygon math antic polygon
