right going build video certain animated approach thinking superimportant idea math fou rier transform anyone unfamiliar goal video introduction topic even already familiar still think theres something fun enriching seeing component actually look like central example start gon na classic one sound also really wan na show glimpse idea extend well beyond sound frequency many seemingly disparate math even physics really crazy ubiquitous idea let dive sound right pure per second meaning measure air pressure right next headphone speaker function time would oscillate around usual equilibrium wave making oscillation second note like structure per second think resulting pressure v time graph look like well point time pressure difference gon na sum would individually let face kind complicated thing think point peak match resulting really high pressure point tend cancel get pressure v time graph pure sine wave something complicated add wave get complicated right combination four pure complicated given low amount information put microphone recording sound pick air pressure many different point time final sum central question gon na take signal like decompose pure make pretty interesting right signal really mix es together back akin unmix ing multiple paint colors stir red together general strategy gon na build mathematical machine treat signal given frequency differently treat signal start consider simply taking pure signal say lowly three per second plot easily let limit looking finite portion graph case portion zero second second key idea gon na take graph sort wrap around circle concretely mean imagine little rotating vector point time length equal height graph time high point graph correspond greater origin low point end closer origin right drawing way moving forward two second time correspond single rotation around circle little vector drawing wound graph rotating half cycle per second important two different play theres frequency signal goes three times per second separately theres frequency wrapping graph around circle moment half rotation per second adjust second frequency however want maybe want wrap around faster maybe go wrap around choice winding frequency wound graph look like diagram come pretty complicated although pretty important keep mind thats happening wrapping signal around circle vertical drawing top way way keep track distance original graph correspond full rotation around circle spaced second would mean take second make one full revolution point might sort vague sense something special happen winding frequency match es frequency signal three per second high point graph happen right side circle low point happen left precisely take advantage attempt build machine well imagine graph kind mass like metal wire little dot going represent center mass wire change frequency graph wind differently center mass kind wobble around bit winding peak valley spaced around circle way center mass stays pretty close origin winding frequency frequency signal case three cycle per second peak right valley left center mass unusually far right capture let draw kind plot keep track center mass winding frequency course center mass two dimensional thing require two fully keep track moment let keep track x frequency everything right x relatively high increase winding frequency graph around circle x center mass goes closer kind wobble around bit three per second theres spike everything right right central construct let sum far original intensity v time graph wound version two dimensional plane third thing plot winding frequency influence center mass graph way let look back really low near big spike around new frequency plot correspond fact whole cosine wave chosen signal oscillate around dipping negative value play around various winding frequence plot winding v center mass would spike value three negative value little bit weird messy think especially first example let continue thinking term graph want understand spike around correspond shift main focus far frequency decomposition concerned bump three whole plot ill call almost fou rier transform original signal theres couple small distinction actual fou rier transform ill get couple minute already might able see machine let us pick frequency signal play around little bit take different pure signal let say lower frequency two per second thing wind around circle imagine different potential winding keep track center mass graph plot x center mass adjust winding frequency like get spike winding frequency signal frequency case equal two cycle per second real key point thing make machine delightful enable us take signal consist ing multiple pick imagine taking two signal loo ked wave three per second wave two per second add like said ear lier get longer nice pure cosine wave something little complicated imagine throwing winding frequency machine certainly case wrap thing around look lot complicated chaos chaos chaos chaos woo p thing seem line really nicely two cycle per second continue chaos chaos chaos chaos chaos chaos woo p thing nicely align three cycle per second like said wound graph look kind busy complicated relatively simple idea wrapping graph around circle complicated graph pretty quick winding frequency whats going two different spike take two signal apply transform individually add result get first added signal applied attentive among might wan na pause ponder convince said actually true pretty good test verify clear exactly measured inside winding machine property make thing really useful us transform pure frequency close everywhere except spike around frequency add together two pure transform graph little peak went little mathematical machine exactly wan ted pull original jumble sum unmix ing mixed bucket paint full math describe operation let get quick glimpse one context thing useful sound edit ing let say recording got annoying high pitch youd like filter well first signal coming function various time different voltage given speaker one millisecond next want think term take fou rier transform signal annoying high pitch going show spike high frequency filtering smush ing spike youd looking fou rier transform sound thats like recording without high frequency luckily theres notion inverse fou rier transform tell signal would produced fou rier transform ill talking inverse much fully next video long story short apply ing fou rier transform fou rier transform give back something close original function kind little bit lie direction truth reason lie still yet tell actual fou rier transform since little complex idea first back wound graph looking center mass x really half story right mean thing two dimension got well typical math whenever dealing something two dimensional elegant think complex plane center mass gon na complex number real imaginary part reason talking term complex rather saying two complex lend really nice description thing winding rotation example formula famously tell us take e number times gon na land point get walk number around circle radius counterclockwise starting right imagine wan ted describe rotating rate one cycle per second one thing could take expression amount time passe since circle radius describe full length circumference little bit dizzy ing look maybe wan na describe different frequency something lower reasonable would multiply time exponent frequency f example f one tenth vector make one full turn every ten second since time increase way ten full exponent look like another video giving intuition behavior ex imaginary input curious right gon na take given telling might ask well give us really nice way write idea winding graph single tight little formula first convention context fou rier transform think rotating clockwise direction let go ahead throw negative sign exponent take function de scribing signal intensity v time like pure cosine wave call g multiply exponential expression times g mean rotating complex number getting scaled according value function think little rotating vector length drawing wound graph think awesome really small expression super elegant way encapsulate whole idea winding graph around circle variable frequency f remember thing want wound graph track center mass think formula going capture well approximate least might sample whole bunch times original signal see point end wound graph take average add together complex divide number point youve become accurate sample point closer together limit rather looking sum whole bunch point divided number point take integral function divided size time interval looking idea complex valued function might seem weird anyone shaky calculus maybe even underlying meaning really doesnt require calculus knowledge whole expression center mass wound graph great built kind complicated let face surprisingly small expression whole winding machine idea tal ked one final distinction point actual fou rier transform namely dont divide time interval fou rier transform integral part mean instead looking center mass would scale amount portion original graph three second would multiply center mass three six second would multiply center mass six physically effect certain frequency persist long time magnitude fou rier transform frequency scaled example looking right pure frequency two per second wind around graph two cycle per second center mass stays spot right tracing shape longer signal persist value fou rier transform frequency though even increase bit fact longer time interval giving wound graph chance balance around circle lot different moving part let step back summarize far fou rier transform intensity v time function like g new function doesnt time input instead take frequency calling winding frequency term notation way common convention call new function ghat little circumflex top output function complex number point plane correspond strength given frequency original signal plot graph ing fou rier transform real component output could also graph imaginary component separately wan ted fuller description inside formula built context imagine seeing formula would seem sort daunting understand exponential correspond rotation multiplying function g mean drawing wound version graph integral complex valued function term idea see whole thing rich intuitive meaning way one quick small note call wrapped even though practice thing like sound edit ing finite time interval theory fou rier transform often phrase integral concretely mean consider expression possible finite time interval ask limit time interval grow man oh man much say much dont wan na call done transform extend math well beyond idea extract ing signal next video put gon na go couple
