welcome video vector earth call vector scalar well first let introduce vector vector quantity magnitude direction saved magnitude magnitude mean size something vector quantity know magnitude size know direction moving towards let stalk scalar scalar quantity magnitude know size scalar quantity know direction scalar quantity magnitude show real life example sand think make lot sense first say going road road trip travel distance direction travel given us know travel north south right left direction given us thing thats given us distance magnitude far traveled therefore distance scalar quantity magnitude direction unknown let say example direction given us let say right call displacement displacement another way saying distance displacement direction object moving must given know direction displacement vector quantity displacement magnitude example displacement also direction example right hope give better idea displacement vector quantity distance scalar quantity want go many possible think best way would listing common scalar common vector first example already established distance scalar quantity displacement vector quantity let list another common scalar quantity speed say car traveling speed per hour know magnitude fast car going know direction car going know magnitude dont know direction speed scalar quantity let say example car traveling per hour north example know magnitude fast going know direction going north call velocity velocity vector quantity magnitude direction common scalar time temperature magnitude direction common acceleration force change temperature magnitude also direction highly encourage think think magnitude also direction figure whether unit vector scalar
