subtitle contribute watching video probably mean know nature crawling theyre flower head pineapple pine cones like ever hear really nice accessible explanation theyre well past three week trying come explanation like mathematical core make happen think found let know went end video theres quite bit nice math going talk video particular theres nice connection golden ratio check part ill focus flower head like let close look jump course theres going way going way theres focus middle even theres course move want emphasize different visible indifferent part flower head smaller visible theres always region overlap consecutive see different region theyre always next two plant like grow sequence starting two seed grow like plant exhibit spiral something common grow central point theres bud pu shed middle appear middle push everything boundary give really nice homogeneous flower head case bit detailed look weve got first guy sitting sitting waiting second one second one squeeze like third one squeeze theres bit asymmetry goes top well theres gap thats next one going squeeze theres gap next one going squeeze also see seed bud growing theyre pu shed nice pattern quickly robust lead basically every seed bud role inside flower head consequence plant growing bud pu shed radially actually move along pretty much straight another thing focus part flower head take basically always see thing even kind turn around like always see thing close look see everything pac ked thing squeeze middle everything get kind pu shed thing densely absolutely optimal dense st circle like thing like bud would really pattern dont quite get get fairly close youve got theyre inter leaving like also get align ing certain ways youve got another one going way let see sort comes real plant pretty much take part plant able fit pattern closer look two theres first one thats family spaced going around center flower head theres second one going way comes naturally little stable pattern established center flower everything pac ked closely um get two spiral happening focus plant actually see another family spiral doesnt jump like two actually jump extend part plant close look first two spiral make diamond cell third type spiral form diagonal cutting diamond call diagonal three spiral connected like actually translate mathematical core appear flower head like well family spiral way equally spaced like another one way equally look diagonal family like count number spiral always find number green plus number red exactly equal number blue one sand already see connection right theres two theyre added third number like way sequence actually going prove end video proof p roud brilliant proof part video short contain sorry let run weve got one number visible thats green weve got another number visible thats red dont blue yet blue one come next number sequence visually well let look ill highlight one green spiral si highlight one red spiral ill also draw one blue jump ing yet focus point magnify spiral correspond shor test connection mean spiral making basically looking neighboring bud extrapolate connection see neighboring bud indicate green moment happen everything get pu shed let go see mean weve got arrangement way throughout everything kind get spread along ring also see length ratio change fact one become longe st connection one sare shorter take away close second open actually longer see green see clearly blue red thats goes well see next type spiral appear ing middle become dominant push thing weve like different kind already kind start two know add third number two visible one becomes visible next two add one visible moment going visible next starting two seed get like sequence happening point thats definitely part explanation doesnt quite explain yet well start seed like could pop first theyre established everything else determined rule well theres bit confession make mean often come plant thats actually true theres actually lot different sequence come also like double example also guy theyre cal led come quite quite bit common follow rule two always add next one well theres still bit predominance sequence explain well really close look individual plant detailed analysis well link couple description lot complicated goes beyond going explain give one bit insight know sort sequence come nothing else think plant really also start small right start since pattern talking established quickly also quickly see like ring two apparent going small spiral sin spiral right going either one guy going take know quite plausible alright quite happy explanation tell whether happy apart still want give proof green plus red equal start two equally spaced spiral actually made drawing program another one kind twirl way overlap like draw family diagonal spiral whenever something like doesnt matter comes always get green plus red equal blue proof circumnavigate ring start corner first follow one red spiral cant go switch one green spiral follow one awhile switch red one green one red one green one doesnt really matter exactly doesnt long make closed path like yellow path point intersection yellow path highlight first make green green corner corner put red go switch green keep going like way around alright actually see glance green plus red equal blue go every red point exactly one red spiral mean theres exactly many red spiral red point sand way theres exactly many green point green spiral hand theres exactly many blue spiral sand show delighted giggle glance green plus red blue thats video um eventually well also make part watch one thats going connection um contribute orris
