hi welcome math antic today gon na talk important math concept cal led order operation order operation set math rule tell math operation like addition multiplication first might wondering especially need rule tell operation first order well really good question answer going give two totally different people math problem solve problem like addition better multiplication gon na first give us multiply get easy better copy answer u h gon na copy answer want right answer prefer multiplying going first add give final answer make think right answer calculation correct even checked calculator calculator need right correct answer boo p boo p boo p boo p one guy think right neither one made mistake calculation operation different order got different answer since mistake way right math would subject different answer problem order operation help us order operation rule way us agree order math operation always operation order always get answer know need order operation rule find rule basically four go something like first operation parentheses bracket next exponent multiplication division last addition subtraction take closer look one rule see example help us first list operation parentheses bracket case seen parentheses bracket used math let briefly explain work parentheses symbol curve forwards backwards used pair like put operator form group almost like parentheses form package hold whatever math stuff put inside bracket work exactly way parentheses different shape look little boxy mean exactly thing parentheses bracket used group thing together rule tell us operation inside group first example look problem operation multiplication addition addition symbol inside parentheses mean form group need part problem first part inside parentheses simplified value math inside parentheses get single number like usually need show parentheses parentheses gone one operation left multiply give us final answer parentheses really help know part problem supposed first get problem one set parentheses like fortunately matter set parentheses first need everything inside parentheses anything thats inside parentheses word need simplify parentheses group addition first group second group last operation add value got simplify ing know always operation parentheses bracket first take closer look second rule say next thing exponent seen exponent way writing repeated multiplication example repeated multiplication written shorter form twice written times written times idea small number cal led exponent power tell many times multiply bigger number together take care parentheses simplify ing exponent becomes next highest priority example problem simplify exponent multiplication exponent telling us multiply together twice times multiply result times oh one thing point sometimes get problem exponent inside parentheses like problem may wonder get rid parentheses might think simplify exponent first breaking rule truth whatever operation inside parentheses parentheses first parentheses really tell start problem first power mean part inside parentheses equal parentheses gone add get final answer alright gon na look last two rule together two rule really important deal common math operation addition subtraction multiplication division rule tell us need multiplication division addition subtraction see rule work let look quick example use basic operation first try one ah look familiar yep one gave two friend ear lier rule see multiplication addition add give us second guy right sarcastically surprise try one rule tell us multiplication higher list subtraction first give us subtract leaves final answer one division subtraction since division higher priority divided first equal subtract get final answer another problem rule say division addition divided equal add get one last problem multiplication division rule tell us well multiplication division tied priority importance addition subtraction reason need extra part end rule say left problem multiplication division supposed work left right case get different answer go right left example problem work right left wrong way would first get divided equal go left right would divided first times equal wow direction went made big difference whenever problem mixture multiplication division mixture addition subtraction know operation order left right alright done one look four rule start practic ing exercise order operation rule say first operation parentheses bracket next exponent multiplication division left right last addition subtraction left right alright video good luck exercise see ya next time learn
