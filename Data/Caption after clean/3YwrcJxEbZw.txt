understand real need understand number line positive right zero negative left zero hear various complicated definition real one number plotted number line cal led real look minus plotted number line point minus two real number zero point five even though integer plotted number line somewhere let look another number root two also cal led square root two calculate value root two get approximately decimal point end kind cal led nonterminating decimal number sand yes plotted number line plotting nonterminating number might sound weird yes possible root two also real number special number pi approximately equal also nonterminating decimal number yes plotted number line make real number thats definition number plotted number line cal led real number let talk bit different kind know first kind like number point go nonterminating recurring like six es dont end cal led recurring since number reoccur sand nonterminating since reoccur infinitely third type nonterminating nonrecurring saw example type root two approximately equal decimal end hence cal led nonterminating cal led nonrecurring since specific pattern reoccurrence broadly three type see nonterminating recurring nonterminating nonrecurring two together cal led rational number sand category cal led irrational two together form real definition real irrational together form real number sin second part video look real comprise
