hi welcome math antic video gon na learn arithmetic sometimes people use word arithmetic use mean thing word math working often used specifically refer four basic math operation addition subtraction multiplication division gon na use word video gon na spend rest video talking four important math mean math operation exactly math involve operation operation tell example addition operation tell us take two combine amount add amount end amount combine two subtraction operation tell us take one number away another number word start amount like subtract take away amount left subtraction take amount away another amount multiplication operation tell us take one number repeat certain number basically repeated addition example amount multiply mean combine group get total times repeated addition multiplication take amount number finally division operation tell us take number divide certain number equal example start amount divide mean want separate group case would group division take amount separates number equally sized think l l see similar repeated subtraction make arithmetic easier write operation get symbol even one symbol addition use symbol cal led plus sign show two added see math operation like say plus subtraction use symbol cal led minus sign show number another reading sign usually say minus take away multiplication use symbol look lot like x cal led times symbol problem would read times oh sometimes symbol like dot asterisk also used show multiplication finally division use symbol usually call division sign read like divided several type division sign commonly used one used long division fraction line also really useful way show division slash like video going focus four main symbol arithmetic operation plus minus times divided one really important symbol use time arithmetic n tell us instead tell us specifically tell us two amount equal cal led equal sign arithmetic equal sign used show answer operation set operation son one side equal sign show math operation need done side show answer get done speaking answer know answer four arithmetic operation get different name important learn l l help need read math instruction word answer addition problem cal led sum answer subtraction problem cal led difference answer multiplication problem cal led product answer division problem cal led quotient try memorize someone ask product l l know really answer get multiply speaking memorization minute l l see important memorize basic arithmetic problem first want tell two important thing arithmetic first thing need know two operation order n matter two operation matter addition switch order l l still get equal matter number comes first answer still multiplication switch order multiplication problem l l still get case answer switch order operation like still get answer technical math term say operation commute commutative property saying ten times fast commutative property commutative property commutative property commutative property commutative property commutative property commutative property commutative property commutative property community property hand subtraction division commutative property switch order problem l l get different answer mean pay close attention order subtraction division problem make sure working right problem example taking away taking away dividing group dividing thing important need know arithmetic operation form pair cal led inverse operation good way understand inverse operation think undo feature computer something computer usually way undo go back way math inverse operation like addition subtraction inverse operation one add get undo operation taking subtract ing get back original like give addition give subtraction multiplication division inverse multiply times mean combine group total could undo dividing could take divide back separate group multiplying group thing dividing alright v e learned lot arithmetic far comes actually arithmetic really helpful start basic arithmetic usually involve answer arithmetic problem made may thinking like lot fact memorize right fortunately two thing learned arithmetic bad inverse operation really memorize fact addition multiplication know easily figure subtraction division fact example addition memorize fact l l also know two different subtraction l l know minus l l also know minus group sometimes cal led fact family fact related fact family grand canyon fact family climbing mount fact family surface multiplication memorize fact l l also know two different division l l know divided divided another fact great need memorize addition multiplication fact still lot half many might think addition multiplication commutative switch order problem get answer mean know addition fact also know need memorize true multiplication know fact also know pretty handy huh lots times math fact organized tables help memorize especially true multiplication fact invention cal led times table table show answer get number along top row number along side row lot answer memorize remember rule switching order memorize half chart get answer lot information arithmetic might want watch video n get first time exercise section focus helping memorize basic addition multiplication practice sooner l l know basic arithmetic l l ready move arithmetic topic like order operation arithmetic always thanks watching math antic l l see ya next time learn
