welcome let talk synthetic division dividing one polynomial linear term often school curricula nice speedy method get quickly way thats completely devoid understanding remains completely mysterious usually memorize procedure real value end much better purpose stuff sake speed let go synthetic division process let talk polynomial division general show far powerful coming understanding rather get first need understand let simple example suppose wan ted take x squared plus minus multiply say plus keep fairly simple well basic sense multiplication really geometry problem area say area rectangle rectangle one side going x plus x minus long going inch es long explicit area negative divisor side thats long side thats guess area mall gon na little x squared negative dividing one three piece one negative two inch es long admit dream model little extended algebra imp lied model appropriate algebra gon na take six piece look get well piece x squared times get piece x squared times thats squared squared piece order like minus negative piece area product two polynomial must sum six piece nice feature laying way notice pair x lined diagonal see answer actually x cube plus x squared x minus theres area approach working product mighty dandy actually cal led gall e method want simple arithmetic base exponent base ten interested problem backwards use rectangle method method reverse take problem pretend dont know answer cube plus squared plus minus time want divide done rectangle method mean dont know answer goes reconstruct based answer one sides well one sides answer came diagonal term need rectangle one diagonal diagonal diagonal first diagonal cube next diagonal next angle negative answer division problem missing side rectangle work three piece well answer yes goes um gon na advise us complex root work turban thing q mismatch es start top left corner one term cell give diagonal cell must cube tell times cube choice must x squared well knowing thats x squared top piece must times x squared x squared great like little keep going logically deduce happen next well yes look x square far got three piece must squared something x x squared better x well set work cell times better oh wan ted two x diagonal must negative x whats tell piece negative fact stop theres answer x squared plus minus little soft check whats final piece negative times negative yes match es final diagonal perfect division problem theres remainder tell go done polynomial division answer x squared minus grand thats piece cake let another one let give time ill give answer part question squared plus plus divided x plus area problem basically given given one side side definitely x plus question going need two three diagonal one one x many column mean theres couple ways think try give diagonal yes stop another way think going x squared divided something x probably something single x need column column nothing x sand nothing fact two column sis right weve seen give right one diagonal x squared diagonal x file diagonal use project juice way table look side rectangle must well yes theres one cell give give diagonal top left corner must square times x squared talk x times two x force x wan ted seven x better something times got mean cell together perfectly know squared plus divided x plus way thats synthetic division synthetic division way codify ing appear table without actually drawing table writing x however synthetic division codify ing method works linear term prefer writing dont mind spending extra actually writing x executor forth power really complicated division problem synthetic division taught school would useless example something look sa horrendous x minus x plus thats must make minus sorry minus x plus plus x squared minus x plus reason thats unbeknownst anyone world buy x squared minus gon na coming rectangle synthetic division set deal quadratic met fail however know denominator telling want rectangle coming one side length thats three piece x squared negative many column need need one two three four five six seven diagonal pick way x sixth thats going divided x square happy much dealing x fourth gon na need one x need x squared need x need x fourth hopefully give three diagonal first diagonal sixth right think gon na bother writing keep looking enumerator x possibly come one cell top left cell sometimes support x squared support x sixth see four x fourth guy negative eight x fifth force sky four x fourth look negative six x fifth come second diagonal must x fifth right x fifth something times x squared fifth must x right therefore let move complete rest column negative x fourth must x cube right let look next diagonal need negative x negative x still need negative x thats diagonal mean must negative x squared forcing x cube forcing negative x squared next diagonal x cube right wive got x better negative x cube must minus x minus x times x square negative x cube actually x squared actually negative x next diagonal x x square better x squared let see better mean note better negative better done check know check father die ignore negative x yes penultimate one final one yes everything hanging polynomial division see answer fourth x cube minus x squared minus x plus thats synthetic division understanding powerful synthetic division
