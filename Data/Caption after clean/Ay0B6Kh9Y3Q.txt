ked simplify square root let step first thing say well thats thing times p top part simplified bottom part rewrite bottom part right square root exact thing third one half power thing square root thing third power given thing numerator say well thing times p third times p third power let see simplify even going equal denominator first power principal root well squared positive root p third thing p times p cube root n anything easy well actually could think way could say squared view nine way best way think could write kind making unsimplified help us calculate actually thing squared power right times third course times p going equal squared power times p p instead writing p let write negative even let try write like denominator thing negative right want thing thing p denominator thing p negative p negative whole expression far simplified right let copy paste work next line let copy paste bring right see simplify even let think see write essentially take something cube cube root something taking something power taking cube root find maybe could factor thing cube root thing dont divisible times times times fourth power three times could rewrite could rewrite times times well write like times thing let think p sand step would piece paper really want understand kind going p times p negative going times p minus power p times right thing thing could times times times thing times times times done multiple times times minus work actually three halves number let say negative minus equal negative use common denominator use common denominator minus six equal minus negative value equal negative times p negative power times times last times times cube root right three cube root could say right cube root cube root get times cube root times p negative sometimes might want write p herein front radical tend simpler way actually let write p negative p negative write radical times cube root times could say multiplying divide two simplified far go could view could say negative times cube root wan ted could calculate cube root multiply times give decimal number times p negative simplified thing get fractional exponent expression exponent expression equation algebra khan academy fractional exponent expression exponent expression equation algebra khan academy fractional exponent expression exponent expression equation algebra khan academy
