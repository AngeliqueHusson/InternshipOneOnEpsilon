hey whats everyone welcome back math name lesson going help gainsome practice develop working really tricky geometry proof ahead check hey whats geometry student thank thank thank joining lesson going help geometry proof know theyre making crazy let go ahead work three different example better wrap head around strategize complete thing case proof always diagram given information something prove apply ing already know geometry given information diagram construct alogical argument statement reason table example want prove triangle congruent triangle word show purple triangle size pink triangle show congruent one given line g j line h k bisect f reason course given visualize know g j k h two bisect point f bisect two equal halves conclude segment g f congruent j f also congruent h fand reason saying definition bisect next notice pair vertical angle say angle congruent reason saying congruent know congruent point look diagram ask enough information prove triangle congruent triangle answer question yes triangle two congruent sides congruent angle use side angle side postulate prove triangle congruent triangle proof totally done bet bet feel little bit better right first one let go one welcome everyone geometry proof level proof structure ever going diagram two given information particular proof prove congruent first two triangle want prove triangle congruent triangle see two triangle combined make alar ger right triangle image mind let use strategy last example start first given mid point segment u visualize segment u point r know segment half conclude congruent reason saying definition mid point thats cant really draw information first given since example let go ahead check first one move onto second one say segment v congruent segment u v u v length congruent given used apply already know geometry keep mind prove pink triangle light green triangle congruent notice triangle share side v r whatever length v r pink triangle length light green triangle conclude v r congruent v r reason saying reflexive property clear diagram prove triangle r v congruent triangle postulate three pair corresponding congruent sides done proof one let give shot k proof going little bit structure diagram given information case unlike last two example sin one prove two line segment congruent two triangle going extra step case want prove congruent segment de well label ae blue de green let go ahead use first given angle angle second given tell us angle angle congruent well label diagram well given used let go ahead figure information diagram notice triangle b ce two congruent angle two three given know isosceles base angle theorem go ahead add table also know since triangle b ce know sides opposite congruent angle also congruent conclude b e congruent ce e definition isosceles triangle may sure information going end helping prove congruent de however always label much take thing table need information figure easier proof going also notice two smaller triangle b ea pair vertical angle angle know congruent theyre vertical vertical angle congruent helpful piece information see two consecutive congruent angle congruent side one conclude triangle bae triangle c de congruent since two ae de wan ted congruent beginning part triangle showing congruent finish proof statement say e congruent de corresponding part congruent two yellow triangle congruent sho wed second last step proof could conclude corresponding part also congruent well thats guy done thank much joining hopefully like dour colorful creative presentation please stop soon good one alright everyone lesson thank stopping sure click link subscribe add new every week really awesome stuff coming dont want miss also subscribe list link description send newsletter every cool stuff mash map really cool content free run gram twitter everywhere guy dont miss check us subscribe list good go catch guy next time see ya
