let look interesting problem based formula studied probability fair dice thrown probability getting sum trust really interesting dice simultaneously probability getting sum call dice show number need think hard give us sum well get another combination give us get possibility get sum mean probability getting sum written probability getting getting get long expression two talking first event get second one get use since either doesnt matter get sum case let event let event b essentially need find probability b formula write p plus p b minus p intersection b let ask interesting question think two event happen together thats impossible get six get six five event b mutually exclusive probability intersection b zero chance occur together let zoom bit since zero formula becomes p plus p b need find two p five notice b considered two event two looking event say two event independent outcome one affect probability p written probability getting probability getting similarly p b also written give us simplify ing fraction write probability getting sum throw two dice quick er way solve two dice
