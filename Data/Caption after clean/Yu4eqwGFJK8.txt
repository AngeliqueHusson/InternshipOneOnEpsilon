construct regular hexagon inscribe inside circle going first draw diameter circle actually going go beyond diameter going draw line goes center circle keep going going make flat goes directly one right goes directly center going construct circle thats exact dimension circle thats already drawn let put one right let make dimension sand going going move new circle center old circle circle notice center intersect old circle new circle center old circle reason interesting already know distance distance two equal radius also know straight edge also know distance right equal radius equal radius new circle right also know distance right equal radius old circle radius radius two two point radius two point radius equilateral triangle essentially six going hexagon circle let well go radius new circle radius old circle could go thats radius old circle another equilateral triangle radius radius radius another equilateral got four times let go see let make sure well actually going hard let add another circle put center right want move little bit right want make oh thats close enough let see look pretty close thats size let move want center circle right like ready draw equilateral triangle sand really dont even draw inside see six vertices hexagon think satisfied could break six equilateral let would base one equilateral triangle sand actually let move let move one way move one right really care hexagon move right know length even change length connect one right let add another straight edge connect two point sand would done would regular hexagon inscribe din circle
