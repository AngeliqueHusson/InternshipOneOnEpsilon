solve plus less negative less equal compound inequality two condition z satisfy z satisfy let solve know z satisfy either let look look one plus less isolate z left hand let subtract sides get rid left hand side left hand side going minus cancel less minus less divide sides inequality dont swap inequality dividing positive number get z less less one look one negative less equal isolate z could divide sides inequality negative remember divide multiply sides inequality negative number swap inequality could write negative going divide negative going divide negative going swap inequality less equal become greater equal guy cancel negative divided negative z greater equal negative negative remember constraint constraint constraint right boil one boil solution set z less z greater equal negative let make clear let rewrite z could less z greater equal negative satisfy either one kind interesting plot theres number line right say right negative negative let think z less would put circle around since everything less let think z greater equal negative would mean include negative everything let different color mean include negative want oh mean include negative different color orange z greater equal negative include negative everything greater everything greater see weve essentially shaded entire number line every number meet either one going meet number going meet constraint number going meet constraint could try bunch plus less times less meet put meet one times negative less meet constraint wont meet constraint times plus less equal meet one meet constraint even works really entire number line satisfy either one constraint
