straight edge except marked straight edge straight edge ruler compass use draw edge following two point plane previously somehow given youthen put straight edge connect fine straight line way imagine straight line infinitely long paper infinitely big ca n line twenty centimeter well sort good question hum given line one centimeter know god line twenty centimeter draw one long line line one c given use compass measure pick starting point infinitely long line put c twenty times three times one central question people interested long time exactly length construct given line segment one centimeter one inch one unit today start learning mathematics even two year old three year old always start people time opposite thought geometry basis everything thought point triangle fundamental object sand thought something arise geometry question naturally ask little bit different first show thing possible give line segment length ask construct perpendicular bisector meaning line perpendicular line segment cut two equal piece open compass quite wide drew long line segment draw one circle arc two circle arc important part width radius circle width compass left right take straight edge connect two point arc intersect intersect compass wide enough half line perpendicular bisector wo n show maybe wo n show proof show connect point shape well red radius circle length kept compass width whole time shape cal led rhombus one rhombus two diagonal perpendicular cut half another thing angle n know big ca n measure n angle measuring device whatever bisector meaning construct line right middle take compass open whatever width n matter draw circle arc circle arc intersect two draw another two circle arc two radius two intersect draw line line bisect angle let show one last trick possible suppose given unit square tell every side length ask whether double square meaning construct square twice area go well want square twice area area square one one get area square multiplying side area one twice area area mean know x squared know x square root construct square double size comes construct segment length square root kind question start look like kind line segment length quite kind question square twice big comes question kind question line segment length root line long yes draw line want line perpendicular pretty much anywhere one way know construct perpendicular pick two point n matter construct perpendicular bisector little line segment perpendicular line forget happen take compass given unit segment key know know happen put mark guess next yeah hypotenuse exactly hypotenuse use theorem c c squared equal plus c squared equal c equal root finish job well would make square side length let make bit longer want perpendicular perpendicular know perpendicular draw circle arc draw another circle arc k believe side well yes three sides square measure side put length measure side measure side square well done job done yeah double square question try triple square u h u h similar involve little bit extra trickery fun problem think first thing sho wed u h bisect segment instead bisect segment could ask trisect segment cut segment three equal part opposed two equal part answer still yes actually pretty wo n like perpendicular properly cause believe construct short cut way open compass length want put another line start point line segment angle n matter whatsoever put compass end measure whatever length n matter one time two times three times side line segment trisected line connect two end sand point draw parallel red n thaught draw parallel parallel perpendicular perpendicular would would draw perpendicular red line would construct perpendicular point hum would parallel another one magic intersect trisect origin next thing next natural question sho wed bisect angle trisect angle give angle dont know measure cause n measuring device come construction would result two divide angle three equal part based everything sho wed far would said yes well could n two thousand year people thought problem tell answer let give another problem told triple square one kind generalization problem doubling square hum going ratio want multiply could also try going dimension square thing instead doubling square ask doubling cube mean well given unit cube need cube whose sides length want try figure construct another cube twice volume volume unit cube one one get volume cube multiplying side length side length side length cube times times doubled volume new one would n know side length figure side length know volume times times get get cube root equal cube root cube root cube root compass straight edge well know could n people thought two thousand year problem could n crack could n crack people curious many many smart people early eighteen hundred came along ingenious guy cal led die age nineteen duel essentially revolutionize algebra nineteen nineteen yeah waw theory theory came math program university thaught year say fourth year undergraduate first year graduate hope also teach duel gave people tool eventually problem sand well solve proven eighteen impossible guy proved cal led pier see much harder something solvable need come solution solution still tricky hard solve something impossible thats prove something impossible hard ca n know saying thought ten year could n proof maybe smart enough come something explicit prove absolutely impossible came kind question ie kind length construct given unit segment example show square sho wed sho wed turns involve fraction square root addition problem cube root guy proved never able cube root sand also used crack problem trisect ing angle somehow comes cube root trigonometry cube root problem cube root big problem question arise prove ca n cube root prove ca n cube root good question use translate geometry main question answer analytic geometry probably high school always start unit segment somehow unit segment always given begin want construct stuff translate everything question start unit segment construct system unit segment length point construct starting cube root like island get exactly question think instead point exactly construct ask point construct basic step told basic step like drawing line two point drawing circle news point pour intersection intersection circle sand might remember high school solve intersect ing thing comes equation sand equation come equation equation circle u h also might remember high school calculus ever took calculus equation line linear equation equation circle quadratic equation solve never going get cube root big problem big problem big problem
