last video learned find like call easiest common denominator personally prefer use method getting common denominator whenever quick easy remember think least two would better use different method convert unlike fraction like first case one fraction bottom multiple fraction bottom number second case teacher say use method new method cal led finding least common denominator involve common denominator find instead product bottom like first method find least common denominator two need figure least common multiple two bottom case forgotten multiple number result multiplying another whole number like gon na find least common denominator short first take two different bottom start making multiple start times times times times help arrange multiple small table almost like scoreboard keep thing organized easy find stop making multiple soon find answer answer cal led least common multiple become new common denominator know least common denominator figure whole fraction need multiply unlike fraction get equivalent fraction common denominator solution use common multiple example get common multiple first unlike fraction use whole fraction get common multiple second unlike fraction use whole fraction lost yet make lot sense seen start problem plus one take two bottom make multiple see find common multiple first let multiply easy multiply give us still see anything common let multiply times times look something common column found least common multiple happen make sense remember multiplication tables know gon na use common denominator whole fraction need get answer multiple chart get common multiple multiply gon na use whole fraction first fraction common multiple could use whole fraction really need since multiplying change anything already denominator side se need change tokay multiply times give us bottom times give us like like fraction use simple procedure add add top keep bottom number one example let find fraction let start making list multiple two bottom look common times times times times times times times ah ha found least common multiple use common denominator let figure whole fraction need use make fraction denominator use first unlike fraction since times use second unlike fraction times multiply get two new equivalent fraction common denominator add simple procedure top keep bottom number use least common denominator method really hard get han g forget exercise video way really learn math good luck see next time learn
