hi welcome math antic sin lesson going learn important concept geometry cal led perimeter perimeter fancy math term mean distance length around shape exactly distance around shape mean well distance length quantity measure like centimeter inch es mean perimeter also quantity measure length example perimeter shape would n could c mor instead could really important talking exactly mean around shape seem like would lot different ways go around shape would short would long well perimeter mean absolute shor test distance possible around shape would distance get trace path exactly around border edge good way see perimeter imagine could walk right along edge shape like polygon imagine starting one polygon vertices walking along side got way back point star ted total distance traveled would perimeter shape case length side polygon total length would travel along sides would add good way see perimeter imagine could take shape like square break one could unfold shape formed straight line length line perimeter shape help understand perimeter quantity even though like square distance go around know perimeter measure calculate different geometric shape swell depend perimeter curve like circle hearts thing like fact l l wait talk perimeter circle another video video going focus find perimeter polygon made straight sides easy find perimeter know length side add total length end perimeter polygon let try example see works first polygon l l try triangle triangle three sides different length find perimeter triangle add length three forget remember also put easy let try another one time polygon rectangle see shorter sides long longer sides let add add sides order want long forget sides accidentally count twice think l l add two short sides l l add two longer add two answer l l get total perimeter rectangle thought going forget n time ah another good example regular polygon regular polygon mean sides exactly length good diagram show length one side since polygon regular know sides must also c long could add sides like since use multiplication multiplication really repeated multiply number sides length sides x mean total perimeter must centimeter better formula works regular polygon matter many sides sides length multiply number sides side length let try one example polygon also six sides regular polygon sides different length one really tricky show us length four sides two missing figure like come time math problem quite given information kind problem key use know figure know mean look closely two vertical sides know length inch es imagine two vertical sides could move straight across side side know length see missing length would combination two vertical length know inch es since missing vertical side must inch es long notice thing horizontal sides know imagine moving side know see length must equal combination two inch es plus inch es equal v e used length know figure length n know know length sides add get last sum sides inch es perimeter shape end lesson v e learned perimeter distance length around geometric shape v e learned calculate polygon add length sides total length perimeter oh forget forget get good math take practice thanks watching math antic l l see ya next time learn
