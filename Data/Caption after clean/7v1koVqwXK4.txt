right video going example finding equation hyperbola kind two sort standard form actually write little generically ill point example going find equation hyperbola know bottom left write equation hyperbola little generically saying x minus h squared squared minus minus k squared b squared hand k going point virtu going point equidistant vertices look like vertices one two three look like one vertices one negative like asymptote crossing point h k going equal fill point remember going distance asymptote cross one vertices case value going positive simply moving four right get vert ice eight four last thing going use remember asymptote positive negative type open left right use positive negative b ax know value case already figured four need figure v value well notice asymptote goes point go tome look like slope least asymptote positive slope look like line slope positive slope positive asymptote going x well rewrite asymptote equal x could get denominator multiply top bottom would get well x asymptote since know pop ped value positive well numerator must b value say b value going equal got everything need fill equation hyperbola say x squared squared minus minus b squared equal could always multiply say equation would x squared minus squared equal finding equation hyperbola given graph example finding equation hyperbola given graph example finding equation hyperbola given graph example
