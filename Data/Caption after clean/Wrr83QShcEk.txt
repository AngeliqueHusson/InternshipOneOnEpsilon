g day jam es would buy front yard beautiful lovely evening better sit enjoy bath mathematics ill sit chair table grand time tonight except problem table rough ground nicely stable chair wobbly dont like sitting got problem whats different table chair might notice table three chair four turns key difference fact matter put ground oh dont always stable kind curious obviously chair need way whats going well fact three leg good always put two leg ground rough ground tilt table third leg stable position matter choose table fact camera right filling tripod tripod deliberately three footed know rough ground always find stable position tripod fact olden days want milk cow got treadle milking stool stool back always three legged rough barn floor stool always stable position matter wan ted put object clearly fall could problem chair problem see theres lovely way solve problem let right got got definitely two stable leg fact always find two stable leg case opposite corner good leg ill cool good leg gon na keep hold good right pair leg bad hovering ground theyre hovering ground could actually make touch ground could send push chair make good leg go good ground instead actually rock right cant actually push ground tell could make pair leg want good like maybe pushing chair right good diagonal pair perfectly surface rough ground bad pair take chair journey going move around bring back spot make sure switched leg good leg still holding hand ground theyre good pair surface right switched theyre theres level earth thats surface position however good leg meant tobe good push chair least theoretically make good pair good pair ground think said position bad pair ground rotate nice smooth continuous way brought position pair ground smooth continuous transformation ground ground must nice intermediate spot actually bad pair ground positive number negative number must passe zero good pair ground right bad pair bad pair theres intermediate position degree oh like one ground zero zero ground bad pair mean stable weve shown rough four legged object like degree find position four leg stable beautiful ball little bit got actually made discontinuous surface actually argument region work nice smooth continuous service k cal led intermediate value theorem want anything nice smooth continuous ground like extremely bumpy like spike good despite go chair caveat swith actually mathematician shave study problem square object like rectangular tables found nice position ground thats stable long ground wild keep continuous dont make spiky good set stable chair thing put anyway set lovely thinking mathematics right thanks much
