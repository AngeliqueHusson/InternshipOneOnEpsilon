hey fresh shell walker green ring annulus area two concentric circle line segment tangent inner circle length eight area ring video going present five different ways solve problem even get correct answer might want keep watching end video give brief introduction visual calculus figure give problem try ready keep watching video solution well first adjust diagram several rotate figure tangent line horizontal next well draw inner circle radius length b vertically radius make right angle line tangent tangent line half tangent line length draw one halves four finally draw outer circle radius length c hypotenuse right triangle first way solve problem make convenient problem multiple choice test deduce single numerical answer depend dimension b c pick convenient value b c need right triangle one life equal four might well use three four five right triangle b equal c equal five solve problem calculate area outer circle pi times c squared since c equal five equal calculate area inner circle pi times b squared since b equal equal pi finally area green ring difference area outer circle area inner circle subtract two get answer pi correct answer could mark exam move theres answer depend dimension b c next method ill present also give idea true first let show answer doesnt depend circle length tangent segment proceed similarly going use right triangle squared plus b squared equal c squared mean squared equal c squared minus b squared like previous method calculate area outer circle pi times c squared calculate area inner circle pi times b squared area green ring difference area outer circle area inner circle pi times c squared minus pi times b know c squared minus b squared equal squared theorem therefore answer depend quantity equal answer pi weve proven generally length always pi times theres miller special case allow solve problem take limiting case well let inner circle radius equal shrink inner circle tangent chord become radius outer circle show mean demonstration graph ing calculator calculator could check provided link video description graphical version problem equation shaded green ring tangent chord whose dimension set equal equal four tangent length radius inner circle star ted calculated area two circle calculus formula pi times squared theyre equal adjust variable let imagine shrinking inner circle radius well obviously outer circle radius adjust dynamically see shrinking well inner circle radius goes way get outer circle radius equal thats exactly equal tangent chord length see tangent curve becomes radius outer circle calculate area see area two change change radius inner circle dependent length equal calculated area annulus equal pi times equal pi thats approximately point shown decimal interactive follow decimal interactive also play around length tangent chord see tangent chord increase going change area two circle tangent gourd decrease also going change see calculation give exactly numerical answer particular value tangent going see area green ring unchanged depend son look value parameter interesting interactive check give understanding whats another way solve problem let return diagram use textbook geometry chord theorem chord outer circle well extend horizontal line outer circle well extend vertical line chord outer circle well extend vertical line radius outer circle difference radius outer circle inner circle c minus b let remove thing dont need outer circle two outer second segment vertical chord equal c plus b two chord outer circle intersect dividing chord product two one chord equal product chord two segment horizontal chord divided four four vertical chord divided two segment c plus b c minus b multiply chord set equal tobe equal c squared minus b squared thats information return original diagram know area ring equal area outer circle minus area inner circle pi times quantity c squared minus b calculated c squared minus b squared equal therefore get area ring equal piso one way could solve problem doesnt require theorem actually get based core theorem let one way could solve problem method known visual calculus many theorem cal tech student devise new approach solve area annual led anew proof theorem imagine rotating triangle area tangent line particular look area side weeps exactly area annulus consider discrete version process consider area tangent degree interval area swept approximately degree approximate give idea whats going one way calculus area going group tangent going rearrange common center point separate tangent going rearrange theyre common center point end anew shape exactly area shape well reminiscent familiar geometrical shape something length radius going circle radius technically circle limiting shape tangent cluster tangent wave taking infinitesimally small even ten could get idea tangent cluster would circle radius exactly equal side length tangent sweep area tangent cluster rear ranging new shape could imagine special case instead sweeping annulus actually length sweeping around center point shape would make well would make circle exactly therefore calculate tangent sweep annulus instead trying calculate could calculate term tangent cluster well know area circle equal pi times therefore thats also area annulus sort thought process generalized formalize mannequin theorem area tangent sweep equal area tangent cluster regardless shape original curve tangent furthermore weve done weve come new proof theorem imagine someone comes new proof result known year result theorem well calculated area annulus equal pi times squared also know area annulus difference circle pi times quantity c squared minus b squared set two formula area annual equal cancel pi rearrange get c squared exactly equal plus b squared new proof thousand year old theorem thats answer problem figure way problem enjoy thanks watching video please subscribe channel make video math game theory catch heron mind decision follow face book go ogle
