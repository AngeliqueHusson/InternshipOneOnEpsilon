following selected video teacher browse complete math example video interactive self test try complete lesson today central angle area regular hexagon radius let start problem drawing picture regular hexagon radius note hexagon six sides radius segment join center hexagon vertex also make sure large hexagon order leave room information well figure later problem find central angle remember central angle regular polygon formed two radii drawn two consecutive vertices formula measure central angle divided number sides therefore since regular hexagon sides measure central angle divided six give central angle diagram measure remember pith om polygon perpendicular segment join center two aside let use variable notice pith om two congruent know bisect central angle two angle therefore degree triangle work shown green let give short leg triangle length x remember degree triangle hypotenuse times short leg equal times x x replace x diagram remember degree triangle long leg root three times short leg represent pith om seven root three next find perimeter notice part one sides length seven since two right triangle sare congruent part side must also length seven length full side plus since six congruent sides regular hexagon formula perimeter hexagon times length side case times finally find area hexagon remember formula area regular polygon times perimeter case times root times would first multiply one half times times root root area regular hexagon radius
