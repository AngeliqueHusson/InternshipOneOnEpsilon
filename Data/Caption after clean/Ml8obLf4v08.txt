alright video gon na example formula gon na find area triangle given little p little q length point angle q degree touse formula need find length missing side plug everything business figure missing side well think actually use law couple times least work us first figure know touse law given angle q side opposite opposite length given side length opposite angle p first thing going figure angle p use help us figure angle r well use figure side length well finally position actually use right soso let see could say sine p thats gon na equal sine degree twenty one point six gon na multiply sides well p gon na sine times twenty one see sign getting sign degree roughly point seven eight eight well multiply eighteen twenty one point six seven eight eight x divided twenty one point six getting tobe roughly point six five seven rounding inverse sine sides well get p inverse sine point six let see inverse sine point six five seven getting tobe roughly forty one point zero think gon na round degree goback triangle know angle p degree well add together right plus degree whatever angle r add weve got get hundred eighty degree since theyre inside triangle thats going plus angle r always subtract subtract believe left degree really angle degree definitely scale gon na use law figure side length right maybe well call little r side length little rover sine seven degree equal doesnt matter use think ill use degree could multiply sides sine well get r equal twenty one point six times sine degree degree let see think said somewhere sign calculate sine degree said sine degree thats whats gon na go denominator point seven eight eight weve also got calculate sine dont know dont think sine getting point nine nine nine rounding let see well twenty one point six times nine going change much divided getting equal twenty seven point three eight guess getting little bit closer think ill round twenty seven point three eight gon na round twenty seven point four weve got side links finally use formula actually simply find area touse formula first find semiperimeter twenty seven point four plus plus twenty one point six two think definitely stuff end day plug calculator twenty seven point four plus plus twenty one point six hey thats exactly top sixty seven divided two gon na believe thirty three point five use formula whoops getting say take subtract away different links let see one links twenty seven point would take point five subtract away would take thirty three point five subtract away length twenty one point six squeeze bunch arithmetic nothing worse thirty three point five let see take thirty three point five subtract twenty seven point four get six point one thirty three point five minus eighteen thats going give us fifteen point five thirty three point five subtract away twenty one point six thats gon na give us eleven point nine let see together thirty three point five thirty three point five times six times fifteen point five times eleven point nine getting pretty big number underneath three seven six nine two point three five seven five going square root area roughly equal one ninety four point one five square inch es dim going round one hundred ninety four square inch es
