welcome second special right triangle video one going go triangle like triangle reason triangle special length longer side proportional length shorter sides let take look example wrote left let say length shorter sides equal x notice sides equal x isosceles triangle side thats opposite angle going tobe exact length say sides length x shorter sides length triangle know length longer side hypotenuse could say length side opposite angle going length square root two true use information solve triangle quite easily get star ted right away example alright example angle degree angle degree obviously last angle degree easier example give length one shorter sides let say length one shorter equal sides opposite angle going length shorter sides isosceles triangle one length shorter side know length short side also going length side opposite angle also going like said hypotenuse always side opposite angle know length shorter sides equal two like said shorter sides going equal x know x equal two know length hypotenuse longer side equal value square root two need multiply value x square root two going multiply x square root two whatever left side right side x times square root two equal two times square root two know length longer side hypotenuse solve three sides triangle like said easier example go little bit difficult one right example going little bit harder going give length longer side instead length shorter side let say length hypotenuse equal right like said hypotenuse equal x square root two x square root two equal hypotenuse know length two equal length two n know value x yet know value square root two try solve equation get x going get rid square root two going divide sides square root two left hand side square root two cancel thing left x right hand side two divided square root two ca n leave final answer radical denominator need rationalize know going multiply bottom top square root two going continue bottom since n really much top two times square root two ca n simplified rewrite times square root two bottom square root square root simplified even notice two cancel x equal square root know value x square root x equal length shorter sides know length shorter sides equal square root completely solve three sides triangle hope gave better idea solve also video triangle check hope see next one triangle triangle triangle
