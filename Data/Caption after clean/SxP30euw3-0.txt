jam es think going really exciting video today going generate radioactive find quite un nerving stuff dangerous really respect hurt let ked generate random number right want throw straight back want play game actually want everybody right watching everybody want clear head moment want think random number ha ran choose number speaker tell oki choose speaker ha ran choose number speaker speaker speaker likely chosen learning quickly male speaker picked going said ha ran choose tell number say going choose random going choose even number n sound particularly random either going go middle hell random probably want prime number like trying n worked hard enough get left left everybody choose something innately random number course ridiculous nothing random number said pick random number said know random ask came clearly thats random number property make number random n sequence individual number n number random entirely depend context right theres nothing random random yes random part sequence least random human mind make seen little game random scientist model part modeling gas es need give random kick get star ted n identical gas every time ca n go give molecule random value use computer choose random number sand spectacularly bad chance getting computer generate completely random sequence random generate sequence look feel random us random look closely enough always going find easiest way go write let write ha ran typically way computer engineer going go generating sequence random think number call number first number sequence zero th number sequence going multiply number something big something random going call rather unimpressively atypically going something order thousand sat point theres absolutely nothing random whatsoever going take another big prime number thousand going add spectacular lack imagination going call b still random know random next step probably complicated biti going take number got modulus normally define percent sign mand cyclic division essentially remainder divide example use cyclic division divided get use divided going get remainder ha ran make big number process number jam es ha ran must still get every still get number absolutely every time answer going need sign get next number sequence going take going feed back going use generate going feed back generate get sequence feel like might random start x always going get identical sequence going write piece soft ware random sequence need value different every time kick computer need different state start obvious way way simply use time use number merely second since going feed different important thing cyclic division going eventually repeat depending choose b n repeat sooner rather later going get cyclic pattern sin random number snow n call random call pseudo random kind random really random better though right ked generate random number let goback game start going say let generate random number time really obvious way brought die throw generate random number probability coming always true want generate number let get another die first ca n generate two dice recognize going number throw get many many ways throw throw one way throw got throw double want throw got throw double throw load ways far likely let draw one die probability two dice going get probability quite sharply peaked brought dice throw three throwing random right brad ha ran well done almost going throw three dice find get similar plot curve like go starting produce thing cal led normal distribution cal led normal almost everything nature probability distribution based dice based probability behavior lots thing identically get distribution absolutely everywhere distribution shape bit like sharply peaked likely get average value still completely random ca n tell value going tell probability value n want hear ancient thrown two thrown three brought frankly every die going throw many dice throw many go floor end distribution probability number going get distribution people think random number actually uniform deviate basically mean every number sequence got chance coming doesnt make random make random choose number sequence n matter probability choice may likely choose number middle n mean randomly possible choose number ha ran like result random probably going thats random misunderstand going win one ked give random number really want gone way gone safe something going create random number got small radioactive source going randomly give neutron turns proton comes electron strontium coming counter getting steady stream electron sand counting number count surprise surprise completely random let turn let show show happy sound radiation hear see individual one flashing electron going counter pretty cool written small computer hope works number going get deviation mean value know mean value count going giving difference value number actually count go laughing well expect ing little dramatic mean got exactly mean value likely outcome yet somehow didnt expect going try generating another random number honest really want prime much random want spectacularly random number ha ran video got good news actually starting new channel bit like computer sit something lot ked channel going properly may star ted go look subscribe put link screen underneath video video description sort thing look hope see random random random
