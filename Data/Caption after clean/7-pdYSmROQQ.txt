music hello hello name rober duke math cal led gay math studio beautiful space filled holding hand synonymous life reaching trying hold hand walk crazy landscape cal led mathematics hope partnership help hope learning lot happy create today going talking remainder factor theorem almost obvious get goal gon na walk process help see see like oh oh sometimes student say like oh blah blah blah love student use word like meaning really get let get place let first break polynomial alright quadratic x squared gon na make point factor guy x x multiply negative five add four multiply negative add positive multiply negative one needs negative one positive sure negative five add positive positive five one going solve quadratic solve polynomial set basically parabola hit x axis zero hit solution one x equal negative right question would way us use division solution ill give brief example suppose gave number like said hey know based give factor gon na give something divide factor number multiply make gave factor like pose question factor well seeking factor would would get factor said factor hopefully instinctively thinking divide big guy would get big guy divided said factor must divide evenly happen exactly right exactly situation polynomial x squared plus said x minus factor multiply make x squared plus minus x plus factor multiply squared plus minus question given one factor would get factor play around supposing n know factor later clips going know x squared plus said hey check give factor one factor x minus cool x minus would get factor pretend ing didnt see right like like method really see mountaintop get give let us know really climb let pursue hypothetical one factor fine different going divide factor polynomial going synthetic division division basically goes like put solution factor box set x minus solution like plus one sides x equal one goes box put front order trying keep keep track x like x squared minus five would one zero negative five zero cal led would place x x time x squared minus five put one four negative five divide evenly question x minus one divided evenly hopefully believe answer yes x minus factor x minus factor factor would divide evenly divide something evenly term would remainder know something evenly hopefully know remainder would zero comes one drop drop like times one one put add four plus one five five add zero remainder course remainder zero something evenly remain ing factor right divide result nine remain ing factor divide x minus x squared plus get remain ing factor herein coefficient remainder constant single x term maybe another x squared term would ascend would go get x positive five kind cool one thing talk following let take f f mean evaluate function x x would mean x plug let see know evaluate f anything simply plugging plug x student would plug x plus use little color take actually need let keep alive take whole choreography n plugging x get f equal squared plus equal minus f notice x function becomes x look closely lead us amazing conclusion k could calculate f simply plugging orf f plugging x could calculate f anything synthetic division observing remainder synthetically divide get look f right herein remainder cal led synthetic substitution solve f anything division observing remainder let example let solution one negative five let like something fun like seven seven cool let solve f ways f plugging x synthetic substitution observing remainder seeing get thing go yeah leave use help us old school way f bam go f equal f oh got trouble go let roll minus plus see afraid make mistake home boy girl plus yeah oh wish another way solve f oh cal led synthetic substitution rock roll simply divide synthetically solution case x solution x value x goes box box negative timber lake fan multiply get times boom fear multiplication going work substitution k let stick times hundred plus wrong something seven let see mystery forty nine plus twenty eight synthetic substitution miss anything one well add ad found found got ta add knew see something wrong thats love math theres fooling fa king work multiple angle always like say mountaintop kind cool go challenge mistake hope like whats going result know clearly going tobe screaming add need add multiply alright synthetic division take probably awesome get f equal synthetic substitution cal led hope made sense hope see remainder synthetic division solution f like remainder zero actually synthetically divide one factor evenly something remainder therefore notice remainder actually solution dividing anything result hope made sense hope divide number get f f anything want observe remainder able solve answer thank guy watching g map studio b whole dance felt luck algebra remainder factor theorem algebra remainder factor theorem algebra remainder factor theorem
