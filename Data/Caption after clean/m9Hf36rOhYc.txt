welcome remember high school days teacher riding back prince ton formula memorize though basically expanding term form x se squared think people know x squared plus cross term plus squared also memorize back day former plus cube turns cube plus squared plus plus cube also x plus fourth memorize thing really know x plus cube plus squared squared x cube plus fourth gon na keep going direction go backwards x plus one thats actually x plus go back plus zero th one theres something curious look appear first term second row maybe call one throw obviously soc one two really one times x times second row one times x squared third row fourth row write coefficient little triangular tableau obtain sequence array people recognize binomial theorem basically say take little binomial suppose thats binomial sum know high school term sare thats mile race nth power basically get whole sequence term correspond nth row triangle ah actually kind interesting loo ked video formula triangle know formula actually could actually write formula actually twice sentence pretty strange right let explain expanding binomial connection past guess trying first thats often mystery people actually difficult kind alright let clear scene r get rid drink stuff go away let go something really grimy look x plus fifth power binomial theorem say basically going fifth row triangle remember calling zero th row top right let really tedious x plus times x plus times x plus times x plus times x plus right need choose one term centered parentheses multiply together add possible combination ask get x fifth term answer yeah sure come choosing x choosing x choosing x choosing x choosing x fact thats way get x fifth one x fifth term ask x fourth times term well answer yes could get choosing x x x x thats fine actually get ways well ill go x x x multiplication commutative term could also rise going x x x x choose x choose x choose x choose lot one choose x get choosing x x x x x x x x x x x x see thats five ways actually pair x lo behold look thats second entry fifth row ah let keep going many ways get x cube squared thing getting little bit tedious question really many ways could arrange three x two draw upon take way ten minute explain everything one video go video zero factorial equal one answer number letter made factorial factorial divided number x three factorial father number wise two factorial number actually must go front squared term actually work five times four times three times two times one top line divided times two times one divided two times one turn ten next thing need us formula video video learn end different color pen thro triangle work thro place left right entry position example let count let look triangle video number fifth said count number place left theres something weird going always zero turns left hand press es right zero one two three place sin right indeed entry little mismatch denominator mob vacation actually fine number raising three x indeed next entry row triangle theyre actually indeed ten ways x cube squared sort work x squared cube many ways arrange five letter x three well thats next row come place going x fourth thats going factorial factorial either next entry fifth row another plus yes indeed fifth row triangle matching expanding x plus fifth power let fun people forget algebra x actually gon na fun choose right let whoops need pen x equal equal whats telling guy would plus fifth power thats fifth would equal go formula fifth x fifth plus times fourth thats times thats plus cube squared thats times squared q thats plus times times fourth thats plus fourth fourth thats dont way sorry ah thats fifth row triangle add fifth power bet theres nothing special fifth row weve basically proven binomial row triangle add power number right choosing x equal let discover thing swell put x equal well thats going tell x plus fifth thats plus negative goes x fifth would fifth one five times x fourth times fourth times negative thats minus times squared make squared positive positive plus plus minus alternating sum row triangle sure lot people notice geometry prove binomial theorem well one freak people need room return messy screen time sorry look ever take number square get hundred number month power cube work happen think check ing look like triangle well binomial theorem clear let look fourth one x plus fourth according binomial theorem fourth power fourth row triangle x fourth plus four execute plus six x squared squared plus four x cube plus fourth choose x equal equal fun might one saying x plus would fourth would goes fourth power right thats plus number x cube dis thousand times thats plus six times hundred times plus times plus one clearly one four six four one yes fourth triangle appear binomial theorem right one push little bit suggest little optional homework look fifth sixth result still working sense sense still work window theorem fine fact true ultimate homework start choosing x put x equal equal negative thats telling mysterious property triangle youve never thought put x equal discover talking hidden theres lots fun go right thanks much
