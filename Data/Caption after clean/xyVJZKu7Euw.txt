hello r lot student struggling graph ing linear equation si want example today make sure next time issue linear equation simple straight line snow simple algebra watching video let take look equation common form use cal led slope intercept slope intercept form slope intercept form every time equation alone probably going slope intercept parenthesis equation parenthesis need get rid try graph really like graph ing form alone looking b constant number variable intercept number immediately front x slope slope rise also equation attached slope going today sub minus sub x sub minus x sub slope rise run axis movement subtract find rise run value like teach graph ing teach slope reading book slope positive going going positive slope negative absolute requirement reading left right think make little bit easier think reading slope left right leave doubt run always right going graph ing slope negative going going slope positive going bottom number going hold consistent direction right teaching method graph ing found easiest couple example already set solve yor term blue one equal negative x plus slope negative n see fraction going write lot student nervous slope need rise run value need write slope fraction even look like problem slope negative also note know came first place nothing written front x variable matter always want know negative x negative x show slope right intercept b something else think slope intercept form without help always want intercept first slope second line going cross axis mark point negative front x going go repetition trying make sure line stays relatively straight going slope line good equation already maybe equal minus close completely isolated want divide everything get equal x negative divided negative running space going erase rest slope front x always front x slope x slope positive see nothing front like plus sign mean going intercept going plot first always last number constant number front x slope intercept first slope graph line looking equation unless variable already one time crossing value negative slope positive point origin intercept going go three two make new point viola system system system equation would point two cross thought would throw one line equation x value side negative minus equal negative negative alright going without least little bit scratch work equation almost standard would good graph x intercept minute want first another example slope intercept form mean value variable needs going bring addition get negative equal minus algebra please note negative plus four getting negative x term like show term together right hand side equation actually put together divide everything negative get equal x plus may note negative divided everything negative negative bottom denominator fraction written top matter put negative sign put anywhere want long one negative sign find slope front x slope negative going go intercept always constant usually end equation b intercept want intercept slope second going busy graph era sing second think put one line axis line slope rise run mean four bottom always right line line look like almost slope example graph slope intercept form ha minute talk graph line equation x variable like graph equation x equal like even enough question math kind think easy little going equation often x equal four x sure look like graph ing think couple point x four like x another point x like x four coming point x maybe forget x equal number vertical line maybe forgot x equal number line vertical line slope undefined slope zero undefined zero value actually slope number exist rise run value zero divide zero slope undefined want graph line equal think let use graph think couple value like right make value x make value make sure second number comma see forgotten equal number horizontal forgotten horizontal slope zero come couple point point connect dot get right answer graph ing slope intercept form slope intercept make sure intercept first reminder vertical equal number undefined slope horizontal slope zero go bing boom graph ing slope intercept form next lesson x homework graph ing slope intercept form graph ing slope intercept form graph ing slope intercept form
