hi welcome math antic sin video gon na learn subtraction similar addition like learned last video important main difference subtraction order problem matter swith addition switch order l l still get subtraction problem minus l l get switch problem around get answer try minus instead fact l l probably get confused l l trying subtract bigger number smaller one subtraction important remember order matter especially writing problem often given problem like l l rewrite like addition make sure first number one taking goes number taking away bottom another hint bigger number always topo kay let go ahead try problem v e got top place lined like draw line answer go write minus sign left show start getting answer like addition always start place column subtract bottom number goes place answer move next place column left found difference let see another example subtraction get little tricky let rewrite problem top place lined neatly answer line subtraction symbol start look place column digit top smaller digit bottom subtract bigger digit smaller one make kind wrote problem bigger number top sometimes top digit might smaller bottom digit subtract borrow borrowing top digit digit want take away sorry well neighbor bigger number loaded borrow excuse v e got little happen something could borrow course go great help add youd get fortunately came next number place really represent add get big enough instead column v e got first digit answer move next column remember bor rowed number place used went bor rowed well really bor rowed next number place sometimes easier think borrowing getting stick front digit borrow place minus give us zero answer last column minus nothing minus zero still v e calculated difference let try another example borrowing call let subtract start subtract ing place column since small subtract l l need borrow always borrow number place left l l borrow really l l write front borrowing digit case give us forget make digit bor rowed smaller cross write new smaller number like subtract first column place since bor rowed column become top number small l l borrow borrow next number place mean digit change put front borrowing digit make subtraction column last column easy bring leftover answer line nothing subtract mean answer know basic subtraction move practic ing exercise want show one important trick l l come across situation need borrow next number place digit happen zero borrow zero well l l borrow next two instead one case instead borrowing borrow l l get need borrow become needs borrow borrow borrow left two row like problem well needs borrow borrow whole next door become drop one become idea matter many row keep next digit left get number really borrow wrap lesson hopefully better idea subtraction works really get v e got practice sure watching l l see next time learn
