subtitle contribute orris watching video probably mean familiar infinite sum ever encounter infinite fraction many people infinite fraction incredibly powerful tool structure pattern hidden real number sand particularly good thing irrationality want use today chase irrational real get star ted let look identity save right part box box equal wherever see replace bit box example replace see another replace see forever seem say equal remind start guy turns replace two identity actually stays identity repeat game replace replace replace way infinity let look right sides actually identical mean course equal start exactly way last video unlike last time going tell wrong obviously something wrong supposed work comment instead talk infinite fraction end video able figure mistake number whatsoever representation infinite fraction continued fraction let show generate infinite fraction equal guy separate integer part rest number go rewrite one well quite something right evaluate one give give something remarkable coming exactly bad huh play game separate integer part rewrite guy evaluate keep going like forever give continued fraction representation guy special kind infinite fraction simple continued fraction make simple fact numerator n minus es plus es let try couple superhero es among real example golden ratio play important role got sort infinite continued fraction got n get simpler close look actually less another square root get something periodic fact square root slightly square root like give rise periodic continued fraction infinite one maybe try let take something n anything square root let go superhero right look continued fraction guy pattern well pattern start around let pick look deceiving actually continue like compare continued fraction decimal right decimal expansion complete mess continued fraction beautiful beautiful periodic infinite whatever actually use continued fraction produce proof irrational well first look rational number rational number number written fraction take fraction unleash scheme continued fraction correspond number maybe bit surprise thing end sit n go forever actually going fraction start fraction produce continued fraction correspond continued fraction finite really really quite nice n check maybe one run scheme n turn thing decimal number keep running pretty much see glance thing terminate fraction shave terminate term continued fraction expansion know proof basically e square root actually irrational well continued fraction expansion continue forever whereas rational would terminate neat n point time going ask irrational number question may sound little bit idiotic first glance either number rational irrational nothing grey zone one number irrational another number explain grey zone let look identity actually check whether identity well roll thing bottom guy calculate keep going like find yes true friend mine took number produced continued fraction expansion infinite one give ask figure number star ted well figure number star ted ca n roll bottom bottom turns continued fraction another really amazing property actually make useful sort purpose chop thing plus es create sequence partial fraction first partial fraction guy second partial fraction one guy calculate sequence partial fraction always converge number friend star ted staring quick important interlude us write equal sign really sequence partial fraction case remember always pushing term ahead us eventually kind threw away three dot swell really pin exactly mean thing still equal point interlude first partial fraction second partial fraction third partial fraction well value guy rolling bottom guy keep going like well one guy fraction getting closer closer whatever number probably already giveaway continued fraction expansion simple one see good approximation let turn decimal go digit actually correspond decimal expansion see one ridiculously good fraction see left side actually incredibly famous within history strict sense best general turns partial fraction come continued fraction expansion number best rational approximation number sense obviously take denominator get closer closer whatever number interested point small denominator really get incredibly close would n expect one digit able get close like number get close really punching way weight fraction sand description say little bit precise mathematical actually get grey zone happening talking take two generate partial fraction best rational approximation compare well two number sis easy approximate easy approximate u h partial well let compare two guy example right order one bit mess one think irrational say people would say well irrational actually would wrong plot twist guy irrational number hard approximate guy fraction seen easy approximate one really really well fraction really drive home point got table partial fraction next right left side see right really incredible speed hand best approximation really struggling get close replace pretty much number always lot worse anything else reason lot worse really really close look actually hidden plain got kind scroll like closer jump towards real value evaluate partial fraction something like incredible jump towards real value evaluate partial fraction get small jump get small get small possible choose small possible n get smaller make irrational irrational right laugh well mathematician definitely care may also hear golden ratio present nature place fact whenever comes come lot phenomena go coming together nature actually continued fraction sand give taste going today another video show hi ding actually produce partial fraction go see away right example natural occurrence thing well look flower head like guy count spiral see one direction number direction another number people n know actually focus middle part flower head like actually see different flower head like actually grown something cal led divergence angle divergence angle flower head like many flower head coming nature actually talk follow video either next video video tha tokay point time actually ready puzzle figure tell us comment wrong right really looking forward today music infinite fraction irrational number infinite fraction irrational number infinite fraction irrational number
