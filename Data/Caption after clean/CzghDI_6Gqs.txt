welcome today talk divisibility number people know rule wo n explain rule important explain true therefore fun put twist make thing curious interesting right first well rule divisibility apparently take number like one water got three million two hundred eleven thousand three well meant test divisibility eleven apparently alternating sum go plus three minus plus one minus one plus minus plus workout minus plus plus minus clearly good hearty multiple apparently mean original number check believe times something like alright nothing eight hundred two thousand seven eighteen test model day plus minus plus minus plus minus plus worked got make make got negative state add correctly oh perfect model number million whatever mortal check small example two thousand eight sixteen plus two plus one minus six plus three minus negative negative certainly multiple mean original number lot right earth would work alternating sum got divisibility eleven well thereas comes fact work base number system based let look happen divide clearly dividing one goes zero times leaving one left remainder leaven goes zero times remainder multiple know funny way multiple one less multiple want call remainder negative hundred hundred one put must one turns thousand one less check thousand one ninety one times mean leaves remainder equivalent negative one made ten technically people say n think negative one one less multiple e van play game let think let think clever good let goback thousand mean n know kind bizarre times times would said equivalent leaving remainder negative thousand must thing negative negative times negative well neither times indeed negative really four times thing negative times n plus next power least remainder negative times negative see old many pattern minus mean dealing actual number let actually actual number like n know roof swith pen let think eight group plus one group thousand plus two group hundred plus ten plus three group one ask happen remainder upon division eleven well ten thousand remainder plus one saying yeah thousand please remainder negative one one hundred lee lee made negative one three least remainder plus one listener plus one basically upon division eleven could see number leaves eight eight group plus one one group negative one plus one six group negative one three group plus one see alternating sum appear ing remainder upon division eleven remainder mob mean zero remainder original number bottle eleven amazing proved bit example know hundred twenty three month stew well eleven technique say actually upon division eleven ordinary sum minus plus remainder plus actually seethe ordinary sum give actual remainder upon division theres one one danger though one danger notice always want final digit positive give number like making odd maybe minus plus minus method saying care whether divisible could minus sign effect occur actually little flippant without way start ordinary sum wonder actual remainder minus plus minus know remainder minus sign negative equipment right right let fun knowing alternating sum trick example one prove palindrome likely mortal half time mean first palindrome palindrome number grease fourth backwards six whoops six four two claim palindrome even number must see true right leaves question miss palindrome odd must let think one pointed said feature mortal get number board done believe done silly want proved early small claim reverse mortal going multiple e van challenge think reversing bob guarantee give another model fact ill make puzzle even curious let stake number know like well one gnostic think even digit number n even number right got two two let think claim flip individual pair flip pairwise digit sin mortal keep number see right fact lead challenge another way divisible clear screen let take something like need pen back mister listen bright bold red sorry suppose want test divisible suppose n feel like ordinary something wrong claim think two digit number like put zero front add see oh plus plus add believe case get claim sum pair way sum mob meant original number multiple another example let let pretty easy example think two digit plus multiple challenge prove alternative rule works let give hint think time thinking right thanks much divisibility divisibility divisibility
