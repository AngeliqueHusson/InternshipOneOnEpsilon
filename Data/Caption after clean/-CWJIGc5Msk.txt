video going working area problem finding area two curve end crossing problem going tobe find area bounded equal x squared equal minus x closed interval first recommendation would rough sketch going look like kind get idea table curve bottom curve thing weve got squared gon na standard upright parabola vertex origin something look like first quadrant closed interval interval dont worry anyplace else looking parabola going two let say would two theres minus x squared right closed interval zero guess maybe right mean imaginary boundary would right two curve one one looking going concerned point cross right put representative rectangle alright see right top curve bottom curve section top curve minus x squared bottom curve x squared curve right hereafter point cross representative rectangle right top curve section x squared bottom curve minus x squared k look like going set two going run first one whatever intersection point run second integral alright first thing need find intersection point point intersection found sending equal x squared going equal x squared right add x squared sides two equal two x squared divide sides x squared thats going give x equal plus minus one concerned positive theyre going intersect since closed interval intersection point go set two integral left right first integral top curve going tobe minus x squared minus bottom curve x squared x want add integral second section integral top curve x squared minus bottom curve binomial want make sure include parentheses minus x squared x alright integral work us separate integral curve cross let still going simplify ill minus x squared second one grading simplify ing one ill x squared minus right point going straight integration going integrate pretty simply go squared got make x divide ill third x third zero one integration going exact integration go two third x third minus two x time ill one two right straight arithmetic hit pause see hand come answer get go ahead quickly finish plugging one gon na two minus right plugging zero thats going zero minus zero thats gon na give us anything plus sign right plugging third times another two going two four plugging one give minus two right one minus zero getting common denominator give thats going minus negative positive another thats gon na give total like third give overall area two lot arithmetic end point video youve got two curve crossing going pay attention figure top bottom probably break every time able find area definitely thanks watching dont forget subscribe channel thanks
