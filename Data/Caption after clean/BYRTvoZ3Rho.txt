ked talk little bit new innovation voting system like tell voting system buzz word academic describe mean really verify whole flow information head think want vote way casting vote tabulation final tally verify every step way going way vote count way intended final result accurate representation everybody vote sand right many voting system certain amount verifiability lovely thing paper ballot sis see know wrote intended important property nice cast paper ballot trusting chain custody paper make sure count done right right talk self ie thing people like take photo ballot n yeah lot fun think may increase voter participation little fun like ballot booth thing worrisome though security point view know self ie casting ballot sell ballot one thing learned hard way many many n want enable people sell n leave voting booth kind proof n receipt saying vote way n copy ballot n anything prove worth know buck know guy bar want know buy vote maybe coerce yeah possibly know vote way wan ted hard question make fascinating research area turns thread needle bit care bit cryptography bit mathematics idea would get receipt vote receipt plain text encryption vote something ca n sell bar something interpretable somebody like number bar code number bar code something like represent get receipt new thing verifiable system sis receipts get posted web say brad brad receipt r r receipt forth everybody name receipts get posted nobody tell anybody else vote ca n sell vote based posting web anybody look look see yep got receipt right receipt encryption vote right key thing know vote pile know vote pile way think reason believe explain encryption vote actually everyone encryption look different though everybody encryption look different simple encryption deterministic way good point yeah everybody voting al ice n look bob n look couple one well verify tally somebody en crypted vote primarily al ice bob assertion election official made know convince anybody right like convince everybody right without showing everybody vote got pile en crypted vote announce result like know election official like convince everybody right result number ways quite large literature way pretty simple describe could use something cal led homomorphic encryption mean mean together end represent ing sum encryption one times encryption two give encryption three right end plain text multiply cipher text cool lots wonderful thing particular tally voting system example vote vote al ice might encryption one vote vote bob might encryption zero suppose al ice bob two ballot either one zero basically want add n see use homomorphic property multiply together end number represent sum sum number vote cast al ice right tally al ice sum thing bob number vote minus tally al ice course al ice half multiply together get cipher text cipher text sum cipher text de crypted publicly way everybody see proper see yes everybody could also multiplication check cipher text de crypt election official could de crypt nice way show proper right tally one part need everybody verify tally en crypted thing sand cool right one part part want fact need know cipher text really represent ing vote right go voting booth getting receipt want know receipt really represent vote vote al ice get receipt ca n de crypt cipher text fact n able de crypt could sell vote like could self ie right want know really say al ice voting little subtle maybe matchbox analogy bad way explain know got good match going trip take one match know got good match well could take box drawer say well maybe box good try randomly sampling match es light yeah one light one want take match n tried yet maybe last match say well n tried match box good therefore going trust one good put pocket take something like encryption say walk voting booth get encryption first representation choice say al ice get encryption want see really good encryption like seeing good match strike ask de crypted machine since first place test see properly unfortunately ca n use vote know well ca n post could sell vote post one spoiled ballot ca n use get taken tally taken even posted tally used anywheres like n vote testing voting machine many times like know two three times check different different thing see machine reliably say want vote say voting al ice test say voting bob test say voting al ice maybe n test one say go post web got confidence like match es encryption done properly n need done lot people right needs done enough know n trying cheat large scale two part getting encryption trust even computer getting tally verify even though input tally encryption sand wonderful idea evolve year many different part together mean voting system verifiable way want vote end process casting ballot posting tally announcement result verify outcome right future might kind voting system everybody vote still research bit development jurisdiction starting use practice see goes optimistic al ice put another al ice pick one put back together copy got six cool drawn four two vote feat homomorphic encryption vote feat homomorphic encryption vote feat homomorphic encryption
