si mon want take little bit departure looking specific ask question measure one thing came across study ing math notion measure mathematically measure going going show real number line yeah familiar right think real number line head question whats distance measure long ha ran get ha ran know number need add get k thats know number know answer basically ha ran k well imagine didnt know answer imagine first time youve ever tried measure distance would ha ran id make piece wood distance would take see many put k thats good thats like actually good brought reality thats going really bite going really bite thats cool thats like fact said basically said k well going look bit number line know length start going go drag measure another way could could say take number comfortable know distance take whats cal led naive thats naive naive way measuring hopefully going take rabbit hole point right reim going put little kind little bit choke wire around point agree ha ran happy happy length ha ran whats length well give length need start point end talking point point one point whats length ha ran point dont whats another way saying take use exactly logic used segment line going use logic point like trivial maybe even annoying getting making point length point length line ha ran length still ha ran thing removed took thats right idea weve got line segment made continuous set point remove havent change havent change part reason behind real number line property next number whats number ha ran yeah exactly even saying correctly way describe doesnt contain awesomeness whats going problem stuff havent proved naive notion measure thats thats problem making almost broke math going almost broke math
