welcome video binomial distribution really important know method probability possible mean easy example would coin five times flip coin two possible either going head going possible use binomial distribution solve probability many five coin head many tail talk little bit example remember method possible two let get away example example say student five question quiz question possible answer us probability student got exactly question correct important recognize theres two possible problem one student going get question correct outcome student going get question correct since theres two possible solve problem distribution everything know first line say student five question quiz total number guess es total number trial going letter n know total number trial equal question us probability student got exactly four question correct five total guess es going succeed four times going get four question correct number times succeed equal four know theres five total question quiz student got four correct mean must got one incorrect write number got incorrect failure n minus k total number n minus number right k five minus four equal one talk probability success could say probability student get question correct say problem question four possible answer one four answer correct answer student guess es theres one four chance got question correct probability success equal one four could say twenty five percent know probability success probability failure must equal know probability success equal probability failure say probability student got question wrong equal two plus give us total probability hundred percent everything need formula give formula going scroll little bit give little bit space formula binomial distribution look much worse really bear basically probability event x equal total number writing comb os probability equal total number combination probability success k exponent k total number success es probability failure n minus kin exponent n minus k total number failure plug everything formula trying find probability student got four probability student got four question correct equal total number going talk combination little bit later going leave blank probability success know probability success equal could say number k exponent know k equal ill put exponent probability failure know probability failure equal number failure exponent n minus know number equal going put exponent let go back first part formula talk total number find total number combination student get four question let say could get first question incorrect rest four get correct x mean correct could get second question incorrect rest correct could get third question incorrect rest correct forth fourth question incorrect last combination get first four correct last question let count different combination student get question correct parenthesis total number combination put number difficult problem much easier find total number formula n factorial divided number k factorial failure minus k factorial formula total number combination plugged everything formula n number factorial divided letter number set number factorial number factorial dont know factorial mean factorial mean times times times divided times times factorial plugged calculator would total number combination going back original problem finding probability student got exactly correct probability student got question correct equal x exponent one exponent plug calculator get answer rounded four decimal point six could say one point four six percent probability student got exactly four one point four six percent hope gave better idea binomial distribution find probability little bit difficult example make video stay tuned really hope enjoying see next one
