answer like tokay looking one twenty three forty seven thousand whole number belong left decimal twenty three decimal dealing place mean seven needs lie last number thousand place three place decimal mean si need zero four seven make sure seven remains three place decimal answer right negative tenth place one place decimal also notice negative value problem start negative result going end negative value need make sure one last digit going one place decimal decimal end negative result take care let move right next problem two fifth two ways two fifth decimal ladies gentle men first way works every single time divide denominator show five go two division show decimal right since n value two mean decimal two add need solve problem gon na go ahead bring decimal goes goes four times terminate answer going four tenth ladies give result fifth two fifth written decimal another way convert two fifth decimal take two fifth try see make five power mean power like first power power thousand forth know five easily ten multiplying times two following since multiply times get ill multiply numerator well end tenth well gentle men simply written four change fraction denominator power easily translate decimal notation two ways solve ladies gentle men two fifth decimal would four tenth remember zero front decimal choose zero front decimal answer right let look convert anion decimal long division going showing decimal know goes zero times know go ninety four times times right going subtract goes five times answer ladies gentle men hundredth result going answer way get x x power know times easily convert power multiplying times multiplying well times simply remember hundred place decimal go ahead write decimal right behind hundredth like two different method got problem ladies onto next problem problem see two learned thus far take hundredth start long division divisor dividend going add couple bring decimal know goes zero times zero times times times subtract ing goes thousand five times like mean innocent zero know result going thousandth thats answer right long division convert seven two hundred decimal also following take hundredth knowing convert easily knowing five get thousand multiply five well seven times five thirty five end thousandth written thousand need five three place answer right two different method got result done looking ladies gentle men gon na use long division solve problem four divisor going three right went ahead added couple case four goes three zero times four goes thirty seven times subtract bring two goes many times exactly times answer hundredth like decimal notation working problem different way go ahead convert decimal power easily become know give multiplying numerator also multiplying straight across hundred mean needs two place decimal decimal done ladies result done part number three ladies gentle men could definitely use long division solve problem show divisor going showing decimal n know need decimal goes goes however times bring seven times zero goes many times exactly times evenly therefore end find thousand answer problem number three ladies thinking well r wit way convert three eighth decimal without long division right definitely convert three eighth ten let check gon na start gon na end thousand get multiplying multiply numerator times result three hundred seventy five thousandth needs decimal end upwith three hundred answer two method order get result ten denominator ten one hundred thousand thousand matter use long division simply divide denominator give result every time alright let go ahead move problem number four one six alright converting six power ten one strategy touse convert one sixth decimal long division six divisor bring one show need gon na bring decimal know six goes one zero times six goes one times six six ill subtract bring four zero six goes forty six times bring four zero notice six goes forty six times ladies gentle men six gon na continue repeat alright gon na keep going forever result zero decimal six six ladies gent six time number series use cal led decimal bar like answer pro number let check next example next example alright two third long division ca n change power n become ten hundred thousand evenly let see many times goes two going ladies three going two zero times right gon na show decimal three goes twenty six times becomes zero goes times right look times still mean six going continue repeat happen write result decimal bar six six going answer problem number five like right problem number six right problem number six convert decimal long division gon na gon na show good measure bring decimal n go one go times subtract bring ill bring next zero zero times ill bring another zero alright every time bring need place number division symbol goes nine times nine times bring bring another zero zero times add another zero bring find goes happening ladies gentleman notice zero nine write answer write say result going one nine decimal zero nine see long division thats zero nine keep write answer like nine hundred p roud number six ladies next one prod umber seven pro number seven four ninth nine becoming power ten worry strategy
