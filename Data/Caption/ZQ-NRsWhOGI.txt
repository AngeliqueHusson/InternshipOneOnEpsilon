here is a quick three-step process onhow to factor any quadratic that'sactually factorable the first thing youhave to do when you're given somequadratic equation that you have tofactor is that if there's somethingcommon to all of the terms take it outfirst it's just gonna make your lifeeasier then you have to look at what'sleft if you're left with x squared plussomething X plus something and it's justa bear x squared then you can useproducts um and I'll show you how to dothat if you don't already know what itis but you may be left with something infront of the x squared like 2x squaredor negative 5x squared plus something Xplus something if that's the case you'regonna have to use a little bit morecomplicated of a method I'm gonna showyou how to use decomposition but you maybe familiar with another method somepeople use a box some people use a bunchof other tricks you can use to whateveryou want but I'm going to show you howto use decomposition because anyone cando it ok so let's follow the process anddo this for a few different things thefirst one that I want to do it for is xsquared minus 2x minus 15 is there acommon factor among all the terms now xsquared minus 2x minus 15 this one'smissing an X there's no 2 or anythinghere so there's nothing we can pull outof all of those there's nothing commonto all of themnow next are we do we have a bear xsquared yes we do it's just x squaredminus 2x minus 15 so here's how you dothat second step find two numbers thatmultiply to negative 15 and add tonegative 2 as soon as you find those twonumbers you can plug them right into this well let's figure out what thosenumbers are they've to multiply tonegative 15 and add to negative 2 wellwhat multiplies 250 to negative 15negative 1 and 15 multiply that but theyadd to positive 14 so that's no good butnegative 15 and 1 those add to negative14 that's no good it's been a give towhat about negative 5 and 3 thosemultiply to negative 15 and they add toa negative 2 look at that those are thetwo they multiplies if negative 15 andadd to negative 2 negative 5 and 3negative 5 and 3 it's actually that easyas soon as you find those two numberscool someone's done we got rid of our xsquared we've split it up into twoseparate terms we've factored it oklet's do this one start at the beginningis there a common factor among all theterms 3 & 2 & 5 nothing common amongthose is in a bear x squared yeah it'snot so we're gonna have to use thisthing called decomposition here's howyou do that the first thing you do isfind two numbers that multiply to thistimes this now this is the only way thatthis new search is different from theold search you have to do negative 5times 3 you want them to multiply tonegative 15 and add to negative 2 now Irigged this so that it would be the samething two numbers that multiply tonegative 15 and add to negative 2 areobviously negative 5 and 3 we alreadyfound it but because we have somethingin front of the x squared we have to dothis and a bit tougher of a way what wedo is we write that laughs that firstterm and that last term just as they arenegative 3 x squared minus 5 and werewrite themterm as these two here negative 2x asminus 5x plus 3x now see negative 5 plus3 is negative 2 but we've divided it upwe've decomposed it get it and then onceyou get their factor the first two termswhat's common to both of these well notmuch except for they both have an X init and when you pull X out of thatyou're left with 3x minus 5notice that this is each of these termsbut we took away one X from each of themthen you factor the second two what'scommon to these nothing so it's reallyjust a 1 if it's nothing and because weweren't able to pull anything out we'releft with 3x minus 5 now we have 3xminus 5 in both of these terms so we canpull that it and what are we left withwell when we pull 3x minus 5 out of thiswe're left with X and when we pull 3xminus 5 out of that we left of plus 1and that's the factored form of thatequation a little tougher because youhave to decompose that middle term thenfactor the first two and second twotermswant to do a couple more here is there acommon factor among all the terms whyyes there is there's a common five bothof these are divisible by five andthere's an X in both of themwe can pull out a 5 and an X from bothof these terms when we pull it 5x fromthis we're left with just a single Xwhen we pull 5x out of this we're leftwith just 2 we pulled out the X and wepulled it 5 from there 10 divided by 5gives us that - oh look we're alreadyfactored because there's no x squaredleft that was easyfinally let's do this one is there acommon factor among all the terms 1/2 xsquared minus 1/2 X plus 12 I don't knowwell let's see you know what I couldpull out a 1/2 here and when I pull ahalf out of 1/2 x squared I'm obviouslyleft with x squared when I pull out a1/2 from negative 1/2 X and left withnegative x and when I pull out a 1/2from positive 12 I'm left with positive24 now is a 1 like do I have a bear xsquared yes I do if we remove that 1/2which we already factored out we have xsquared minus X plus 24 that we have tofactor so it's just a bear x squared wecan use this product sum we need twonumbers that multiply to 24 and add tonegative 1 that's the number in front ofX well we got to start reaming off pairsof numbers that multiply to 24 1 and 24those don't add to negative 1 though sothat's noit let me cross there at that waynegative 1 a negative 24 those don'twork 2 and 12 multiply to 24 but don'tadd to negative 1 negative 2 andnegative 12those don't want those don't add tonegative 1 eitherwhat about 3 & 8 don't add to negative 1negative 3 and negative 8 yeahdon't add to negative 1 4 & 6 multiplyto 24 ah doesn't add to negative 1 wellnegative 4 and negative 6 that alsodoesn't multiply to negative 1 you knowwhat I've exhausted all the pairs ofnumbers that multiply to 24this can't be factored further and yougot to be on the lookout for thatbecause you know what sometimes you justcan't factor things but before you writea bold statement like can't be factoredfurther you should probably run throughall the possibilities like I did theseare all the pairs of numbers thatmultiply 24 and not a single pair addsto negative one that means you can'tfactor it further three-step processfollow it be able to factor anything youwant[Music]
