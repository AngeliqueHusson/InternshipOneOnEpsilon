and the last and the most interestingcondition for congruence of triangles iscalled the RHS condition the otherconditions we've seen so far have an Sor an e in their names but this one's abit different okays as we know stands for side but whatabout R and H R stands for right anglethis tells us that the condition willwork only for right triangles and whatdo we have opposite to the right angleyes the hypotenuse that's your RHScondition so this condition says thattwo right triangles are congruent if thehypotenuse and one side of a triangleare respectively equal to the hypotenuseand a side of another triangle rememberhypotenuse and any other side let'sunderstand this with figures suppose wehave one right triangle ABC with angleABC equal to 90 degrees the length ofthe hypotenuse is 5 units and that ofthe height is 3 units similarly if wehave a right triangle PQR right angledat vertex cube with the same hypotenuselength and side PQ equal to 3 then thetwo triangles will be congruent we don'teven need to know the length of theother side or any other angle for thatmatter we can be sure that these tworight triangles are congruent as thehypotenuse and one side of one triangleare equal to that of the other does ithave to be the height let's assume thatthe length of side B C and Q are areequal to 4 units each will the righttriangles still be congruent yes you canbe sure that the two right triangleswould still be congruent the conditionsays hypotenuse and any other sideyou
