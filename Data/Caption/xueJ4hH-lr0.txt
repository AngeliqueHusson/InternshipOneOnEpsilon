all right in this video I'm gonna doanother example of solving an absolutevalue equation again the basic idea isif you have the absolute value of aequals B so long as B is greater than orequal to zero we solve the two equationsa equals B and also a equals negative Bso to begin with here we've got theabsolute value of 4 over Z minus 3equals 6 so what I've done is I've justrewritten the equation without theabsolute value I've got to solve thatand then I rewrote the equation where Isimply replace the number on the right Imake it a negative ok so to solve theseso I guess let's look at the one on theleft side first probably what I would dohere to get started is simply to get ridof this Z minus 3 that's on the left youcan multiply both sides by that quantityZ minus 3 so on the left of the Z minus3s would cancel we would have 4 leftover I basically have 6 times Z minus 3on the right two different things we cando I usually just go ahead anddistribute you could divide by 6 but Idon't like to deal with fractions if Ican avoid itso we'll get 6z 6 times negative 3 isnegative 18 I'll add 18 to both sides sothat will give me 22 equals 6z and now Ican simply divide both sides by 6so divide by six divided by six one ofmy solutions if I reduce since they'reboth even I could use eleven thirds so Zequals eleven over three would be onesolution and then the other solution I'mgoing to do the same thing just multiplyboth sides by Z minus three so on theLeft Z minus 3s would cancel leaving mewith positive four then I would havenegative six times Z which is negativesix Z negative six times negative 3 ispositive 18 I can subtract 18 from bothsides 4 minus 18 is negative 14 equalsnegative 6 Z and I could simply againdivide both sides by negative 6 negative14 over negative 6 is going to bepositive 7 over 3 and now I've got mysecond solution
