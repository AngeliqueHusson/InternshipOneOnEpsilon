good evening stats fans it's time againfor Robert a dude with jameth orgmy name is stack Center presented by theMichelson 20mm foundation backwards yeahonly two episodes left in thisground-shaking earth-changing pioneeringseries tonight on our penultimateepisode we're making sense of plots thatare scattered abouteach year it seems the notion of buyingchampionships in professional sportsgrows all the more popular if there werea poster child for this throw money atthe problem tactic it will be the NewYork Yankees spending mountains of cashand achieving 27 World Series titles butwhat exactly is the relationship betweencha-ching payroll and the number of winsin a season does money actually buy winstake that or is it a myth it's a totalmyth Robert joining us for insight intoone of sports most timely questions is aman who has dedicated his career in thefront office to this very questionit's mr. Moneyball himself a man so sexyonly Brad Pitt could play himOakland Athletics executive vicepresident of baseball operations andminority owner Billy Beane Billywelcome to stat Center scottson sportsRobert one does not work without theother now Billy the money buying winsquestion is it fact or merely fictionwell I think you know where I stand inthis debate Robert and I think theconsistent winning record of our OaklandA'sdespite a relatively low payroll isreason enough to argue it's a myth butdon't take my word for it let's look atthe math here we have what's called ascatter plot pairing the winds of eachmajor league team to their payrolls onthe x axis below we have the payrollvariable representing what each teamspent that specific year on the y axisat the left here we have the windvariable representing the number ofgames each team won in that same yeareach point on this scatter plotrepresents one team with the graphrevealing how many games each team wonin relation to the amount of money it'sspent on its players with all the pointson the scatter plot we can get a generalidea of how the two variables interactok we'll come back to that idea in asecond but first Billy can you help ourlovely viewers at home learn how tointerpret scatter plotssorry Robert sometimes I forget I'm notin the front office talking with my guysin a scatter plot the main attributes tolook for our trend strength and shape sothe trend being the general direction ofthe graph exactly shown here areexamples of two scatter plots of varyingdirection the scatter plot on the leftis trending downwards showing a negativerelationship that is as the values onthe x axis increase the values on they-axis decrease the scatter plot on theright shows an increasing or positiverelationship what about strength aresome scatter plots just more muscularthan others oh yeah it was a bad jokeRobert but you're actually not that faroff it still hurtsthe strength of a scatter plot refers tohow tightly grouped the points arearound a certain trend the strongrelationship has points predictablyclose to that general trend while a weakrelationship has points that are spreadapart so going back to these twoexamples the scatter plot on the lefthas points that are high on the left andlow on the right and those points are abit spread out but they still seem toshow some common trend we might callthis a moderately strong negativerelationship with the scatter plot onthe right the points are going in apositive direction and they're veryclose to the linethey almost form a straight line bythemselves so we'd say they give us astrong positive relationship now whatabout shape the final characteristicwith shape we're mostly interested inwhether the appearance of the data islinear or non-linear a linearrelationship means that the points ofthis scatter plot approximates astraight line without any jumps orcurves a nonlinear relationship is justa relationship that simply doesn'tapproximate a straight line going backto our original question whether there'sa relationship between payroll and windswe could actually see whether or notthese two groups of data are linearlyassociated with each other okay itappears that the traindoes seem somewhat positive but is therea way to be more exact with ourconclusion well in that case we need toexamine the actual numeric data we useto plot there's a magical number thatrepresents how strong the relationshipmay or may not be within data we use itall the time in our Moneyballcalculations it's called the correlationcoefficient here's the formula what isthat thing is that Greek oh it is Greekand just an FYI even some of the beststatisticians in our franchise don'tknow it by heart so don't feel like youneed to an internet search for acorrelation coefficient calculator willlead you to where you want to go thecalculator will ask for every data pairso beginning with the first pair theDodgers at around 235 mill likes pairedwith 88 wins next the Yankees was 203mil and 84 winscontinuing down the list until everypair is entered Oakland if you'rewondering is sixth from last with thetotal payroll of a little over eightythree mil which is also paired with 88wins same number of wins as the Dodgerswas it worth all that moolah la timewill tell I assume the R in the formulais the correlation coefficient quiteastute a Duke yes and R will always be anumber between negative 1 and 1 thereason being that negative linearrelationships will have a negative Rvalue and positive linear relationshipshave a positive R value the closer to 0the correlation is the weaker of therelationship ok so let me get thisstraightfor example a correlation of negative0.2 would be a weak negativerelationship while the correlation ofnegative 0.8 will be a strong negativerelationship same would go with positivepoint 2 that would be a weak positiverelationship and point 8 would be astrong positive relationship is thatright might be asking you tocome and work for the yeas after thisinterview Robert resumes online yes andit turns out from the correlationcalculator that the r-value correlatingtotal payroll and total wins is pointtwo two so there you have it at leastfor this particular year we can concludethat there is barely a positiverelationship between payroll and overallwins that realization certainly pavesthe way for other factors that influencewinning besides payroll like theimportance of coaching or even teamchemistry or the difficulty of a teamschedule or the importance of on basehits versus stacking your team withhome-run-hitting superstars Moneyball itworks you had me at on base Billy justwin a World Series would ya working onthe math right now to make it happenRobert whatever you're a front officestrategy join us tomorrow night for ourseason finale until then keep it onejust one standard deviation ahead of thecurve stats fansI'm gonna take you up on that job offerI hate it here
