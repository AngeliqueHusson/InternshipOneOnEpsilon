I said I was going to start off simpleand you're like reallythat's the subheading that doesn't looksimple and I'll let me it doesn't looksimple but it's a simple idea all thismeans congruence transformations is whatways can you change a shape that'sthat's a transformation what ways canyou change a shapeso the shape actually remains the samethat's what Congress means okay let mesay that again Congress transformationsare ways that you can change shape sothat after you changed it it's stillkind of the same shape okayI'll show you what I mean there arethree that's what we might do actuallyis a home by the way code wordstranslations is a bit of a mouthful sosometimes they just get calledtransformations okay to capture whatthese all are I'm gonna ask us to draw atable we're thinking of ways that youcan change a shape so it's actuallystill the same shape in the end okay soI'll start off with the first one andthen I wonder if you can help me get theother two out and really all the otherthings are combinations of these threeokay for each one we're going to namethe transformation and each one has a aspecial sort of technical name okay andthen we'll think of what's a more commonword that's a synonym for that so youcan actually think okay rather thangetting confused by all the terminologyokay then I'm going to show you for eachof these transformations in order to dothem you need to have some ingredientsI'll show you what I mean in a secondokaylastly and this is what the pencil ismainly for we're gonna draw one I'llshow you what I mean so that you can notjust describe that you can see it okayso here's my first one okay let's goblack John my first point oftransformation is called translationyou're like that sounds like a languagewould it is a language word but we'rethinking about it in the terms of ourshapes and moving around okay I've beenthe easiest synonym for translation itis kind of like sliding so example herewe go here's a rectangle okay eyes uphe's my rectangle now if I slide overhere like soI've changed it haven't I it like it'snot in the same place anymore but it'sstill the same shape it's the samedimensions you can describe in the sameway I've translated my rectangle okay sothat's why sliding is a similar kind ofword like you're changing its positionin order to know it for example withthis rectangle right now if you and Iwanted to make the same translation okayyou'd need to know where I moved it andhow far right for example maybe I wouldsay you know move it to the right tencentimeters well move it down somethinglike thatso what two things have I given you I'vegiven you go these ingredients rightwhich way do I go what's up what's aword for that directionah a direction but you need more thanjust a direction right you need to gohow far in that direction what's thatlike I said ten centimeters or 50centimeters a distance excellent okay soyou need a direction and a distance andthen you can do the translation and thenyou and I can do the same one right infact if you wanted to you could make itdirections and distances right becauseyou could move orto the right and down and that would bea translation right so I could combine afew togetherokay so let's quickly draw one nowinstead of doing a rectangular becausethat turns out to be rather boring okaylet's do a let off okay let's do alittle gonna be careful I'm gonna pickthe letter R no serious question seriousquestion I'm gonna ask you later on whatdo you think I picked our and not a or Bor T or two I'll let you ever thinkabout it I don't think about it cuz someof you already know it and others youlike whatever it's just random maybebecause you like cuz cuz that's Rishabhstarts with uh writing right I'll letyou have a think about it so if wetranslated this this is what it wouldlook like for instance if that was thedirection in the distance that I move todo alright the shape started I became myown shape and then it ends up over hereHachaso you can see it's still the same shapeit's still congruent that's the a fancyword for it's the same size you know youcan describe it in the same way but it'snot the same exactly I've changed ithappen thank you alright so there you gothere's a transformation
