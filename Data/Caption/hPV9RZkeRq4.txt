hello in this example we're going tolook at solving a compound inequalitythis is sometimes called a doubleinequality because essentially twoinequalities have been put together andnow we have an expression like this nowone thing you want to pay closeattention to is basically there's onetwo three pieces to this inequalityseparated by these inequality signs nowwhen we go through the solving processnot much is going to change from justsolving a normal inequality the onlything I have to remember is that if idivide by a negative number or multiplyby a negative number i want to flip bothof my signs also as i say add subtractmultiply or divide values I must do themto all three of these pieces alright sowith that out of the way let's startsolving our goal is to get X all aloneso we start by subtracting a 4 fromevery single one of these pieces thiswill give us a negative 7 is less thanor equal to a negative 2x is less thanor equal to two all right looks good nowwe need to get rid of this negative 2 sowe will divide everything by negative 2okay negative divided by a negative is apositive 7 halves now use to divide bynegative 2 will be just an x + 2 dividedby 2 negative 2 is a negative 1 nownotice negative 1 is smaller than 7halves and I / something negative that'syour clue that these symbols shouldswitch there we go so in the end it saysthat my solution X is between negative 1and 7 has let's see what that looks likeon a number line make sure you linethings up correctly negative 1 is lessthan 7 halves so it's actually way downhereand our solution is everything inbetween those two points including thepoints themselves since it says orequals to there you go so here is oursolution on a number line in intervalnotation it looks a lot like this numberline all the values between negative 1and 7 halves and I'm using thesebrackets to say that the points areincluded and there you have it if you'dlike to see some more videos pleasevisit my secret math tutor com
