welcome his lovely little curiositysuppose I took a pair of die and askedwhat's the probability of rolling sevenprobably of getting seven sum of twonumbers on a pair of die or probably ofdrawing a three or something we can workthese out in fact you might work it outas follows but you just actually draw adiagram of a table of values so thathere's all the possible roles of one dieone two three four five six is thepossible roles of a second die two fourfive six and here's the possible sumsone plus one makes two three four fivesix seven three four five six seveneight four five six seven eight ninethree six is nine yep five six seveneight nine ten six seven eight nine 1011 and seven eight nine ten six and fiveis eleven six and six is 12 here's allthe possible sums and we now see thatprobability of rolling a seven yearsI've got one two three four five sixoptions out of 36 6 out of 36 probablyrolling a 3 about two options out of 36236 and so on I can work out theprobabilities were getting eachparticular two table great so there'sthe distribution probabilitydistribution for a sum on a pair of dieI should have a lot of questions aboutthis and there might be worth looking atmy probabilities textbook volume 8 thisappears in the very first chapterthere's some several issues behind whatwhat's really going on here but that'snot the point today I'd like to talkabout today however is a discovery thata colonel made by the name of GeorgeHickman just a few decades ago thatactually these ordinary dice yes theycertainly yield some table like thisneed not be the ones you didn't have touse in a particular game he said supposeyou'd number the die instead thefollowing mannergive one die whoops elite my pen thenumerals on it six faces one to repeatthe number two threethree and fourand on the other day I get the numbers 13 4 5 6 & 8 weird let's look at theSalma's you get from this strangezickerman dice 1 plus 1 is 2 1 plus 2 is3 3 4 4 & 5 4 5 5 6 6 & 7 this is 5 six6 seven 7 & 4 plus 4 is 8 6 7 7 8 8 & 97 eight 8 nine 9 & 10 & 9 10 10 11 11and 12 so with a pair of zickermandiester you asked what's the probabilityof rolling a 7 well again there are 36possible outcomes here and a which 1 2 34 5 6 the chance to get rolling a 7 0dice is 6 out of 36 the chance ofrolling a 3 is ecumene dice were the 3is 1 2 that's it it's 236 in fact zucmandice probably rolling a 5 let's see 1 23 is that it up for 4 waste or die the 5of Sigma diceand 1 2 3 4 is 4 out of 36 in factzickerman dice to dice me number thisway get the same probabilities asordinary dice which is interesting isnow I wonder what's it like to playMonopoly with zickerman dice and itmight you know some sense you might saywho's that consume the chances ofrolling a 7 or 3 or a 12 or a 9 exactlythe same the game should be the samethere may be maybe there's an issue ofdoubles in doubles in monopoly if youall double you get to go again so maybethe doubles issues makes makes not onlydifferent with those a human alright soI've got two challenges for you onechallenge is very hard and all I sort ofgive away the outs and the challenges ifyou're gonna stick with positive wholenumbers strictly positive numbers provethat these two sets of numberings itthese are the only pairs of numbers ofdice they give the same probablydistribution asread us net sense prove that zickermandice are unique if you lay us up to goto negative numbers you actually come upwith other orderings as well but there'sonly one answer with positive integerssee if we prove that and for a less of ajuicy challenge that involves some deepmathematics instead of playing with dicewhich are six-sided cubes you could playwith tetrahedral die there does theseare for face to die so they look likelittle triangular pyramids let me drawone so ordinary tetrahedral die have thenumbers 1 2 3 & 4 and the second onewill also have the numbers 1 2 3 well bythe way how you read them if youactually roll these things you look atthe the number that's landed facedownyou know if the 3 is and the bottomfacing the table then you say the roleof this die is 3 so here's an ordinarypair of the human dice only pair oftetrahedral dice on the same sorry mychallenge to you is find the equivalenthere a different ordering of the facesof tetrahedral die the turret to beequivalent alright little bit a 3 equalsign means equivalent as ordinarytetrahedral die can you do it and then Iguess the other question is if you comewith a not so positive integers can youprove that answers unique is it uniquein this case in here.zip human dice Ohwhile I'm at it there's boumaaza a thirdchallenge well here all three died threesets of ordinary died - do do do do docan you come with a parent Sigma atriple as a human die that behaved thesame way as a triple of ordinary die Iby the way I drew three dots here andfour dots on its neighboring face umlook a pair of die that doesn't happenand yeah I've been full of distractionstoday there it iszip and ice he got to love them and lovethe fact that it was a colonel ColonelGeorge Dickerman who was playing aroundwith mathematics just for fun and camewith his wonderful set of died atsorry Bryantyou
