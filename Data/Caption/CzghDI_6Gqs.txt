welcome today we'll talk aboutdivisibility by the number 11many people know a rule for this but Iwon't explain what the rule is moreimportant explain why it's true andtherefore fun put some twists on it thatjust make things very curious andinteresting all right so first well whatis the rule for divisibility by 11 soapparently if I take a number like thisone water got it's three million twohundred eleven thousand three hundredseventy-three well I meant to do is testfor divisibility by eleven apparently isto do the alternating sum of its digitsthat is go plus three then minus 2 thenplus one and minus one that plus minusplus and the workout that automatingsome so 3 minus 2 is 1 plus 0 that givesme 1 plus this 3 or 3 is 6 minus 7 is 0well clearly 0 is a good hearty multipleof 11 which apparently means that theoriginal number itself was more of alemon that you can check that 3 2 1 1 37 3 I believe is 11 times 2 9 1 9 4 3 orsomething like thatalright here's nothing I'm eight millionthree hundred to two thousand seveneighteen to test if that's the model of11 we do that all day some of the digitsokay plus 8 minus 3 plus 5 minus 2 plusminus of plus I worked that out below Igot 8 and 8 is 16 and 7 makes our 23 thestate of 3 in the 5 makes a 21 but thenI've got this negative 2 the state of 1so when I doing that adds up to a 22 ifI did this correctly Oh which is aperfect model of 11 which apparentlymeans that this number itself 8 millionwhatever is itself a mortal 11 which youcan check it is a small example twothousand eight or sixteen plus two minus8 plus one minus six I have plus threeminus 14 that's negative 11yep negative 11 certainly in multiple of11 which means that the original numberitself was a lot of 11 all right why onearth would that work what has thealternating sum of the digits got to dowith divisibility by eleven well thereas it comes to the fact that we workwith a base 10 number system so let'slook at the powers of 10 on which ournumbers is basedso we have 1 10 100 1000 10000 and so onand let's look what happens when wedivide those by 11well clearly dividing one by 11 11 goesin zero times leaving one left over isremainder of 1dividing 10 my leaven 11 goes in zerotimes with a remainder of 10 that meansitself is 10 more than multiple of 11but I know they're in a funny way being10 more than a multiple 11 the same asbeing one less than multiple Evans Iwant to call that a remainder ofnegative onea hundred hundred is one more than 9999to put him off Elevens they must leaveremained of +1 one more than 100 11 andturns out a thousand is one less than op11 you can check that a thousand and oneis on ninety-one times 11 so it means itleaves a remainder of being equivalentnegative one made of ten technicallymost people say but I don't think it hasremained a negative one one less thanmultiple Evan and if you play this gameover and over again but but let me thinklet me think clever laters good let's goback a thousand I mean I don't you knowthis is kind of bizarre to me a thousandthink of it as 10 times 10 times 10 wewould have just said that 10 isequivalent to being leaving remainder ofnegative 1 so a thousand must be thesame thing as remained with negative 1times negative 1 times negative 1 wellneither 1 times 8 1 2 0 1 is indeednegative 1 so 10,000 which is really thenumber 10 multiplied by itself fourtimes these the same thing as negative 1multiplied by itself 4 times hasremained it which is n plus 1 so nextpower 10 10 to the 5th at least the sameremainder is negative 1 what aboutmyself 5 times negative 1 and so on sowe see this old many patterns of PlusOnes minus ones for the powers of 10which means when I'm dealing with anactual number and let's actually do anactual number like I don't know roofswith my pen and let's do 80 1263 I'mgonna think of this as eight groups of10,000 plus one group of a thousandplus two groups of a hundred plus sixgroups of ten plus three groups of oneand I can ask what happens when I lookat their remainders upon division byeleven well ten thousand these remainderof plus one what I was saying yeahthousand please remainder of negativeone one hundred Lee's remained of plus110 Lee's are made of negative one thereare three at least remainder of plus 1sorry one listener into plus oneso basically upon division by eleven Icould see that this number leaves thesame eight is eight groups of plus oneand one group of negative one and twogroups of plus one and six groups ofnegative one and three groups of plusone that is I see the alternating sum ofits digits appearing as the remainderupon division by eleven so if thisnumber itself which is the remainder isitself a mob of 11 that means a zeroremainder and the original number itselfwas a bottle of eleven amazing if thatwe proved a bit more for example we knowthat a hundred and twenty three is not amonth 11 stew more than well eleven butthis technique says actually upondivision by eleven the ordinary sum ofits digits 1 minus 2 plus 3 is the sameas the remainder and what is 1 plus 3minus 2 it is 2 so I can actually seethe ordinary sum gives the actualremainder upon division by 11 there'sone one danger with that though onedanger notice that we always want thefinal digit to be positive so if I giveyou a number like I'm making up now 3 14 4 if I did it's odd maybe some I'll go3 minus 1 plus 4 minus 4 it's not whatthe method is saying if all I care aboutis whether it's divisible by 11yes or no I could be off by minus signbut that were in effect occurs before 11so that's why you can actually be alittle flippant without which way youstart with these ordinary sums forwonder what the actual remainder is whatis 3 minus 1 plus 4 minus 4 is 2I know that is not the remainder thisnumber /11 I'm off by minus sign the correctremained is negative to equipment to 9all right all right so let's have somefun so knowing this alternating sumtrick we can have some games to do forexample one can now prove that apalindrome is likely to be a mortal of11 half the time what I mean first ofall what's a palindrome palindrome isnumber that that's grease a fourth isbackwards six whoopssix four two i claim any palindrome withan even number of digits must be a mop11can you see why that's true all rightthat leaves the question what I missabout palindrome with an odd numberdigits 3 5 2 3 5 3 does that must thatbe mod 11 so I'll let you think aboutthat one Sall Edmond pointed out to meand I said all feature that if onenumbers mortal 11let me get me number on the board thatwe've done I believe we've donesilly me we want that 3 2 1 1 3 7 3 weproved early on that small 11 let'sreverse it 3 7 3 1 1 2 3 I claim thatthe reverse of a mortal 11 is itselfgoing to be multiple evan only there's achallenge for you to think about why isreversing a bob 11th guarantee to giveyou another model of 11 in fact I'llmake this puzzle even more curious let'stake a number I know like well one I'vedone before more Gnostic with the samenumbers 8 3 5 2 7 1 8 think of this asan even digit number and I don't have aneven number digits right now I've gotthose two and those 2 and those twos letme think this is 0 8 I now claim if youflip the digits in each individual pairflip 0 + 8 8 0 3 & 5 5 3 2 & 7 7 - 1 8 81 I claimed pairwise flipping of digitsin a mortal 11 keeps the number immortal11can you see why all rightin fact that leads me through achallenge for you here's another way totest for divisible by 11let me clear the screen so let's takesomething like I need my pen back misterto listen bright bold red 8 sorry 8 3 52 7 1 8 suppose I want to test this thisdivisible 11 suppose you don't feel likedoing the ordinary something wrong Iclaim think of it's a two-digit numberlike before and you put a zero in frontand what he had to do add up thetwo-digit numbers you see Oh 8 plus 35plus 27 plus 18 add them up and Ibelieve in this case you get 88 and Iclaim if you sum up the pairs of digitsthis way and the sum is a mob of 11 thatmeant the original number itself asmultiple 11 there's an another examplelet's let's do 121 that's a pretty easyexample I think it's a two-digit number21 plus 0 1 is 22 32 is more 11 thatmeans 121 is multiple 11 so my challengefor you now is to prove why this upthere is alternative rule for divisibleEvan works and let me give you a hintthink the powers of 10 but this time I'mreally thinking powers are 100 all rightthanks so much
