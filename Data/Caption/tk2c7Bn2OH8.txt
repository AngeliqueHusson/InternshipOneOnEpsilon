today welcome to the tech math Channelwe're going to be able to look at inthis video is how to work out theperimeter harvest circle which is alsoknown as that circumference of a circleso before we start on this and how towork them out I'm going to just discussa couple of terms you'll get when youare working with circle so first off wehave this idea of a circumferencethere's my circle the circumference isthis distance around the outside okay sofrom one there and all the way around isknown as a circumference and when wemeasure it circles is a couple of waysthat we can also measure them we canmeasure them either from this point inthe middle to the edge and this here isknown as the radiusor we can use another measurement wherewhat we're looking at is say this wholeentire distance across the circle andthis is known as the diameter what youmight realize is that the diameter istwice of the radius okay because theradius is half way across it's anincentive to the edge there's anotherradius there's a radius there and aradius air so the radius is half of thediameter so that's a really reallyimportant thing that you know becausewe're going to use the radius to workout the circumference of the circle butthe way we do this is as follows we'regoing to be using we're going to use aformula which is there's no way aroundit you just have to remember formula todo this and the formula is just so thecircumference equals to PI R so twotimes pi times R now pi pi is a numberit's an irrational number it's basicallythis number which is its attained bydividing a circles circumference by itsdiameter and its values around about3.141592 dotted at it up it easiest waythat we ever usually get it is by usinga calculator okay so this is one ofthese things you will be using acalculator for and once I'll put acalculator up this is top calculator youhave on your computer what about wechange the view to a scientific one moveit across andyou'll see down here pie okay so this isa calculator that comes with yourcomputer the other ones that you guysmight use will have a button that lookslike this and that's the way you'll getthe most exact answer so some peoplewill go to use 3.14 they'll get slightlydifferent answers leave you use PI thePI button you'll get the most exactanswer so I'm going to work out thecircumference of a couple of differentcircles and a couple of different typesof questions that you might get askedokay I'll leave that formula right thereso let's work through it for say I havea circle here which is like this and Iknow that the radius is 25 centimetersso the radius from here to here is 25centimeters and we get asked to knowwhat the circumference is what theperimeter is so the formula we're goingto use is circumference equals 2 timespi times R so this is going to be thecircumference equals 2 times pitimes 25 centimetersokay so I'll get the calculator up towork this out so let's work this out nowso we end up with 2 times 5 times 25 andthis equals as you'll see here 150 7.08to be rounded point zero seven nine andaround that nine up to be point zeroeight so 157.08 so answer is this equals150 seven point zero eight one zeroeight one centimeters okay so how didyou go with that what about one more ofthese so the one I'm going to ask younow hit that formula up there is say youmight give it a question that lookedlike this maybe will actually give you aget you to work at the perimeter of thisshape here this is a terrible semicircleokay and what I'll tell you about it isthat this part here the diameter is 20centimeters so how would you work outthis distance around the outside thiscircumference we're going to see firstoff that this is half of thecircumference so there's a couple ofthings we're going to work out half thecircumference all rightso ahwe'll see for this perimeter is going toequal half of the circumference as wellas this diameter here Plus this diameterokay now this diameter is 20 so thismeans that the radius equals what theradius is half the diamond so the radiusis equal to ten centimeters okay sowe've got all the information that weneed to work this out I'll move thisover here and we'll use will doeverything working out over here okayso first off let's work out what C's nowthe circumference all the pipe and againits circumference we're going to workout what half it is but we'll get thecircumference then we'll Harvard thenwe'll add it to the diamond oh so thecircumference equals two times pi timesthe radius which is ten times tencentimeters so let's work out what thatis let me get the calculator back up soclear that two times pi times ten andthat equals 62.83 so this equals sixtytwo point eight three centimeters okaythat's a circumference but we want halfof the circumference so if half thecircumference is this about / - okay solet's just get this number here andwe'll divide it by 2 that equals 31.4 -okay so this equals 31.4 - so this isour half circumferencethen we have to add so we've got thismeasurement here okay then in fact I canrub this out I'm going to put it in herenow just to show that a little bitbetter this distance from here to herewe're going your round is thirty onepoint four two I should be putting inthe units two is just centimeters notput them in over here as wellcentimeters and so we're going to addthis to our diameter so that's fairlyeasy now okay so let's do that I'll rubout the rest of our working so far andwe're just going to add this to this so20 plus thirty one point four two we addthese together and we're going to getthe answer of this perimeter equalsthirty one point four two centimetersplus twenty centimeters equals fifty onepoint four two centimeters so how didyou go with that pretty goodhopefully are you pretty good with thosethat's type of question that you getwith these okay so give them a go I canput up actually I'll put up another oneright now just just for the heck of itanother type of question you might getasked for me why not I think the morepractice we do the better and look ifyou're fine with these you might alreadyflick it off and you'll enter the nextthing but on I'll go through a harderexample now something you may getbiddies okay to say you are asked towork out this particular shape here wehad a doorway which had a halfokay and then from there we're going todoorway and that's like the bottom of arectangle there this here is 4centimeters this from here to here is 12centimeters okay so I'm here to here solet's work out the perimeter here okayso we're going to be using circumferenceto work all this out so again what wehave here is a half circumference okayso this is this one is half of thecircumference there half thecircumference so circumference equalstwo PI R so R as you see here is goingto be this is the diameter which is 4 sothe radius is going to be half thiswhich is 2 so this equals 2 times 5times 2 so this equals let's get acalculator so clear 2 times pi times 2equals twelve point five seventwelve point five seven this should bein centimeters and this should be incentimeters so that's our that's thatwould be a full circle we're going to behalf of this so half of sin equalstwelve point five seven divided by twoequals six point two eight equals sixpoint two eight centimetersokay so I'll rub this out here and thenwe can work at this perimeter here so wehave this here as six point two eightcentimeters so perimeter is just goingto be all these added together we haveanother unknown side over here so let'sput in one as well this sides going tobe the same as this side this is goingto be equal to 12 centimeters so let'swork out our perimeterReuben up equals let's start heresix point two eight centimeters plus 12plus 4 plus 12this is going to equal let's have a lookmove this down here so we can sell we'redoing square that six point two eightplus 12 plus 4 plus twelve and thisequals thirty four point two eight okayso this equals thirty four point twoeight centimeters for the theater sohow'd you go those I hope that was somehelp okaylet's type questions you get with thosecircumference ones anyway see you nexttime
