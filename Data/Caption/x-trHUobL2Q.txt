who is art Benjamin in the MathemagicianI'm a professor at Harvey Mudd Collegethat's his day job but under the coverof night weekends and I guess someafternoons as wellhe Marvel's audiences with his feats ofmental mathematics performing for boththe common people and well-knowncelebrities art performs about 100 showsevery year and usually closes byswearing a five digit number in his headbut here we goI'll start the problem in the middlewith fifty three times six ninety sevensix ninety seven is seven hundred minusthree I'll take advantage of that nowseven hundred times fifty three isthirty seven thousand one hundred minus159 is thirty six thousand nine hundredforty one thirty six thousand ninehundred forty one two billion take theeight hundred and nine add that to gum Ithink there's gonna be a carry so I'lltake eight hundred and ten plus seventythree is eight hundred eighty threemillion five and five in okay finally wedo six ninety seven squared that's sevenhundred times six ninety four plus threesquared it's four hundred eighty fivethousand eight hundred and nine fizz upif I needed physic take the four hundredeighty five I've had two five in oh boyto get three hundred and sixty seventhousand eight hundred and nine thankyou very much so how does art do all ofthis in his head does he have anyspecial abilities I don't have I don'tthink I have what you might call somesort of savant syndrome where thesenumbers just instantly appear and I haveno way of knowing where they're comingfrom think of it more like as if youjust watched me juggle five balls orsomething nobody's born with the abilityto do that and it doesn't just happenspontaneously it's the result of a lotof practicefor me a very enjoyable mambre how didyou get started in doing mental math ohit was yeah well there was certainly atime like when I started I could squaretwo-digit numbers and then for the addedchallenge I'd work on doing three-digitnumbers I can even even have memories ofpracticing it you know we had a Iremember growing up and we had in ourbasement this old pinball machine and Iremember you know while playing pinballtrying to square three-digit numbers andand you know and getting the answer wasso satisfying that I'd want to do itagain and again and then I'd say wellright once I got good at that how aboutfour-digit numbers and and I startedrunning into some memory problems withthat and I found a way to sort of fixthat and oh I'll turn Utley the largestsite I can do once I understood my ownprocess he's better would be to multiplytwo different six digit numbers thoughthe biggest I'll do in my shows is twofive digit numbers usually I square afive digit number but sometimes when I'mfeeling ambitious and I have asufficiently tolerant and appreciativeaudience I'll multiply two differentfive digit numbers but that's donethat's a lot harder okay let's go easyhow do you multiply two two-digitnumbers so there are generally fourmethods that I use for multiplying saytwo-digit numbers and in any problem atleast one of those and often several ofthose methods will apply the simplestmethod would be called the the additionmethod take a problem like 72 times 59you could do 70 times 59 let's see350 plus 63 is 415 so 4130 plus 2 times59 which is 118 add those together fromleft to right to get 4248 so it's reallyjust the distributive law but that'sthat's what I'm doing or I could use thesubtraction methodand so there I might use 59 as 60 minusone so I might do 660 times 72 let's see6 times 72 for 20 plus 12 is 432 so Ihave 4320 minus 1 times 72 now how do Ido that well I know that's gonna be 4200in something so I'll say that somethingright I'll say that 4,200 right awayand then what's the difference between20 and 70 - well it's 52 but since it'sbeing subtracted I take the complementwhich is 48 so that's 4248 the thirdmethod that I use is the the one Iprefer to use it's easier on me mentallyis the factoring method so if I if oneof my numbers can be factored to sayinto one digit numbers like 72 then I'lllook at a problem like 59 times 72 anddo 59 times nine times eight and 59times 9 for 50 plus 81 is five thirtyone times eight is 4248 and the thirdfourth method that I do that I only canuse it occasionally is when the numbersare very close together and especiallywhen they're squared you know that's youcan't get any closer than that and thenI have a really fast method for doingthatlet's see art computing squares on thestage 78 great next 54 ok next 39 andone more 23what about harder multiplicationproblems I'm going to try to square somethree-digit numbers this time I won'teven write these down I'll just callthem out as they're called out to me242 squared is 58 thousand five hundredsixty four five eight five six four yesgood another another three-digit numbersir a three-digit number 523 is twohundred seventy three thousand fivehundred twenty nine two seven three 529yes good how about one one lastthree-digit number go ahead three-digitnumber nine six five is 930 1225let me try to take this one step furthergoing to try to square a four digitnumber this time three six seven eightthis will take me a little bit of timeso bear with me thirteen million fivehundred twenty seven thousand sixhundred eighty four good thank you verymuchwhere does memory play a role in doingmental math I do all of my mental mathfrom left to right and one of thereasons for that my original reason forthat was it would allow me to start tosay my answer while I was stillcalculating the rest of the answer youknow thereby making it look as if I hadthe answer right away because people youknow with the way we do math on paperyou were from right to leftyou can't start to say your answer untilyou have the whole thing finished so thefact that I'm starting to say the answerright away makes it look like I'm oh hegot it in three seconds no I got thebeginning of the answer in three secondsI'm still calculating the rest of theanswer and once you say part of youranswer you can quickly forget it and youknow because because I only have I don'tknow maybe ten digits of working memoryto play with and that's not a lot othertricks that he does on stage includeconstructing magic squares mathematicalcard tricks and finding the day of theweek of a given date starting with thisgentleman here what year was it if I may1973 and what month September Septemberwhat 20th was that a Thursday yessomebody else art also publishesoriginal math research his researchknowledge has inspired a new trick thathe'd like to learn here's a trick I'dlike to be able to do somedayit's called the night store now I can doa basic night store when let me explainwhat that is if if you take a chessboardand you put a knight anywhere on theboard it's possible to move that nightin such a way that it hits every squareon the chessboard exactly once and I cando that there's a nice simple algorithmfor doing so but here's something I'drather be able to do which is it's alsoa mathematical theorem that if you ifyou give me any black square and then hewhite square it's possible theoreticallyand it's been proven that you can do anice caught at or a Knights path thatcovers every square on the chessboardstarting at the given black square andending on the given white square so thatbecause that would take an extra degreeof sophistication and playing issomething that I'd like to be able to doand I know some people who are goodenough at the night store that they canbut I can't yet know maybe were I a highschool student now and had the sameamount of time that I probably put intomy mental calculations in high school Imight work hard to achieve this skillmaybe someday art also encourages othersto become Mathemagician x' and only Idon't have any claim to thisMathemagician territory if people otherpeople want to go out and and becomejunior or senior mathematicians I thinkthat's greatso do you want to be a Mathemagician367,000 809 yesthank you very much
