the set operation Union Union is the pretty much the combination of two pieces of data coming together these are all called sets okay so set a is basically the numbers 2 4 6 8 4 elements in that set those four numbers be 1 3 5 7 includes those three how I like to think of union is actually the sort of another word for marriage is Union bringing together two people so what you actually can think of is if one partner on something the other partner on something they get married they now own both things okay if say they already had joined had already on the car together they still both owned that single card there isn't that car that's owned twice okay so basically it's just sort of a collection of everything that is in either side of this relationship so a union B is basically everything that is an a and everything that's in be so looking at this a brings two four six and eight be brings one three five and seven so what we actually end up Wiz with every number one through eight you would just write that out one two three four five six seven eight so the union of a and B is this set of all this number okay let's look at one that actually has a little bit more overlap a and C okay so we're going from a which is 2 4 6 and 8 and see which is three four five and six okay well we have to be careful of here is for is an A and four isn't see it doesn't mean we have to write it twice it's still just one element that's in both of them so we just write out that number for once same with a number six so antsy is going to be the number start with two we then include three from รง for in both five from c6 from C and ate from a so the unit of to the collection the two gives us this set of numbers okay one other way you may see this in your class is by Venn diagrams if you have a being a big circle be being a big circle the union of the two is actually everything so if it's an a if it's in be if it's been both union is everything on those two collections
