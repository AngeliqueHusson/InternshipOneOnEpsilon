what I like to do is show you how toevaluate a piecewise function and we'regoing to do we need to understand whenwe reveal the piecewise function it's afunction and inside that function wehave two other functions but which makesit very confusing for a lot of studentsbut the thing that you gotta remember iseach one of these functions have what wecall constraint meaning that thefunctions are only true or only definedfor a certain amount of values soremember a function is you know you havean input and an output and you knowyou're only defined for whatever you putan input you want to get that outputonce you get that one unique output it'sit's defined for that value well whatthey're saying is these constraints onthis piecewise function it's telling youthis graph is only defined or only truewhen we use input values or X's that areless than or equal to negative 4 so thatmeans I can only plug in great numbersthat are less or equal to negative 4 andhere I can let's see I could this graphis only our function is only true whenvalues are greater than or equal to 4 soif I was actually gonna even draw this Icould actuallyx squared plus one they look somethinglike thisright and then minus seven one two threefour five six seven let's pretend that'swhyso that's what an x-squared functionlooks like that's x squared plus 1 andthis 6/7 would look something like thatall right well if I was gonna say onetwo three four what they're saying isthis graph is only true when it axes areless than negative four so what are myvalues less than negative four are lessthan four my graph is going to look likethat and then once it's greater thanfour this graph takes overkind of looks like it's not really findthe path but it's kind of very similarto each other least the way that I drewit so I don't know if that makes anymore any much closer sense but let's seehow we're gonna go eight algebraicGoogle so let's say I wanted to evaluateF of negative three so if I were toevaluate F of negative 3 I have todetermine which function am I going toput into because F of negative 3 is nottrue for both of these it's only truefor X values because remember this is Xthis is negative 3 it's only true whenit's less than or equal to negative 4 soI'm only gonna plug it into thisfunction well negative 3 times negative3 is a positive 9 9 plus 1 equals 10 andthen if I want to do F of absolute 10sets 10 is greater than 4 I'm gonna plugit only into this functionsix times out of six t-minus 10 is goingto be 53 all right so when you're doingthese just make sure that you understandwhat the constraints are and what yourvalue is that you plug in because it itdepends on what your value is and whatconstraints there are determine whereyou want to plug it your value so that'show you evaluate piecewise function
