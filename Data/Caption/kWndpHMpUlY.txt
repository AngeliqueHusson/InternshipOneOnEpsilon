can we use logarithms to find the numberof digits in a to the power B say thenumber is n let's represent the possiblevalues of n using a scalenow we make equal units with multiplesof 10 so that we cover a range from 1 to10,000 so if the number a to the power Bis 9 it'll lie between 1 and 10 if it's400 it lie between 100 and 1000 now whatif we find the log to the base 10 ofthese numbers the log of 1 is 0 the logof 10 to the base 10 will be 1 what willbe the log of 100 to the base 10 it willbe the log of 10 squared to the base 10that will equal 2 times log of 10 to thebase 10 which equals 2 and similarly wehave 3 and 4 here now the importantquestion is why did we do thislet's see any number between 1 and 10we'll have how many digits numbers like35.5 9.8 they all have one digit to theleft of the decimal pointand if we look at the log scale we cansay that if the number has one digitthen it's log will be between zero andone the logarithm will be of the formzero point something okay now look atthe second part any number between 10and 100 will have two digits correctnumbers like 22 49.1 have two digits andtheir logarithm lies between 1 and 2it'll be of the form one point somethingwe will have three digits and fourdigits in these two paths respectivelyand then logarithms will be between 2 &3 & between 3 & 4 respectively now thisgives us a very important result 0 plus1 is 1 1 plus 1 is 2 2 plus 1 is 3 and 3plus 1 is 4 when 1 is added to thenumber that we see in logs we get thenumber of digits in the number we canderive a very important property withthis iflog of n to the base 10 is of the form xpoint something then the number n willhave X plus 1 digits to the left of thedecimal point this is how logarithmshelp us find the number of digits in ato the power B let's trout an examplethere you go we have to find the numberof digits in this number and we havebeen provided with these two logarithmicvalues needless to say you aren'tallowed to use the calculator so let'stry finally the log of the numbers whatwill this be equal to we can use thelogarithmic addition identity tosimplify this a bit log of a times B isequal to log of a plus log of B applyingthe identity the right hand side can bewritten like this can be simplify thisfurther yes we can use themultiplication by a constant identitylog of a to the power N is equal to ntimes log a applying it to the firstterm we get 12 times log 2 to the base10 and applying it to the second one weget 10 times log 7 to the base 10 and wehave been provided with these two valuessubstituting them here we get thisexpression now these calculations arepretty easy the first term can bewritten as 10 times 0.301plus two times zero points three zeroone three point zero one plus zero pointsix zero two will equal three point sixone two and this will be eight pointfour five one this sum equals twelvepoint zero six three this is the logvalue of this number n but is that whatwe are asked for not really we are askedfor the number of digits in the number nand the rule we just looked at said thatif the logarithm to the base ten valueis of the form x point something thenthe number of digits in the number willbe x plus one as the number x is 12 herethe number n will have 13 digits beforethe decimal
