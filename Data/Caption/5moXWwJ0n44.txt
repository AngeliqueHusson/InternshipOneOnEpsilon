hello my name is Maria and this ismathie my mascot in this lesson we arestudying the multiplication table ofthree and that one is more difficultthan some of the others it's moredifficult than the table of five so justwork hard okay we'll start with the skipcounting pattern let's go first thefirst half of it 0 3 6 9 12 15 18 nowthat's not too difficult 0 3 6 9 12 1518 that's your turn decide 0 3 and canyou say it backwards starting with 18 1512 9 6 3 0 your turn 18 if you need topause the video go backwards andpractice that again now we'll do thesecond half from 21 to 36 21 24 27 30 33and 36 21 24 27 30 33 36 and your turn21and backwards 36:33 30-27 2421 your turn36 21 again go back in the video if youneed to practice it more now we're gonnado the whole list okay you readyyour turn 0-3 1821 and backwards forthese six3 & 0 make sure you know that list byhard before you go on and here I havethe multiplication table of three asusual the numbers from the skip countinglist go here 3 & 6 9 and 12 15 18 is 7times 3 is often difficult for childrenit is 21 24 27 and third a third is ofcourse easy 3 times 10 10 times 3 and so9 times 3 is just 1 3 less than 30 youcan go 30 minus 3 27 over here 30 andthen 33 is easy and then 36 just 3 moreso some of these are the most difficultones okay now let's practice 4 times 3is 12 5 times 3 15 10 times 3 39 timesthree just three less 27 8 times 3 is 245 times 3 15 and 7 times 3 this is thedifficult one 21 6 times 3 18 11 times 333 5 times 3 15 7 times 3 219 times 3 27 8 times 3 24 and 6 times 318 now now we do the same but I'm notgonna say the answers actually Matthewcome you yo get ok 8 times 3 6 times 3 9times 3 12 times 311 times 3 4 times 3 7 x 3 5 times 3 8times 3 9 times 3 6 times 3 3 times 3 7x 3 5 times 3 8 times 3 12 times 3 6times 3 7 times 3 9 times ok good job inthe table backwards as usual so that's 1times 3 here and 12 times 3 here in theend and all the others in between 1 2 34 and so onyou ready how many times 3 is 21 so howmany times 3 is 33 11 how many times 3is 27that's 9 see here's 10 9 how many times3 is 18 6 how many times 3 is 24 8 and1/2 times 3 is 12 4 okay I won't say theanswer's no get ready oh yeahhow many times 3 is 18 how many times 3is 24how many times 3 is 36 over hereokay I think we're all done with this
