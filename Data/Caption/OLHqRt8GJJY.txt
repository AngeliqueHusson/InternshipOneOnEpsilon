welcome it's extended deviations givenby very ghastly scary-looking formulaand most people just as soon as thescience teachers do and just accept itand bluntly go on without any kind ofunderstanding where that formula comesfrom well writer do in this video isgive the human story behind that formand explain what really happened in theinnards of evolution it's not thatdifficult here goesum we looked at with data suppose have adata set something like a three five sixsixmost people say look even what's themost typical value of a data so theytend to look at the average which iscalled new the Greek letter mu theaverage so just add up the number threeplus five or six plus six I believethat's twenty some of the numbersdivided by how many there arethis has an average value of five so insome sense fives the typical middlevalue of this data that's not enoughinformation to really sort of get asense of what's going on with the databecause if I gave you the set negative22 731 and work at is average I've justarranged things so that it will saynegative 20 plus twos negative 18 plus31 plus seven I believe that adds up to20 again I think it's 40 minus 20 yepthat's 20 divided by 4 values that alsois an average value of 5 so some sense 5is the middle value of that data but thedata is way more spread out in somesense than this data that same at fiveis a typical value of the first dataSydney has some sort of meaning to itall clustered around the number 5 we'resaying 5s the typical value of thesecond data set has less meaning there'sthose numbers always spread out so weneed some sense of spread some sense ofdeviation from the mean so it goes let'sjust do the obvious human thing whatwe'll do is say okay look my first dataset and ask how far is each particulardata value from the average well thatOlivetti 3 is 2 units away the datavalue 5 is right on the nose that's 0distance away 6 is 1 unit away 6 is oneunit away so that's the deviations ofeach individual data piece and what'sthe average deviation think the obviousthing to do to measure spread theaverage deviation would be just add upall the individual DNA divide how manywe got divided by 4 that's a 4 by 4divided by 4 is 1 since this is theaverage deviation from that meis one for do the same calculation forthe second data set the averagedeviation is now fouls each individualdata value from its mean well onnegative 20 is 25 minutes away and 2 is3 in this away and 7 is 2 units away and31 is 26 units away and that has anaverage of 4 for these deviations ofgosh when we're doing 58 oh yes 56divided by 4 divided by 4 is 28 is 14 sothe average spread is some sense for thesecond data set is 14 that tells me thisthis sense of measure of deviation isgrand it tells me that the first dataset is tightly clustered some data setspread out I've got an intuitive feelsome sort of qualification to myintruder feel that the same data is morespread out and so what have I done herewhat's the extra formula well theaverage deviation is going to be takeyour data set values so maybe the firstone we'll call X 1 in this case is 3 andwork out how far it is from the mean butI noticed I only care about how far awayit is and we care it was to the left orto the right so we use the absolutevalues to make each deviation a positivequantitythe second data value okay how far it isfrom the mean and so on and then divideby how many of these guys you've got sothere's a formula for the averagedeviation and anyone in their right mindsay that's it we don't need to doanything more than that from now on forall statistical purposes we should usethat as a measure of spread and thatwill be fine and that's good but peopledon't do that and I'll tell you whypeople don't do that it's because it'shard absolute values are obnoxiousthey're totally miserable to work withyou know as example if I asked you tosay solve this equation the absolutevalue of X is 7 you could do it withouttoo much complaining to say X either 7or it's negative version negative 7 butif we gave your equation like thisepisode value of X minus f of X minus 2plus 5 absolute value of that minus theabsolute value of X minus 2 absolutevalue of that is meant to equal oops theabsolute value of X minus 2 and askedyou to solve that you have just anightmare of a time so mathematicallyabsolute values are horrible to workwith so mathematicians being sensiblepeople saidlet's avoid them I know it seems thenatural thing to do more talk aboutspread but the mathematics is actuallyplaying with these equations ishorrendous so we need to somehow thoughget a sense of how far data values arefrom the mean and we own it in thatpositive distance so we're going to dosomething of this ilk without doingabsolute values well the next easy thingto make numbers positive is to squarethem so let's define then why can I callthe average deviation e now but it willbe right now but I will for the momentto be the numbers sort of being theabsolute values let's just square thequantities and do the same thing andtype it average and that makes perfectsense except the trouble with this nowis if I'm a scientist you should talkabout the unit's attached to my datafor example maybe my dad owes alllengths and all these valid values areinches someone to about you know threeinches minus five inches no gooddifference of two inches here plussquared it so this is now the units ofinches squared okayso just being very human how do I fixthe problem that this this measure ofdeviation is an interest squared I'drather be in inches like the originaldatawell the do the obvious thing this isnothing deep just take the square rootof that and let's define that to be ameasure of spread and people call thatSigma the standard deviation all rightthat's all it is that's all that's goingon because you do the obvious thing withabsolute values but because absolutevalues are horrible to work with youavoid them just mimic the same thing orthe next easiest thing to doing absolutevalues then you find your units lightlyofficer take the square root to fix theunits again this is a very natural thingto do very easy and if my data was righton the nose suppose I had five four datavalues that were five five five and fiveeverything was perfectly ideal world theaverage value here is five there'sactually zero to prayer there's nosecret whatsoever no deviation in factthis for me does it for me I get fiveminus five squared is zero squared pluszero squared plus zero squared plus zerosquaredtop line is 0 divided by 4 0 divided byfour is zero square root of zero zeroyep that tells me the zero sprit so itreally is doing the right thing it's midgive me some measure of spread now atthis point you might be complaining atme if you have some acknowledgedstatisticsand you will find that some books don'tdo what I've done they change somethingwhoops I need to get my pen back theychanged this denominator rather thanworking with n they choose to divide byn minus one and that is very mysteriousand very confusingwhat's even more mysterious making moreconfusing if you go to differenttextbooks and different authors youmight find they actually divided by nrather than n minus onestick with the N so changes from book tobook just to catch the confusion I'llexplain what's going on here um whenyou're doing large number data sets liketen thousand data values divided by 9999versus ten thousands nothing affectingthe calculations too much but that's notvery good when your high school studentyou know doing examples on the test wasfour or five dollar values dividing byfive is very driven from dividing byfour so we need to sort this outso my first answers go with whicheverbook formula Cobra textbook goes withbut here's with this wobble comes fromsuppose I told you that set of five datavalues does mean five and I told you onedoubt about he was 4 1 data value was 21 data value was 7 but I'm not going tobe what the last ID value is it's X doyou need to know it or could you work itout now says yes you could work it outI've told you the averages fives here togo 2 plus 3 plus 7 plus X all divided by4 is 5 and there comes a formula and allyou need to not do is just a quickalgebra homework about X's sophilosophically when I'm dealing with aset of data values I don't need all endof them just one left would be enoughbecause I forgot one less of them I canuse the the main value and work with thefourth one has to be so philosophicallywhen I do a formula involving n datavalues there's only really n minus 1pieces of actual information physicianscall this degrees of freedoms reallyonly n minus 1 degrees of freedom so toreflect that a lot of statisticians willsay look we're really dividing by nminus 1pieces of actual information let'sdivide by n minus 1 instead there's allrests on the idea that you know what muis to begin with if you don't know whatMuir's begin with and you couldn't dothis trick to work out what the 4ththe value is you don't want to put onthe right hand side which case youphilosophically want to be fighting by nso it all depends on the context of whatpersons doing with this formula in theirwork in this case that if you don't knowwhat the mirror is beforehand you knowthat you want to have a form it dividesby air if you sort of assuming that insomehow your analysis you do know whatMuir's at least philosophically you wantto divide by n minus 1 but textbooksdon't get into thattherefore they just sort of do thismission machine hand-wavy argument whyexplained by n minus 1 or some authorsdon't just divide by n and it gets veryconfusing that's the truth behind thescenes of course I talked about indetail in volume 8 of these are thinkingmathematics books that are available
