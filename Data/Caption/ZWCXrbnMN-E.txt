here look at calculating simple interesttoday and the formula for simpleinterest is interest equals principaltimes rate times time so we can alsowrite this as I for interest P forprincipal bar for rate NT for time nowinterest is the amount of interestearned or paid principal is the amountyou either invested in the first placeor the amount of loan you took out rateis the interest rate as a decimal so ifit's given as a percentage we're goingto need to divide by 100 and time is thetime in years let's look at an exampleian is investing four thousand dollarsfor two years the interest rate is fivepoint five percent how much interestwill in earn after two years well I'mgoing to set up what we know and what weneed to find out pay the interest howmuch interest will in earn that isexactly what they're asking so we don'tknow the interest that's what we have tofind out the principal is the amountthat Ian's investing so they give thatto us it's four thousand dollars therate is the interest rate as a decimalso we're going to have to take that fivepoint five percent and divide by ahundred if you wanted to punch that intoyour calculator you can feel free to dothat it would be five decimal fivedivided by 100 and T is the number ofyears so they tell us it's two yearswe're going to plug that into ourformula our first step is always towrite out the formula I equals P R T ourprincipal is four thousandour rate is zero decimal zero five fiveand our time is two if we take ourcalculator and multiply these togetherwe're going to have four thousand timespoint zero five five times two and thatgives us four hundred and forty becauseit's a word problem we're always goingto want to have our therefore statementand we want to answer the question howmuch interest will be and earn after twoyears so therefore and we'll earn fourhundred and forty dollars and interestsometimes we aren't asked for theinterest but we're actually given it sohow would we solve for the othervariables well we can set up a trianglethat looks similar to this I is at ourtop that's interest P for principal Rfor right and T for time so we know Iequals P R T what if we wanted to solvefor P well if we covered up the P herewe would be left with I equals or Idivided by R times T if we wanted tosolve for R let's just pretend this R iscovered up so we would have I divided byP times T and if we wanted to solve forT we could cover that up and we have i /ki times R let's look at some moreexamples Shirley got a $1,200 loan fortwo years she paid $90 in interestwhat was the interest rate let's findout what we have and what we need istands for interestshe paid $90 in interest so we have I isna¨ªvi P is the principal while the totalloan was for 1200 so P equals 1200 R isthe interest rate which we don't knowand T is time the loan was for two yearsso T equals two since we want to solvefor R we're going to go back and use ourformula R equals I divided by PT so Requals I divided by PTwhy is 90 P is 1200 and T is 21200 times two is 2400 and if I workthat at my calculator 90 divided by 2400I'm going to get zero decimal zero threeseven five so zero decimal zero threeseven five now that's the rate as adecimal if we wanted it as a percent wewould just move the decimal place overtwo spots and that's going to give usthree decimal seven five percent if youwanted you could take that number inyour calculator and just go ahead andmultiply it by 100 to find three pointseven five percent because it's a wordproblem I'll write my thereforestatement I'll answer the question whatwas the interest rate so therefore theinterest rate plus three point sevenfive percentlooking at our next example Doug made athree-year investment the interest ratewas 4.5% after three years he earned sixhundred and seventy five dollars ininterest how much was his originalinvestment so let's set up what we haveand what we needhe made a three-year investment so Iknow my T equals three the interest ratewas 4.5% so I'm going to write that as adecimal just have to divide by 100 andafter three years we already know that'sRt he earned six hundred and seventyfive in interest so we are being askedto find his original investment which isthe principal amount if we want to plotfind our p value remember our triangle Isee our T we want to find P our equationwould be I divided by R times T now plugin what I know Y is 675 my R is zeropoint zero four five and my T is threeand I'm going to punch in zero decimalzero four five multiplied by three togive me my denominator which is pointone three five and now finally I canpunch this in I'm going to have sixhundred seventy five divided by 0.135it's going to give me an even 5,000 soI'm going to write my thereforestatement making sure I'm answering thequestion the question was how much washis original investmentso you could say therefore is originalinvestmentwasfive thousand dollars Kim got alone forforty seven hundred dollars to buy aused car the interest rate was sevenpoint five percentshe paid one thousand fifty seven fiftyand interest how many years did it takeher to pay off her loan going to writedown what we know and what we need tofind out Kim got a loan for forty sevenhundred that is the principal amountshe'll have to pay off the interest ratewas seven point five percent so we'regoing to divide that by 100 to get ourdecimalshe paid one thousand fifty seven fiftyin interest 1057 fifteen interest howmany years that's what we have to findout if we draw a lovely triangle i p RTand we want to solve for t this time soif we cover that up we would have idivided by PR so T equals PI over P barand a sub in what we know I is onethousand fifty seven fifty P is fortyseven hundred and art is 0.075I go ahead and multiply 4700 times pointzero seven five my new denominator isthree hundred and fifty two fiftyokay so one last step I'm going todivide 1,050 750 divided by 350 250gives me three and because it's a wordproblem I'm going to write it thereforestatement how many years did it take herto pay off her loan therefore it tookher three yearsif you have any questions on simpleinterest please leave them in thecomments
