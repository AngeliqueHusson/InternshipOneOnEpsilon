Hello, everyone!And welcome to a new century!Or at least to those people who thinkwe should be counting in twelves,because to those peoplewho think we should be counting in twelves,the year 2016should be written as 1-2-0-0,meaning it's a new century--if you have two extra fingers.In fact, it's easy to count in twelves,even without two extra fingers,because you use your thumbto count the phalanges--phalanges--of your fingers, like this:one, two, three,four, five, six,seven, eight, nine,ten, eleven, twelve.So counting in twelve meansinstead of just having the usual ten symbols,from zero to nine,we're going to have two more symbolsfor ten and eleven.And so now, instead of just counting numbers in tens,and lots of tens,and tens of tens,which are hundreds,we're going to count numbers using twelves,and lots of twelves,and twelves of twelves.This system is called base twelve,or the dozenal system,and soon you'll wonder how you ever coped without it.You see, this might sound weird, or unnecessarily complicated,but if we had learned to count this way as children,it would be as natural as counting in tens.And that's what some people think we should do,including organizations such asThe Dozenal Society of America.There is a Dozenal Society of America,and they think we should be counting in twelves,because it makes every day maths easier.The multiplication table in base 12 becomes easier,because there are more repeating patterns.There are repeating patterns in the two-times table,the three-times table, the four-times table,the six-times table--the eight, nine, ten, twelve-times tables.And division becomes easier, as well.It becomes easier to divide numbersinto thirds, quarters, and sixths,which is useful, and easier to do,  in base 12,easier than base 10.And this is why old weights and measures were based on 12--like feet and inches--and old money was based on twelve.And even the hours of the day is based on the number twelve.And there are even dozenal clocks, so nowyou can never miss your favorite episode of "24."But notice the dozenal system doesn't actually change the number--it just changes how you write it.So if you took a number like 42,you would write this in dozenal as 36.So instead of being four lots of ten plus two,it's now become three lots of twelve plus six.But it's still the same number!And even the language we use is based on tens.So a word like 'forty-two' is based on tens.So in dozenal, if we use the word 'dozen' for twelve,3-6 is pronounced 'three dozen six.'And so the round numbers in dozenalbecome the multiples of twelve.So you would have one dozen,written as 1-0,you'd have two dozen,2-0,three dozen, and so on,all the way up to a dozen dozen,which is 1-0-0,otherwise known as 144,otherwise known as a gross.Don't hold it against it, it's just its name.But we're talking about a new century in dozenal,and there are equivalent words for that, as well.For example, the equivalent of a decadein dozenal, would be twelve years,and that's called an 'unquennium.'And the equivalent of a century, in dozenal,would be 144 years--a gross years--and that is called a 'biquennium.'And the greatest rap album of all time--of all time!--is Will Smith's "Willennium,"and you can't prove me wrong."Wicka-Wild-Wild-West"So we're celebrating a new biquennium,as the year 2015 becomes the year 2016,or, if you prefer,the year one dozen two gross.For more information about dozenal,you should check out The Dozenal Society of America--especially their website, dozenal.org,which has loads of good information about this stuff.And if you're really into it,you should join the society,which you can do for free.That's what I did,and you should do that,because this year,we're going to partylike it's one dozen one gross, eleven dozen eleven.And if you have been,thanks for watching!
