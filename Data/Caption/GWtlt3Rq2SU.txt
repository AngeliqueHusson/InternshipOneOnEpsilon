how do we construct a 30 degrees angleto construct an angle we need it's twoarms the initial arm and the terminalarm let's draw a ray BC put will be ourinitial arm remember array originatesfrom a point and extends indefinitely inone direction we need to construct a 30degrees angle by creating a terminal armwe keep the compass on point B and setit to any convenient width with thiswidth we draw an arc from above becrossing ray BC at Point D do not changethe width of the compass after you'vedrawn this arc with the width unchangedwe keep the compass at point D and drawan arc above D creating point E andagain do not change the width of thecompass we move the compass to point Eand draw an arc across the previous arccreating point A we draw array startingfrom point B towards a and yes this is a30 degree angle remember once we makethe first stock with the compass we maketwo more like this without changing itswidthyou
