we are given a 30-60-90 triangle namedABC it is right angled at vertex Bmeasure of angle a is 30 degrees andangle C measures 60 degrees what do weneed to prove here we have to prove thatthe side opposite 30 degrees is half thelength of the hypotenuse that is bc isequal to half AC how do we prove thatthis figure does not tell us anything sowe have to do a little bit ofconstruction to find a way out let'sextend CB to D like this such that BC isequal to BD this length should be equalto this length and then we join ad likethis because we have extended CB thisangle also will be 90 degrees now let'sanalyze our construction we areinterested in length of BC from ourconstruction we know that BC is equal toBD it means that BC will be half of DCso if we manage to prove DC equal to ACwe're done in our proof let's look attriangle ABC and triangle abd in thesetwo triangles BC is equal to BD based onour construction BC is equal to BD angleABC is equal to angle abd as both equal90 degrees and a B is equal to a Bbecause it's the common side to both thetriangles we have a side angle and sidetherefore triangle ABC is congruent totriangle abd by the SAS congruencecondition the corresponding parts ofcongruent triangles are always congruentangle ADB is equal to angle ACB as theircorresponding angles of congruenttriangles but we are given that angleACBsixty degrees it implies that angle ADBwill also be sixty degrees angle BA Dwill also be equal to angle BAC as theyare corresponding angles of congruenttriangles and angle BAC is given as 30degrees which is why angle BA D willalso equal thirty degrees both theseangles together form angle a so we getthe measure of angle a as sixty degreesnow look at triangle ADC as all threeangles equal sixty degrees we can saythe triangle ADC is equilateral allsides of an equilateral triangle areequal to each other therefore DC will beequal to AC we got what we were lookingfor as B is the midpoint of segment DCDC will be equal to twice BC thisequation can be written as 2 times BCequals AC transposing to to the otherside we get BC equals half AC in a30-60-90 triangle the length of the sideopposite the 30 degrees angle is alwayshalf the length of the hypotenuse doesthe converse also hold true we see thatin the coming videosyouyou
