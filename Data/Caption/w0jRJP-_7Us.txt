g'day and welcome to tech math Channelwhat we have been looking at in thisvideo is how to solve simultaneousequations so I'm basically only gothrough a whole bunch of examples ofthese in different videos what I'm alsogoing to put up the end of each video isa link eventually to a way once you getused to these from solving these alittle bit differently you might find ita little bit easier but I think it'sreally worth getting now this methodworked out first so the way we solvethese are first off simultaneousequations is where we have to hold yourbreak equations okay these equationsthat have these X's and Y's thesevariables in them and we use these twoequations to solve these unknownvariables okay the way that we do thisis we have to get at least one set ofthese coefficients and numbers in frontof these variables the same because yousee at the moment this is the same asone y and this is three Y this is 4x and3x so that none of them match up and itkind of is the Y's are different the X'sare different so we have to make atleast one set of them the same theeasiest way to do that is we getequation 1 here and we times it by 2 andthis is the result I'm going to putequation 1 here equation 2 there now wemultiply equation 1 by 2 we get 8x plus2y and equals 14 and equation 2 staysthe same 3x plus 2y equals 9 then whatwe can do is we can take equation one ofthe equations from the other you can seethis and we can go 8x take away 4 3x andit gives us 5x - y take away 2 y theseguys cancel each other out and 14 takeaway 9 gives us 5 so 5x equals 5 thatmeans x equals 1 now to work out whywhat we do is we substitute X into theequations here so I'll do it for bothequations up here 4 times 1 is 4 so 4times 1 equals 4plus y equals seven so four plus yequals seven that means Y is equal tothree and that's for equation one I'lltell you what I'll also substitute itinto equation 2 so same sort of thingthree times X so three X's three times Xis three plus two y we are calling Y 3so 2 times 3 is 6 and this equals 9 soindeed that is correctit means our answer is correct so I'mgoing to put a link up for the nextvideo but also for a way that you mightfind these a different way of solvingthese ok but I think it's really worthgetting this now on how to work theseout are properly anyway hope see in thenext video bye
