okay for the example of trigonometry Ihave here I'm gonna be dealing with theroof okaybecause it's a nice example which youmay probably use in the futureokay well this roof it spans fivethousand two hundred millimeters butalso has these Eve overhangson each side of 600 this roof has apitch of 23 degrees so things whichwe're going to be wanting to find outwith this roof first off it's gonna bethe heart that this roof goes to so I'lldraw a little triangle which deals withthis triangle from there to there just avery approximate sort of triangle okayand I'll move this okay this will be thefirst triangle we're going to deal withokaythat it hasthe high that we're trying to find inaddition we don't have to work we knowthe actual air at the length down hereit's going to be half of how much thisroof actually spans so five thousand twohundred divided by two is two thousandsix hundred okay that will be the firstthing we're trying to find out the nextthing we're gonna try and find out isthis rafter length here okay so I'lldraw this is a right angle triangleyeah with this right angle triangle it'sgonna be a little bit different in itsdimensions from the last one we drew andI'll show you how in just a second I'llmove it first up I'll move it down tohere where we'll deal with that in asecond as well okay you know thedimensions of this as I said is slightlydifferent the angle here is the same 23degrees as the pitch this is the lengthwe're trying to find this one down thebottom here is going to be slightlydifferent because this time it includesit has to take into account the herbsokay the rafter actually runs down rightover the eaves so I'll have to includethis 600 million so two thousand sixhundred plus six hundred three thousandtwo hundred okay cool so these are thetwo things we're going to find as youmay remember in the last video we had ontrigonometry there was a couple ofthings we had to do the first thing wehad to do was label the sides next thingwe have to do was work out the trigfunction that was sine cos or tanthen we have to substitute in values I'mjust doing it nice short while I'mwriting here and then we had tocalculate now the way that we labeldecides if you remember the sideopposite the actual angle here was knownas the officer the oldest put that inthe officer alongside the hypotenusewe're not using that but we're dealingwith the adjacent here okay so a labeldecides for this one here then we haveto work it really using sine cos or tanI had to my way of remembering this withsome old eggs charge always back thereoh okay then we're gonna be looking forthe functionusers both the opposite and the adjacentso that for this one you're gonna be tanso I'll write that down tan theta equalsthe opposite over the adjacentI remember feeder is the angle so I'llrewrite this out it while substitutingin the values and theta tan23 degrees equals the opposite theopposite X here and the adjacent is 2600all rightthen in the last video I also showed youhow I'd now work here what X is okay theway I do that is I would write out thisthing which I wrote in the last videothree legal six / - they have you're notsure this step you may want to reviewthe last video okay but for the peoplewho have done this if we're looking Xhere X lines up with a six-seater okaywhat would I do - 2 & 3 to get 6 for alot of times and so X is going to bethese two times so there's two here I'mgonna times 10 2322600and that equals I choose my calculatorso 23 tan times to 600 equals 1 103 readit up to one 104 actually I'll do it man1 104 so that's the heart work therethe next day I was working here was therafter okay so I've got my triangle downhere again first thing I do is label thesides all right so we're not dealingwith the opposite year we're gonna bedealing with the hypotenuse and theadjacent the next thing I have to do waswork at tree anomaly function okay theone that deals with I and the H which iscaused okay so I'll write that in closedbeta equals I over Hokaythe concerns that he actually caused23 degrees equals the adjacent which is3200 over the hypotenuse which is why Ifell right my 3 equals 6 over 2 andwe're dealing with we're trying to findout the 1 here the Y so Y this one herewhat we do is 6 and 3 is we'd have to go6 divided by 3 so we're gonna go 3,200glided by customer through 3,200 dividedby cos 23 grams equals jump over threethousand three hundred divided by 23that doesn't look goodbetter hit Eagles back much better threefour seven six three four seven sixmillimetersokay so that's gonna be the rifle lengthjust we have three and a half metersokay that's all pretty good the lastthing which we could also do here is wecould work out this little angle Atheaand I'll say it quickly how to do thatjust through a bit of information sothis angle here is 90 degrees this anglehere is 23 degrees yeah all angles in atriangle add up to 180 degrees so 90Plus 123there's 113 we take that away from 180we get the answer of 67 degreesthis ain't a lot beer is gonna be 67degrees anyway that's where trigonometrycan be used in the real world and that'san example I hope that helps you tounderstand trigonometry that little bitbetter I can't see any time
