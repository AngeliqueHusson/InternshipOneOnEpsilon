let me show you how to make an ellipsestarting with a circle first make acircleI used a bowl to help me then cut it outnow mark a point in the circle pull thepaper so that a random point on the edgeof the circle touches the marked pointfold a crease then draw it with a linenow do this with many different pointson the edge of the circle what do youget amazingly the lines form theboundary of an ellipse acomputer-generated picture looks likethis so why is an ellipse produced withthis folding process remember how anellipse is made if you have two fixedpoints the corresponding ellipse is theset of all blue points where the totallength of the red path never changes inour paper folding scenario start with acircle with centre o and the markedpoint P choose a point q1 on the circleand make the corresponding fold in thepaper now choose another point q2 on thecircle and also make a fold since q1 andq2 are on the circle the length of theblue segment equals the length of thered segment now let R 1 and R to denotethe points where the colored lines crossthe fold lines now draw these two newsegments the congruence of trianglesimplies that these two segments have thesame length and these two segments havethe same lengthso the length of the new red path equalsthe length of the new blue path thismeans that the set of our pointsconstructed in this way form an ellipsearound the fixed points P and O so tryit yourself fold your own lips
