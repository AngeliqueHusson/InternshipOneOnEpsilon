so in this problem in Joanne says a sub1 equals 28 a sub k plus 1 equals a subk minus 4 and what they're asking us todo is define to the first four termswe're just going to do the first fourterms so we know a sub 1 we want to nowdetermine what AC 2 is ASA 3 and ASA 4so if we know a sub 1 right 1 canrepresent our K remember recursive formwe're going to be plugging in ourprevious term into there so let's plugin a sub 1 let's plug in 1 in 4 here sothis would be a sub 1 plus 1 equals a so1 minus 4 you guys see what I did I'dplug the 1 in for the K because we knowa sub 1 now do we know what a sub 1 isit's 28 right so therefore a sub 1 + 1is a sub 2 so what that means is a sub 2equals a sub 1 which is 28 minus 4 whichequals 24 so now we know a sub 2 equals24 nownow let's put a 2 in for the K so a sub2 plus 1 equals a sub 2 minus 4 well dowe know that a sub 2 is now 24 and a sub2 plus 1 is a sub 3 so therefore now weknow that a sub 3 equals 24 minus 4which equals 20so you guys kind of see the pattern sowithout even having to do the wholerecord a sub 16 Orissa 4 is going to besix so there you go that's recursiveforma
