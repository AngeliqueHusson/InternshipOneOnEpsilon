[Music]what does it mean to prove something inmathematics a math proof is a reallyprecise logical argument you start witha bunch of axioms or principles and userigorous deduction to reach a conclusionthat conclusion is then a proven mathfact here's a great example you cancover an 8x8 checkerboard with Domino'slike this but what if we take away thesetwo corners you can't cover it withDomino's why not what's the proof pauseto give it a try yourselfokay each Domino covers one black andone white square since we removed twowhite squares there are an uneven numberof white and black squares it can't workwhat we just used is the first and mostimportant tool in our mathematical prooftoolbox watch next problem take a stickof length 1 and randomly break it twiceso it's in three pieces what's theprobability those form a trianglepause here to think about the answer thetriangle inequality is a commonly citedfact about triangles the sum of thelengths of any two sides is bigger thanthe length of the third side actuallythat's maybe the most important tool inthe mathematical toolbox relying onpreviously proved results the triangleinequality implies that the three brokenpieces will form a triangle if and onlyif all three pieces left center andright are shorter than one-half here thecenter is too long to form a trianglebut here it works so what's theprobability that all three pieces aresmaller than one half to find out drawan equilateral triangle so the bottomside is 6 make two breaks on the stickand draw a dot where the two breaks forma smaller equilateral triangle like thiswe've associated each possible way ofbreaking the stick and three pieces witha point inside the trianglethis is a bijection an extremely usefulmath tool that we talked about at lengthin our hierarchy of infinities episodemy ejections are a way of pairingobjects in one set with objects inanother set in order to compare them inthis case we've paired up all the waysto break the stick with all the pointsin the triangle here's the keyobservation if the right piece is toobig our point ends up here if the centerpiece is too big it ends up here if theleft piece is too big it ends up herebut if all three pieces are smaller than1/2 it ends up here the middle is thegood region and it's 1/4 of the entiretriangle so 1/4 of the time the breaklands in the good region and we have atriangle speaking of digestionhere's another great math facts that canbe proved using a bijection the sum ofthe natural numbers from 1 to n minus 1is n choose 2 what do I mean by n choose2 if there are n kittens then there aren choose 2 ways to select a pair of kidsfor example 4 choose 2 is fixed thereare 6 distinct pairs selected from 4kittens to demonstrate the Equalityconcretely let's say N equals 7 butnotice that importantly the proof worksfor any N first draw a pyramid of dotswith 6 dots at the base notice that thenumber of blue dots is 1 + 2 + 3 / 4 + 5- 6 now draw a final row with 7 dotsusing this diagram we can show thatthere is a bijection between pairs ofpoints in the bottom row whichrepresents 7 choose 2 and the points inthe blue pyramid which represents a sumfrom 1 to 6 any two points on the bottomrow are paired up with the point in thepyramid where the diagonal linesextending from them meet the fact thatwe can make a correspondence a/k/a byjek ssin between the pairs of points onthe bottom row and the dots in the toppyramidmeans they must be equal in number RogerNelson's book proofs without wordscontains a bunch of visual proof fromthe ancient classics to the wildly morecomplicated and modern ones Iparticularly like the simple ones thesum of the odd integers from 1 to 2 nminus 1 is N squared so for example 1plus 3 plus 5 plus 7 plus 9 plus 11 plus13 plus 15 is 8 squared or 64 actuallythere's a special mask tool calledinduction that's often use to provefacts like this which holds for allnatural numbers n to use induction youfirst prove the theorem holds for Nequals 1 then you show that if it holdsfor n then it also holds for n plus 1it's like saying my ladder has a bottomrung and every rung has one above ittherefore we can climb as high as wewant here's an example a 2 to the N by 2to the N chess board with one squaremissing can always be covered byl-shaped tiles like fit first we show itholds when N equals 1 these fourpictures show that any 2 by 2 chessboardwith 1 square missing can be covered byan l-shaped tile now assume all 2 to theN by 2 to the N boards have thisproperty here's a 2 to the n plus 1 by 2to the n plus 1 board with 1 squaremissing let's try to prove it also canbe covered break it into four equalpieces 1 has a missing square place anl-shaped tile over the other 3 likefifth now you have 4 2 to the N by 2 tothe N boards each with one squaremissing we already know all of them canbe covered by L shaped tiles so ourwhole board can we just use five classictools that show up in mathematical proofrigorous logic rejections citingprevious math results pictures andinductionnext episode we'll add a few new toolsbut these essentials will take you farwhat's your favorite proof using thesetools let us know in the comments seeyou next time on infinite series helloI'm going to respond to some comments onour infinite chest episode so melodysays how is it possible to make aninfinite move on an infinite forwardwell good question it's not really youcan make an arbitrarily large but finitemove so you can move as far as you wantyou could move a rough 10 faces or amillion spaces or a grand number ofspaces but you're right that doesn'treally make sense to move it infinitelyfar through it King F why are therethree black rooks well part of the setof an infinite chest is that you can putany number of any of the pieces on theboard so you could put three roughsCupid foot ten rope you could putinfinitely many rooks you could fill allof the squares with rooks it just bekind of a boring game they were alsoBrook Joe Lampkin does actually has someexamples of chess games that have reallyinteresting results and have infinitelymany pieces on them race and bruitpoints out that the concept we're usingis not the same as Mayton and in cheststhat's trueit's similar but different we decided todo with a clock a little differentlythan you define maintenance if you say amaton - you mean the winning player hasto make two more moves you're notcounting the moves of the losing playerto define the Doomsday Clockand to make all the Infinity stepworkouts we need to count the moves ofboth players so we need to define ourdudes they clock a little different thanchess player defined maintenance sothanks for reminding me to put thatclarification in okayhave a great weekyou
