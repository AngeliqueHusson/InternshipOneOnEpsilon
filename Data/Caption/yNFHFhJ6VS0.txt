welcome here's a cute little puzzle togive to geometry students when they'vestudied over to circle theorems and hereit is so imagine you an archaeologist orsomething like that and you'vediscovered this section of a rim of awheel and you'd like to know basicallywhat size we all this came from so whatyou do for students give them a storylike that and give them on a piece ofpaper a picture of just an arc of acircle and ask what is the size thecircle from whence it came now let's beclear on what tools we can use to workthis out I guess I have a ruler tomeasure straight lengths and actuallymeasure the lengths of these things Iguess a pencil so you draw things andlet's give a protractor so you canactually measure angles so the questionis what is the size whoops of the circlefrom which this arc came now there's alittle bit vague the words sighs what Imean by that most people interpret thatas literally how BIG's the circle interms of what is its radius so when theyapproach this problem I think okay let'sfind the center of the circle and a goalis then find the rate is that circledraw a line from the center to the arcthat will do the trick so can we findthe center of the circle the answer isyes you can do that in fact I can thinkof a couple of ways to do that and I'llgo through those but anotherinterpretation of size could be loosermaybe it's all about a knows whatfraction of the full 360 degrees isamount of turning that is was theangular measure of this arc and myquestion to you which is the real puzzlehere is there a way to work at how manydegrees this Ark represents what's themeasure this arc without finding thecenter first again only using a rulerpencil and protractor and there's a wayto do that all right but first of alllet me give the couple of ways I couldthink of using the technique of findingthe center first and these use verybasic ideas of geometry of circlegeometry and let me just whip throughthem right now one standard fact isthey've ever draw cord in a circle andfind its midpoint which we can do withthe ruler there's the midpoint and theyused in / tractor we could draw a lineat 90 degrees through that midpoint thenwe basically got the perpendicularbisector record so basic circle geometrysays the particular bias of devaney cordactually goes through the center of acircle which means if i did began for adifferent quarter just drawn the arkanywhereand find its perpendicular bisector itsure will go through the center whichmeans where they intersect is the centerof the circle and yes one source enterthe circle and get at my rule and justmeasure the radius I'm going to do itover here or anywhere on the awkward doand what's about these 2n radii i get amy protractor and actually measure theangle of turning they will ask thequestion fully and completely now cleverclever students if you really did thison a piece of paper rather than piece ofpaper this arc on it might realize youdon't need any of these tools toactually find the center the circleyou'll be very very sneaky into thefollowing take this picture of an arcwhich is on your piece of paper and holdup to the light and then on the lightjust choose some section the arc andmeasure folding the paper so thissection of arc ends up lying on top ofthe rest of the arc that you'll bemaking a crease line something like thisand then it's not hard to get everythingaway through that this this crease markis actually some line that'sperpendicular to the tangent line to thecircle and another theorem from basiccircle geometries that these linesthrough perpendicular tangent linesactually go to the center so i can dothat displays literally fall in thepaper so all you do is do it again takeanother section of our capital lightfold the paper in such a way that landson the ark itself that'll make a creasemark like this and it to have to gothrough the center of the circle so thatduring any tools no rule or no pencil Ihave now found the center of the circlenow with those tools I again measure theradio and I can measure the angleturning and got the whole answer thequestion all right but this is so centerfocused so I'd like to now address thepuzzle can we find the angle of turningthis Ark represents without goingthrough some analysis of finding thecenter first and the puzzle is can youdo it the answer is yes you can and ittoo is a nice application of basictheorems in circle geometry so if youwant to try to figure it out yourselffirst this is a good time to pausebecause I've just cleared my screen andI'm ready to give away the answer hegoes here's how you find how you findthe measure this arc there's the angularmotion of this arc without working outthe center firstall right draw a cord from the end theARCT anywhere else on the app and thendraw its matching call from the otherend with your protractor you can nowmeasure that angle X fine now that weknow x were basically done because Ihave to use a resort from geometry andhere's why these effects over sensatorithe classic resort and circle geometrynow if you ever have two cords subtendedfrom the same arc that's fancy languageseen two calls like this this inscribedangle that's what they call it inAmerica when I was a kid in astro hereto call this the peripheral anglethere's a basic fact that the peripheralangle described angle is always half themeasure of the arc it's a wonderful factabout circles about is very surprisingthere's no reason to believe that allthese angles always be the same thingthen we have the arc measure but thereit goes so what I'm going to do now isimagine that I do have the rest of thecircle and I can see right away that myarc by a by 2 green cords make ndescribed angle in which case the restof the circle is got to be double thatmeasure it says to be 2x which meansthat the arc I'm interested in is theremaining 360 degrees must have measured360 minus X so it turns out I get out myruler I'll draw two cords like this andI find this a is a hundred degrees thenI know to know right away that this archas measure 360 minus 200 only 160degrees daggers that's very Swift that'svery beautiful and some muscleapplication of this result so actuallyput it in practice why don't you gooutside and find a section of a flowerpot or something and sipping work outthe measure of that arc a lot of funthank you
