hi this is Mario with Mario's mathtutoring coming to another math video tohelp you boost your score in your mathclass improve your understanding andhopefully make learning math a lot lessstressful so in this video we're goingto talk about is how to work with thearea formula for kites and rhombi sorhombi is just plural for rhombus rightmultiple rhombus it's okay so the way wedo this is we use this formula righthere area equals one half diagonal 1times diagonal 2 so it's a pretty easyformula but the diagonal is thisdistance from this vertex to theopposite vertex so you can see thatwhole length is diagonal 1 this wholelength is diagonal 2 of course itdoesn't matter which order okay becausemultiplication is commutative and thenin a kite it's the exact same formula soit's nice you just have to take thiswhole length times this whole lengthtimes 1/2 and that gives you the areanow just a quick refresher kites okaythey have two consecutive pairs of sidesthat are congruent so you can see thatthese sides are congruent and thesesides are congruent but these are notcongruent and then in aramis all foursides are congruent and the interestingthing to note also about kites andrhombi okay are that the diagonals areactually perpendicular to one another sothey form right angles here where theycross let's look at a couple examplesyou'll understand a little bit betterhow this works so say like this firstone over here we want to find the areaalright so we have to take this wholediagonal which you can see is going tobe 3 plus 8 so that's 11 so the area isgoing to be 1/2 times 11 times thisdiagonal now you might be saying Mariowe don't know this piece right hereright well in a kite this diagonal righthere is a line of symmetry so if youfold the kite like this this anglematches with this angle this matcheswith this you can see this side matcheswith this side it's an exact you knowit's like cut in half it's the exactline of symmetry so you fold it over sothis 5 here is gonna be the same as thissegment length here 5 so that wholediagonal is gonna be 10 so if we goahead and multiply that out 1/2 times 10is 5 times 11 is 55 units squared andthat's the area of the triangle not thetriangle I'm sorry the kite but you cansee it what's interesting is that therhombus is actually made up of twotriangles and that's where the formulacomes from it looks a lot like1/2 base times height right okay solet's go ahead and look at the nextexample before I do that I just want tomention if you're preparing for the acctcheck out my AC T video course isspecifically designed for the mathsection it's got 21 different conceptareas in there that are covered on theAC T that will help you to you knowboost your score on that testso go ahead and check that out let'slook at the last example last one herewe're gonna find the area of thisrhombus notice all four sides arecongruent so we know it's a rhombus youcan see the diagonals are perpendicularand the formula is the same it's goingto be one half diagonal 1 times diagonal2 but in this case hmm they give us theside lengths but they don't give us thediagonal well we can see that this is a30-60-90 triangle one of our specialright triangles if you need to reviewthat go ahead and check out the video Idid on special right triangles but ifthis side is 6 okay according to specialright triangles this side is going to be3 right and then this side here is goingto be 3 square root of 3 so if this is 3this will also be 3 because thediagonals bisect each other okay in arhombus and then if this is 3 squareroot of 3 this will also be 3 squareroot of 3 okay so if we put that alltogether we have 1/2 this whole diagonalis 6 square root of 3 and then thiswhole diagonal is going to be 6 so if wemultiply that out we get 36 times 1/2 is18 square root of 3 units squared thatgives us the exact area of the rhombusso I hope you learned something hereabout finding area of ROM eye and kitesgo ahead and subscribe to the channeland check out some of my past videos andI'll see you in the next video I'll talkto you soon
