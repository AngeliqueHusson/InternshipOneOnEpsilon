what is pi pi is the ratio of thecircumference over the diameter pi is anirrational number and is equal toapproximately 3.14159 to better explainpilet's go over the parts of a circlefirst there is the circumference whichis the perimeter of the circle thenthere's the diameter which is a linethat splits the circle in half andthere's the radius which is half thediameter takes 3.14 diameters to make upthe circumference of a circle being thata radius is half of a diameter tick 6.28radiuses to make up this trampolinecircle so 1 pi of radiuses is half ofthe circleone Radian is 180 over pi it is theangle that takes for one radius to goalums cumferenceformula for the area of the circle is PIR squared less way to think of this isby making into a rectangle you can dothis by separating the circle from thedifferent radiuses then taking it inhalf and unfolding it so there's a bunchof triangles and placing the two halvestogether so it makes rectanglethe reason why pi is an irrationalnumber is because no matter how manytimes you separated into smaller andsmaller triangles you're always going tohave a radius at the bottom of everytriangle which you can't account for inthe area formula
