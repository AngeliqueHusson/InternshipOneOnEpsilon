Voiceover:We've got some apples hereand we've got some oranges and whatI want to think about
is, what is the ratio,what is the ratio of apples ...Of apples, to oranges?To oranges.To clarify what we're even talking about,a ratio is giving us the relationshipbetween quantities of 2 different things.So there's a couple of ways that wecan specify this.We can literally count
the number of apples.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.So we have 6 apples.And we can say the ratio is going to be6 to, 6 to ...And then how many oranges do we have?1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.It is 6 to 9.The ratio of apples to oranges is 6 to 9.And you could use a different notation.You could also write it this way.6 to ...You would still read the
ratio as being 6 to 9.But we don't have to
just satisfy us with thisbecause one way to think about ratios,especially if we're thinking about applesto oranges, is how many apples do we havefor a certain number of oranges?When you think about it that way, we canactually reduce these
numbers, as you mighthave already thought about.Both 6 and 9 are divisible by 3.So just like we can reduce fractions,we can also reduce ratios.So if you divide 6 and 9 both by 3.6 divided by 3 is 2.6 divided by 3 is 2.And 9 divided by 3 is 3.So we could also say that the ratioof apples to oranges is 2 to 3.Or if we want to use this notation,2 to 3.2 to 3.Now, does that make sense?Well look.We divided each of these groups into 3.So one way to think about it ...If you divide this whole
total into 3 groups.So 1 group, 1 group.2 groups, 2 groups.And 3 equal groups.We see that in each of those groups,for every 2 apples, for every 2 apples,we have 3 oranges.For 2 apples we have 3 oranges.For 2 apples we have 3 oranges.So, once again, the ratio
of apples to oranges.For every 2 apples we have 3 oranges.But we could think about
things the other wayaround as well.We could also think about
what is the ratio ...We could also think about
what is the ratio ...Ratio, of oranges to apples?Oranges to apples.And here we would, essentially, switchthe numbers.The ratio of oranges to apples.Notice, up here we said apples to orangeswhich is 6 to 9 or 2
to 3 if we reduce them.And here we're going to say the ratio oforanges to apples, so
we've swapped these 2.So we're going to swap the numbers.Here we have 9 oranges for every 6 apples.So we could say the ratio
is going to be 9 to 6.The ratio is 9 to 6.Or if we want to reduce
it, for every 3 oranges ...So we're going to divide this by 3.So for every 3 oranges we are goingto have 2 apples.We are going to have 2 apples.So notice, this is just
exactly what we hadup here, but when we had apples to orangesit was 6 to 9.6 apples for every 9 oranges.And now when it's
oranges to apples, we sayit's 9 to 6.9 oranges for every 6 apples.Or we could say for
every 3 oranges we haveexactly 2 apples.
