PROFESSOR BRIAN BUTTERWORTH:
These are the famous dots.So you just have to say how
many dots there are.BRADY HARAN: Two.PROFESSOR BRIAN BUTTERWORTH:
Two.That's very good.And you're quite quick.Now the next one.BRADY HARAN: Six.PROFESSOR BRIAN BUTTERWORTH: OK,
you're accurate there, butyou're a bit slower.Well, I've been particularly
interested in the last fewyears in dyscalculia, which is
a congenital condition thataffects somewhere between 3
and 6% of the population.And what it means is that
they're very, very bad atlearning arithmetic, at least
learning it in the normal way.And this seems to be a
lifelong condition.We've met a lot of adults who
have this condition, adultswho are very successful
in other branches--other walks of life.Walks of life that don't depend
very much on being goodwith numbers.I mean, they could be
filmmakers, TV producers.They could even be science
journalists.They're not going to be terribly
good at doing themaths for physics.Well, it's like dyslexia in the
following way, that it'ssomething that you're meant to
learn at school, and thatunless you have special
help, you're not goingto learn it at school.It's not exactly the same as
dyslexia, though it's oftencalled dyslexia for numbers,
because dyslexia is a problemin reading.But in fact, it's really a
problem of language, dyslexia.So you have a particular problem
with analyzing thesounds of language.And that's really what prevents
you from linkingletters with sounds,
particularly for anorthography like English
orthography, where therelationship between letters and
sounds is not particularlyconsistent.BRADY HARAN: What's the
difference between someone whohas dyscalculia and someone
who's just abit rubbish at math?PROFESSOR BRIAN BUTTERWORTH:
The difference betweendyscalculia and just being
rubbish at maths is that lotsof reasons for being
rubbish at maths.My own excuse is that I didn't
have a very goodmath teacher at school.And I didn't like him.I didn't get on with him.I've had to try desperately
to make up for that since.For example, you might miss
a lot of lessons.And since math is a kind of
cumulative subject, unlikehistory, then if you miss a lot
of stuff, it's very hardto catch up.Dyscalculia can occur in people
with high intelligence,good memories, who go to school
every day, have reallysupportive backgrounds.And yet they're unable to do
what everybody else in theirclass can do--do simple arithmetic.So there is a difference.You can often spot a
dyscalculic-- though thesearen't formal tests--in lots of different ways.For example, they have great
difficulty in rememberingtelephone numbers.They have difficulty in
remembering any numbers.So they often are going to use
the same PIN, when theyshouldn't, for lots of
different activities.They're very bad at shopping.So actually, one of the first
developmental dyscalculics wecame across was in prison.And he was in prison
for shoplifting.Why did he shoplift?Well, because he was too
embarrassed to go to thecounter, because he didn't know
how much money to give.He didn't know whether he was
getting the right change.So shopping is an area which
is really difficult fordyscalculics.They also have trouble
with time.It's not that they can't
estimate intervals.It's just that they're not very
good at the numericalside of it-- working out, for
example, what time they haveto leave home in order to
get to somewhere ata particular time.We know that there's a
particular part of the brainthat seems to be involved in
very simple number tasks.So for example, here in the
parietal lobes of the brain---this is the back of the brain.This is the left parietal and
that's the right parietal.We know that these areas are
critical for just enumeratingthe number of objects
in a set.One of the things that
we now know--this is a very recent
discovery--is that dyscalculics have
abnormalities particularly inboth of these areas, and maybe
particularly in the left inolder dyscalculics.So they have abnormal
structure.And also, the brain activates
in a different way whenthey're doing number tasks.Now, why should they have
abnormal structure or abnormalactivations?Well, there are a number
of possible reasons.We don't know all of them.One of them is these
abnormalities seem to be, insome cases, inherited.One of things we do know is
that there are particulargenetic abnormalities that seem
to affect numbers morethan other cognitive
abilities.So abnormalities in the X
chromosome seem to have aneffect on parietal lobe
development and also onnumerical abilities.So individuals with a number
of different X chromosomeconditions-- like Turner
syndrome, where you have onlyone complete X chromosome, or
Fragile X syndrome-- they seemto have a big effect on your
ability to do even very simplenumber tasks.BRADY HARAN: How do you
diagnosis this?How do you make the decision,
yep, thatperson's got the problem?PROFESSOR BRIAN BUTTERWORTH:
Well, in the study that wejust published, we used
two criteria.One is you've got to be
bad at arithmetic.And it's important to note that
it's got to be-- it'stimed arithmetic that's
critical here.Because there's a difference
between somebody who answersthe question, what's 5 plus 3,
with 8, and the individual whogoes, 5 plus 3--8.So time is a very good
diagnostic here.And we also looked
at the ability tojust enumerate sets.So how many dots are there
on the screen?Now, how good you are at this,
even in kindergarten in one ofour studies, is a very good
predictor of how muchdifficulty you're going to have
in learning arithmetic.BRADY HARAN: What is it
about counting dots?Counting dots seems to--is it just because it's a good,
easy, dependable test?Or is there something more
to it that I'm missing?PROFESSOR BRIAN BUTTERWORTH:
It's a very dependable test.So if you're bad at it at five,
you're bad at it at six,you're bad at it at seven,
you're bad at it--well, up until 11.In our longitudinal study,
that's as farwe've gone so far.So it's a very stable
indicator,so that's one reason.The other reason is because it
links to the kinds of thingsthat might be inherited, the
kinds of things that otherspecies are able to do.BRADY HARAN: What do
we do with someonewho's got it, then?Are there drugs they can take?Is there something
that can be done?Or are they a basket case?PROFESSOR BRIAN BUTTERWORTH: No,
they're not basket cases.But like dyslexia, what you
need is special kinds ofintervention.So if they're not very good at
enumerating sets, it meansthey don't have a very good
sense of the number of objectsin the set.So if it's a set of five, not
very good at enumerating itmeans they don't have
a very good sense ofwhat fiveness is.So what you have to do is you
have to have interventionsthat target that particular
weakness.So you're given lots of practice
at enumerating sets,linking that enumeration with
the symbols that we use forsets, like the word five
and the digit 5.And in fact, you can relate the
number of dots to how longit takes you.So unsurprisingly, you might say
the more dots there are,the longer it takes you to
give the right answer.But there's a very reliable
result, which we've known forat least 50 years, which is that
up to about four dots,you're very accurate and
you're pretty fast.And thereafter, it takes you
about an extra quarter of asecond for each additional
dot.And this is sometimes called
the subitizing range.And that's called the counting
or estimating range.And there's a point at which you
go from one range to theother range.And that suggests there
are actually twoprocesses at work here.And we know, actually, from
some recent mirror-imagingstudies that we've done, that
there are in fact--there's a separate part of the
brain that does the subitizingrange from the estimating
range.BRADY HARAN: At how many dots
does it become reasonable forsomeone to make a mistake?Because I feel a lot of pressure
with the dots.And if you put up 30 or so,
that would take me along time to count.PROFESSOR BRIAN BUTTERWORTH:
Right.This is a very fair point.If you give people unlimited
time and you tell them theyhave to be accurate, they'll
just count them.And they'll be pretty good
at counting them.If you give them limited amount
of time, then they cancount them up to a point.So for example, this
is from children.So it's taking them seven
seconds to get to eight dots.But if you gave them less time
to do it, then of coursethey'd have to estimate.And it looks as though for big
numbers, you use a somewhatdifferent process than when
you're doing an exactenumeration.BRADY HARAN: What do I
do for big numbers?PROFESSOR BRIAN BUTTERWORTH:
Well, you make an estimatewhich is based on extracting
various visual properties fromthe stimulus.And there's now some brilliant
work done by Marco Zorzi's labin Italy, where they've modeled
how this might work.But for numbers up to about 9
or 10-- for some people, itmight be a bit more--there's a way in which you kind
of can enumerate even ifyou're not actually
verbally counting.BRADY HARAN: I feel like when
I'm doing it, like when youshowed me the six,
I counted three.And then I kind of made a
little split and countedanother three and added
them together.Is that a normal thing?Is everyone doing that?Or are some people counting
them one by one?PROFESSOR BRIAN BUTTERWORTH:
Dyscalculics willcount one by one.This is one of the interesting
things about dyscalculics.They're very bad at doing the
estimating, using theestimating strategy.You can do it with
three and three--we've done some work on this--but you won't do it
on three and four.So you won't say, well, there's
a group of three andthere's a group of four.It doesn't give you
any advantage.For reasons we don't fully
understand, having twovisually separable groups
of the samenumber is an advantage.But having two visually
separable groups of differentnumbers, for reasons I don't
understand, doesn't give youany advantage.BRADY HARAN: Well, you
know more than me.I feel like with seven, I would
count three and four.Or maybe I would do
three and twos.I don't know.PROFESSOR BRIAN BUTTERWORTH:
Well, come into the lab forsome tests and we'll see
what you really do.BRADY HARAN: There's
two there.PROFESSOR BRIAN BUTTERWORTH:
Yes.Correct.
