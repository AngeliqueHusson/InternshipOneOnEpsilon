so welcome to my video on addingdecimals and this is much the same asadding regular numbers and the one thingyou have to remember is that thedecimals must be in a straight line sohere we have two thirty seven point fourplus six point three five one plus pointnine two and like I said the decimalsmust be in a straight line so let's setthis problem up so we can add themtogether we have two 37.4 being addedwith six point three five onenotice how the decimals are in astraight line one is exactly on top ofthe other and this is all being addedwith 0.92 and once again all threedecimals are in a straight line they areexactly on top of one another and ofcourse we need to add all these numberstogether so let's add all these numberstogether let's start all the way to theright in our thousandths unit notice howwe just have a 1 so you can bring downthe 1 if you get confusedyou always can add zeros to the end ofdecimals 237 point 4 is exactly the sameas two hundred thirty seven point fourzero zero and point nine two is exactlythe same as 0.92 zero so in our thousandstudents we have zero plus one plus zerois just one in our hundreds unit we havezero plus five plus 2 which is 7 in ourtenths unit we have four plus three plusnine which is just 16 and carry our 1 inour ones unit we have 1 plus 7 which is8 8 plus 6 is 14 carry the 1 1 plus 3 is4 and in our hundreds unit we just havea 2 so I'll just bring down the 2 andthe last thing we need to do is justplace our decimal the only thing youneed to do is just keep them in astraight line and place a decimalexactly below all the rest of themso our final answer is two hundred andforty four point six seven one so hereare some more videos with some moreexample problems related to the videoyou just watchedI really hope you're finding mytutorials helpful so until my next videoI will see you later
