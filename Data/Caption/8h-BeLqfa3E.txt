now let's try and get a deeperunderstanding of similar trianglesconsider two similar triangles triangleABC and triangle PQR vertices ABCcorrespond to vertices PQ R okaythese triangles are similar but whatelse two similar triangles convey whatdo they tell us about the sides and theangles well quite a lot I would sayfirst let's look at the sides similartriangles always have the correspondingsides in proportion in these twotriangles based on the correspondentsside a B corresponds to side PQ a B andP Q similarly side BC corresponds toside Q R and side C a corresponds tosite R P corresponding sides inproportion means the ratio of all threepairs of corresponding sides will beequal the ratio of a be 2 PQ will equalthe ratio of BC to Q R will equal theratio of C a to R P a B and P Q Rcorresponding sides BC and Q are acorresponding sides and C a and RP arealso corresponding sides but what doesthis actually mean it means that eachside is scaled up or scaled down by thesame factor here factor with which a Bis increased to get P Q is the same asthe factor with which PC is increased toget Q R or as the factor with which C ais increased to get RP so remember whenthe triangles are similar thecorresponding sides will always be inproportion now let's get to the anglessimilar triangles always have the sameshape what does that tell us about theangles yes the measures of correspondingangles of similar triangles will beequal based on the correspondenceverticies angle a corresponds to angle Pangle B corresponds to angle Q and angleC corresponds to angleRso angle a will be congruent to angle Pthis can also be written as measure ofangle a is equal to measure of angle Pit means if we take a protractor andmeasure these two angles they will beequalsimilarly angle B will be congruent toangle Q and angle C will be congruent toangle R when the triangles are similarthe corresponding angles will be equalso we can deduce all this when we aregiven that two triangles are similarhere we were given that triangle ABC issimilar to triangle PQR is similar tocan be replaced with the sine so thiscan be read as triangle ABC is similarto triangle PQR actually it also worksthe other way around if we were giveneither of these conditions we can saythat the triangles are similar remembereither of the conditions so if we aretold that all pairs of correspondingsides are in proportion we can be surethat the triangles are similar or evenif we were told that the correspondingangles are equal we can be sure that thetriangles are similar
