now we will look at the triple-scondition for similarityit means site site site conditionconsider two triangles triangle ABC andtriangle PQR assume that vertices ABCcorrespond to vertices PQ are thetriple-s condition for similarity saysthat if the corresponding sides of twotriangles are in proportion then theywill be similar so if a B by PQ is equalto BC by QR is equal to AC by PR thentriangle ABC will be similar to trianglePQR by the triple-s condition forsimilarity just this condition is enoughfor us to say that the triangles aresimilar we call ittriple-s condition since we are lookingat the three sides of each trianglelet's understand this with an example weare given two triangles with the lengthsof each of their sides we have to findout if triangles ABC and PQ are aresimilar to know that we need to find theratio of the corresponding sides ofthese two triangles let's find a B by PQfirst a B is 2 and PQ is 6 so this ratiowould equal 2 by 6 and that can bereduced to 1 by 3 now let's try findingthe ratio of bc to q r bc is given as 3units and q r is given us 9 units so thesecond ratio would be 3 by 9 which canagain be reduced to 1 by 3 this resulttells us that these two ratios are equalnow if we find out that AC by P are alsoequals the same ratio then we can saythat the two triangles are similar ac is4 units and PR is 12 unitshence we get AC by PR as 4 by 12 whichis also equal to 1 by 3as all the corresponding sides are inproportion we can say that triangle ABCis similar to triangle PQRyou
