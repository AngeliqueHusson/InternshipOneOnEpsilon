Abby and Ben did household
chores last weekend.Together they earned $50.That looks like an interesting
statement.Let me underline that.Together they earned $50 and
Abby earned $10 more than Ben.So they also tell us--let me
underline that-- Abby earned$10 more than Ben.How much did each earn?So that's the first question
that we have to answer.Then they say, if you were to
use the graph above, and I putit on the side here, which
strategy is most useful inhelping you find the answer
to the problem?So there's kind of a meta-level
question of how dowe answer that first question.Find the equation for
the blue line?Red's y-intercept?Find the points of
intersection?Fair enough.So let's just think about that
first question and then we cananswer this later, depending
on how weanswered that first question.So that first statement,
together they earned $50.What does that tell us?Well, if we say that Abby's
earnings are represented by a,and Ben's earnings are
represented by b, that tellsus that a plus b must be $50.So a plus b have to
be equal to $50.Abby's earnings plus Ben's
earnings are $50.Together they earned $50.That's all that statement
is telling us.And if we see how they graphed
things here, on the verticalaxis, what we normally associate
with the y-axis,they graphed Abby's earnings.This is Abby's earnings
right there.So we could say this
is the a-axis.And then on the horizontal
axis, what we normallyassociate with the x-axis,
they've charted Ben'searnings, so we could say
that this is the b-axis.So if we were to just map this
into the traditionalslope-intercept form, we don't
have x's and y's here.We have b's and a's.So we just want to express a
in terms of b, the verticalvariable in terms of the
horizontal variable.That's just like the y equals
mx plus b form.And the easiest way to do that
is just subtract b from bothsides of this equation.And we get a is equal to
negative b plus 50.So in this situation, you have
a slope of negative 1.Let me write this down.Slope of negative 1, that's
what's multiplying theindependent variable, and then
you have a y-intercept of 50,or maybe we should say
an a-intercept.But I'll write y-intercept
because that's what we'refamiliar with.You can view this as also like
the y or the vertical axis.y-intercept of 50.And you can see they
graphed that.You have an a-intercept or
y-intercept of 50, and theslope is negative 1.If we move 20 in the positive
x-direction, we are movingdown 20, or we're going 20
in the negative verticaldirection, or in the negative
a-direction.If we go 50 in the positive-- I
shouldn't say x-direction--the positive b-direction, we go
down 50 in the a-direction,so the slope is negative 1.So this red line right here is
the graph that depicts thisfirst constraint.It's important to realize that,
look, all this graphshows is all the different
possible combinations ofAbby's and Ben's earnings
given only this firstconstraint.Maybe Abby made $50
and Ben earned $0.Maybe Ben earned $50
and Abby earned $0.Maybe they both earned $25.Everything on this line would
be a valid combination ofAbby's and Ben's earnings given
the constraint that theyearned $50 combined.Now, the second statement.Abby earned $10 more than Ben.So if we were to write that,
that's saying that Abby isequal to Ben's earnings
plus $10.Abby earned $10 more than Ben.And here the slope is 1, you
see that right there.There's an implicit 1
multiplying times this b.And then the y-intercept
is 10.And they graphed that here.The y-intercept is 10
and the slope is 1.You move 10 in the positive
b-direction, you move up 10 inthe positive a-direction.So this blue line represents
all of the possiblecombinations of Abby and Ben's
earnings if you only had thisconstraint that Abby earned
$10 more than Ben.If Ben earns $0,
Abby earns $10.If Ben earns $10,
Abby earns $20.If Ben earns $60,
Abby earns $70.Now, we aren't dealing with only
the blue constraint oronly the red constraint.We're dealing with
both of them.We know that both of
them are true.So whatever earnings Abby and
Ben made, they have to satisfyboth constraints or they have to
sit on both of these lines.Now, what is the only point
that is sitting on both ofthese lines?Well, the only point that sits
on both lines is theintersection of those lines.That point right there is a
valid combination from thepoint of view of the blue
constraint that Abby earned$10 more than Ben.And it's also a valid point or
a valid combination from thepoint of view of the red
constraint that Abby and Benearned $50.So that point represents Abby's
and Ben's earnings thatsatisfy both constraints.And we can eyeball
it right here.It looks like Abby earned
$30 and Ben earned $20.And that makes sense.Combined, $20 plus $30 or $30
plus $20 is $50, so we meetour first constraint.And we see that Abby, $30, made
$10 more than Ben, whoonly made $20.So if you look at the point of
intersection, you will havesolved the problem.Abby made $30, Ben earned $20.So answering this second-- so
we know the answer-- so Abbyearned $30 and Ben earned $20.Now, answering the second-level,
meta-levelquestion, which is the
best strategy?We see, well, we had to find the
points of intersection, sothat is choice C.We had to find the lines'
point of intersection.Finding these other things
really wouldn't have helped ussolve the problem.
