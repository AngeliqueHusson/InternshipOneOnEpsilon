 In this video, I'm going to
expose you to what is maybeone of at least the top five
most useful formulas inmathematics.And if you've seen many of my
videos, you know that I'm nota big fan of memorizing
things.But I will recommend you
memorize it with the caveatthat you also remember how to
prove it, because I don't wantyou to just remember
things and not knowwhere they came from.But with that said, let me
show you what I'm talkingabout: it's the quadratic
formula.And as you might guess, it is to
solve for the roots, or thezeroes of quadratic equations.So let's speak in very general
terms and I'llshow you some examples.So let's say I have an equation
of the form axsquared plus bx plus
c is equal to 0.You should recognize this.This is a quadratic equation
where a, b and c are-- Well, ais the coefficient on the x
squared term or the seconddegree term, b is the
coefficient on the x term andthen c, is, you could imagine,
the coefficient on the x tothe zero term, or it's
the constant term.Now, given that you have a
general quadratic equationlike this, the quadratic formula
tells us that thesolutions to this equation are
x is equal to negative b plusor minus the square root of
b squared minus 4ac, allof that over 2a.And I know it seems crazy and
convoluted and hard for you tomemorize right now, but as you
get a lot more practice you'llsee that it actually is a pretty
reasonable formula tostick in your brain someplace.And you might say, gee, this is
a wacky formula, where didit come from?And in the next video I'm
going to show youwhere it came from.But I want you to get used to
using it first. But it reallyjust came from completing
the square on thisequation right there.If you complete the square here,
you're actually going toget this solution and that
is the quadraticformula, right there.So let's apply it to some
problems. Let's start off withsomething that we could have
factored just to verify thatit's giving us the
same answer.So let's say we have x
squared plus 4x minus21 is equal to 0.So in this situation-- let me
do that in a different color--a is equal to 1, right?The coefficient on the
x squared term is 1. b is equal to 4, the coefficient
on the x-term.And then c is equal
to negative 21,the constant term.And let's just plug it in the
formula, so what do we get?We get x, this tells us that
x is going to be equal tonegative b.Negative b is negative 4-- I put
the negative sign in frontof that --negative b
plus or minus thesquare root of b squared.b squared is 16, right?4 squared is 16, minus 4 times
a, which is 1, times c, whichis negative 21.So we can put a 21 out there
and that negative sign willcancel out just like that with
that-- Since this is the firsttime we're doing it, let me
not skip too many steps.So negative 21, just so you
can see how it fit in, andthen all of that over 2a.a is 1, so all of that over 2.So what does this simplify, or
hopefully it simplifies?So we get x is equal to negative
4 plus or minus thesquare root of-- Let's see we
have a negative times anegative, that's going to
give us a positive.And we had 16 plus, let's see
this is 6, 4 times 1 is 4times 21 is 84.16 plus 84 is 100.That's nice.That's a nice perfect square.All of that over 2, and so this
is going to be equal tonegative 4 plus or
minus 10 over 2.We could just divide both of
these terms by 2 right now.So this is equal to negative 4
divided by 2 is negative 2plus or minus 10 divided
by 2 is 5.So that tells us that x could be
equal to negative 2 plus 5,which is 3, or x could be equal
to negative 2 minus 5,which is negative 7.So the quadratic formula
seems to have given usan answer for this.You can verify just by
substituting back in thatthese do work, or you could even
just try to factor thisright here.You say what two numbers when
you take their product, youget negative 21 and when you
take their sum you getpositive 4?So you'd get x plus 7
times x minus 3 isequal to negative 21.Notice 7 times negative 3 is
negative 21, 7 minus 3 ispositive 4.You would get x plus-- sorry
it's not negative --21 isequal to 0.There should be a 0 there.So you get x plus 7 is equal
to 0, or x minus3 is equal to 0.X could be equal to negative
7 or x could be equal to 3.So it definitely gives us the
same answer as factoring, soyou might say, hey why bother
with this crazy mess?And the reason we want to bother
with this crazy mess isit'll also work for problems
that are hard to factor.And let's do a couple of
those, let's do somehard-to-factor problems
right now.So let's scroll down to get
some fresh real estate.Let's rewrite the formula again,
just in case we haven'thad it memorized yet. x is going
to be equal to negativeb plus or minus the square root
of b squared minus 4ac,all of that over 2a.I'll supply this to
another problem.Let's say we have the equation
3x squared plus 6x is equal tonegative 10.Well, the first thing we want
to do is get it in the formwhere all of our terms or on the
left-hand side, so let'sadd 10 to both sides
of this equation.We get 3x squared plus the
6x plus 10 is equal to 0.And now we can use a
quadratic formula.So let's apply it here.So a is equal to 3.That is a, this is b and
this right here is c.So the quadratic formula
tells us thesolutions to this equation.The roots of this quadratic
function, I guesswe could call it.x is going to be equal
to negative b.b is 6, so negative 6
plus or minus thesquare root of b squared.b is 6, so we get 6 squared
minus 4 times a, which is 3times c, which is 10.Let's stretch out the radical
little bit, all of that over 2times a, 2 times 3.So we get x is equal to negative
6 plus or minus thesquare root of 36 minus-- this
is interesting --minus 4 times3 times 10.So this is minus-- 4
times 3 times 10.So this is minus 120.All of that over 6.So this is interesting, you
might already realize why it'sinteresting.What is this going
to simplify to?36 minus 120 is what?That's 84.We make this into a 10,
this will become an11, this is a 4.It is 84, so this is going to be
equal to negative 6 plus orminus the square root of-- But
not positive 84, that's ifit's 120 minus 36.We have 36 minus 120.It's going to be negative
84 all of that 6.So you might say, gee,
this is crazy.What a this silly quadratic
formula you'reintroducing me to, Sal?It's worthless.It just gives me a square root
of a negative number.It's not giving me an answer.And the reason why it's not
giving you an answer, at leastan answer that you might want,
is because this will have noreal solutions. In the future, we're going to
introduce something called animaginary number, which is a
square root of a negativenumber, and then we can actually
express this in termsof those numbers.So this actually does have
solutions, but they involveimaginary numbers.So this actually has no real
solutions, we're taking thesquare root of a negative
number.So the b squared with the b
squared minus 4ac, if thisterm right here is negative,
then you're not going to haveany real solutions.And let's verify that
for ourselves.Let's get our graphic calculator
out and let's graphthis equation right here.So, let's get the graphs that y
is equal to-- that's what Ihad there before --3x squared
plus 6x plus 10.So that's the equation and we're
going to see where itintersects the x-axis.Where does it equal 0?So let me graph it. Notice, this thing just comes
down and then goes back up.Its vertex is sitting here
above the x-axis and it'supward-opening.It never intersects
the x-axis.So at no point will this
expression, will thisfunction, equal 0.At no point will y equal
0 on this graph.So once again, the quadratic
formula seems to be working.Let's do one more example,
you can never seeenough examples here.And I want to do ones that are,
you know, maybe not soobvious to factor.So let's say we get negative 3x
squared plus 12x plus 1 isequal to 0.Now let's try to do it just
having the quadratic formulain our brain.So the x's that satisfy this
equation are going to benegative b.This is b So negative b is
negative 12 plus or minus thesquare root of b squared, of
144, that's b squared minus 4times a, which is negative 3
times c, which is 1, all ofthat over 2 times a, over
2 times negative 3.So all of that over negative 6,
this is going to be equalto negative 12 plus or
minus the square rootof-- What is this?It's a negative times a negative
so they cancel out.So I have 144 plus 12, so
that is 156, right?144 plus 12, all of that
over negative 6.Now, I suspect we can
simplify this 156.We could maybe bring
some things outof the radical sign.So let's attempt to do that.So let's do a prime
factorization of 156.Sometimes, this is the hardest
part, simplifying the radical.So 156 is the same thing
as 2 times 78.78 is the same thing
as 2 times what?That's 2 times 39.So the square root of 156 is
equal to the square root of 2times 2 times 39 or we could say
that's the square root of2 times 2 times the
square root of 39.And this, obviously, is just
going to be the square root of4 or this is the square root
of 2 times 2 is just 2.2 square roots of 39, if I
did that properly, let'ssee, 4 times 39.Yeah, it looks like
it's right.So this up here will simplify to
negative 12 plus or minus 2times the square root of 39, all
of that over negative 6.Now we can divide the numerator
and the denominatormaybe by 2.So this will be equal to
negative 6 plus or minus thesquare root of 39
over negative 3.Or we could separate these
two terms out.We could say this is equal to
negative 6 over negative 3plus or minus the square root
of 39 over negative 3.Now, this is just a 2
right here, right?These cancel out, 6 divided
by 3 is 2, so we get 2.And now notice, if this is plus
and we use this minussign, the plus will become
negative and the negative willbecome positive.But it still doesn't
matter, right?We could say minus or plus,
that's the same thing as plusor minus the square root
of 39 nine over 3.I think that's about as simple
as we can get this answered.I want to make a very clear
point of what Idid that last step.I did not forget about
this negative sign.I just said it doesn't matter.It's going to turn the positive
into the negative;it's going to turn the negative
into the positive.Let me rewrite this.So this right here can be
rewritten as 2 plus the squareroot of 39 over negative 3 or 2
minus the square root of 39over negative 3, right?That's what the plus or minus
means, it could be this orthat or both of them, really.Now in this situation, this
negative 3 will turn into 2minus the square root
of 39 over 3, right?I'm just taking this
negative out.Here the negative and the
negative will become apositive, and you get 2
plus the square rootof 39 over 3, right?A negative times a negative
is a positive.So once again, you have
2 plus or minus thesquare of 39 over 3.2 plus or minus the square
root of 39 over 3 aresolutions to this equation
right there.Let verify.I'm just curious what the
graph looks like.So let's just look at it.Let me clear this.Where is the clear button?So we have negative 3 three
squared plus 12x plus 1 andlet's graph it.Let's see where it intersects
the x-axis.It goes up there and then
back down again.So 2 plus or minus the square,
you see-- The square root of39 is going to be a little
bit more than 6, right?Because 36 is 6 squared.So it's going be a little bit
more than 6, so this is goingto be a little bit
more than 2.A little bit more than 6 divided
by 2 is a little bitmore than 2.So you're going to get one value
that's a little bit morethan 4 and then another value
that should be a little bitless than 1.And that looks like the case,
you have 1, 2, 3, 4.You have a value that's pretty
close to 4, and then you haveanother value that is a little
bit-- It looks close to 0 butmaybe a little bit
less than that.So anyway, hopefully you found
this application of thequadratic formula helpful.
