okay that's do some fo fun here wecouldn't count how many written goes dowe have right here and this is meant tobe a eight by eight like a chess boardor like a checkerboard okay and keep inmind this is meant to be a square andeach square it's a great angle so byjust looking at this picture here wehave a total of eight times eight namely64 little squares so that's 64 ditogreat angles but remember this righthere it's also a great angle so it's onewhole row like this it's of course not arectangle right so the question is howmany great angles do we have right hereas always please pause the video and trythis first okay the answer to this letme just read it down right yeahyes we have a total of 1200 96 writtengoals no more no lessthis is it and if you just count rightjust seriously just count how many greatthinkers there are I think you might bestill counting right now right maybeafter I finish the video in like a 10minute or so you're still counting butyou know we are going to see if there'sany efficient way to figure this outrather than just count here is the firststrategy all right the first strategy isthat I think the complete sense theyjust call this divide and conquer maybeis like this but in math one of thepromise talking strategy is that whenyou are dealing with something hardlet's consider something that's easiersomething that's much more doableconsider smaller cases so let's see whatif we just have one by one of course youcan just count this is the we have onered tango right here right and now if wehave a two by two situation so youconsider some smaller situations andhopefully maybe this I can answer rightthere's a pattern for the answer thatyou can figure out if that's the casethat would be so wonderful isn't itand that's seelet's just count this is going to be onetwo three four and then one two threefour so total of eight right for thelittle ones and then four of the youknow that like the longer ones like thisso now have eight and keeping my we alsohave the one big one so we have a totalof nine of them right and now we willjust see to see if we can do the threeby three situation so one two three fourfive six seven eight nine right so wecan just remember that this is step ofnight for now and then let's do the twopie once so I'll just say this one twothree four five six and then that's tothis way seven eight nine eleven I meanten eleven twelve right so we put downplus twelve and now let's do the streetby one one two three four five sixall right and numbers to the two by twoyeah so this is one two three four sothat's the 2x2 and now let's do the 3 by2 3 by 2 we have 1 2 3 4 so yeah so itis 3 by 2 which is 3 per watt now thelast one is just 2 by 3 so the last onejust this so plus 1and of course we can just add this upreal quick and if you add them up thisis 10 this is another thing that's 20 sowe have 32 and then 36 so based on thefirst three cases we have one breathtango 9 8 it goes and then 36 gritankles okay all right let's see ifthere's any pattern for this how can wego from 1 to 9well that plus 8 right and how can we gofrom nine to thirty six that plus 27 andtwo we recognize these numberswe should because this right here isprecisely two to the third power it's aperfect cube this right here it'sprecisely three to the third power rightthat's also a perfect cube so you canimagine how what number do we need toadd next well we must add more to thethird power huh it seems like it andfour to the third power is going to be64 36 Plus 64 we get 100 and that'sgoing to be the number of rectangles ina four by four situation I'm going toleave you guys to verify this on yourown right because 100 I'm not going toshow you guys how to count up to 100 allright so this is kind of cool and thenext one we can just go ahead and doplus five to the third power and so onso on so on I do want to make a remarkbefore containing else this right hereit seems the gentleman but you know it'sstill not perfect in the sense that wedon't have a proof what sometimes youcannot really judge the the numbers thepattern based on the first few casessometimes the pattern may be brokenlater on that's why we had amathematical induction all rightbut at the moment just trust me thatthis is actually the correct patternright so anyway this is the 4 / 4situation let me just write this downfor you guys real quick all right sothis is the nice situation and of coursekata taught and we are going to get tothe 8 by 8 situation and of course youcan just draw the rectangle 1 2 3 4 5 67 1 2 3 4 5 6 7just motive path yeah and you justpretty much do the following so I wantedto know what this iswell the next one is going to be plus 5to the third powerright so once we get to the APIsituation this right here it has to beone to disturb power because that's oneright and then each every time just do 2to the power 3 to a third power so longso I doone to the third power plus two to thethird power plus 3 to the third powerplus dot dot up to eight to the thirdpower and by now if you have acalculator you can just you know typethis on to the calculator and you'll seethe answer is 12 96 and now some of youguys might be mad at me because I'mstill counting right so that's noteffusion at all don't worry I'm going tohelp you I'm going to make this no moneyso cool for you okaylook at this is one which is the same asone squid story on color one one squareand if you look at nine this is threesquare if you look at 36this is six square if you look at 100this is 10 square and look at 1 3 6 10can we figure out the pattern for thenext one if you just look at the pagefrom 1 to 3 is you a 2 from 3 to 6 weasked three from 6 to 10 we add 4 andyou can imagine the next one is justthat we add 5 and so on right so in facthere once we have the API situation wecould have done the following this righthere it's a same as saying let me justregister again the 10 square is the sameas saying 1 plus 2 Plus 3 plus 4 squareright for the 8x8 situation this righthere it's a same as 1 plus 2 Plus 3 plus4 plus 5 plus dot dot up to 8 and thenyou square that and now I just showedyou guys a really cool formula when youwant to find the sum of the cubes infact you need to know the sum of thefirst natural numbers and then you justsquare the result that's all so the ideais that this is counting how manyrectangles that we haveso is this they must be equal righthere's a really nice dullness it's likethe icing on the cake let me write thisdownwe have 1/2 1/3 power plus 2 to thethird power plus dot dot plus n to thethird power this right here it's equalto 1 plus 2 Plus 3 plus 4 plus dot dotplus N and then you square the resultand didn't we do this already with fivedifferent ways yes we did so oh thisright here you can watch my other videoof way if you happen it's equal to ntimes n plus 1 over 2 and then to thesecond power so this is the nice way toargue that how to find the sum of thefirst and cubes okay as I said this isthe nadanow that it's still not the best way todo this now let's do some company atwork which is like one of the best inthe world all right now go back to thebig picture let's do the big thing rightnow all rightwe're all adults now so we can handlethis we don't to look at this more casesright let me show you how to do it okaywhat makes a great angle great angle ofcourse we must have two sites and to siton the table once they're on the tableones on the bottom and then two sidesthen one on the side one on the otherlet's say if I take this rectangle fromthis poor which is a three by twosituation yes four sides of course andremember as I said we have one side hereon the top one side right here on thebottom now you see right here on theside how many lies how many horizontallines do we have you can't just wellnine-nine's by all a boy for you onehorizontal line two three four five sixseven eight nine so you see if you wantto select this as your rectangle what itiswe chose line number five for the siteto be on the top and then line numberseven for the stand to be on the bottomright and how many ways can we choosetwo lines out of a total of nine thatprecisely nine choose two isn't it rightnow choose two tells you the number ofways that we can choose two things outof a total nice things right so that'sgood and now how can we select these twosites well same argument right here wehave one two three four five six seveneight nine lines as well we just choseline number four to be the site on theleft and the night line number seven tobe the site to be on the right and guesswhatyes we still have the nachos too so letme do this actually my color wasactually not matching this right here isNiger's to right for the top and bottomand then we multiplied by nine choosetwo for the left and right so in anotherwork this right here is nothing but justand I choose two squared so I'll writethis down for you guys this is just ninechoose two and then we square that andthen choose to if you were like you cando that do it like this just put on linex the next number which is eight and youstop you just need two terms because youhave the two now it's a division thiswas not a vision all right there's nofraction part here all right on thebottom you just divide by this factorialnamely two times one and you can workthis out now nine times a is seventy-twodivided by two is 36 so you have 36square and you end up with 1296 allright and yes this right here I alsoshowed you that one plus two plus threeplus dot dot plus and it's presets theequal to n plus 1 choose 2 same exactargument we can watch my previous videofor DTO argument but theright here is a number of ways to choosethe number of sites when you know howwell you guys have seen my video so thisis another way to add one plus two plusthree plus up to n so which is this bythe way this is the quickest solution ifyou think with component work rightthat's what I like the mostanyway some discrete mathematics whichfor you guys hope you guys like thisvideo and yeah if you guys are new to mychannel please subscribe I would like tohave you here as always that's it[Music]
