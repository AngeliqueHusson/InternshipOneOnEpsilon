okay let's talk about addition let's doa long addition problem like I don'tknow - 51 + 124 alright I see that oneis straightforward I think the answersare 375 am i rightOh actually did you notice what I justdidI went 375 I went left to right do youlike that how are you taught to do ityou taught to go right select perhapswell I think you get the same answer sodoes it matter now here's a truepositive story I remember being veryconfused by this as a child in schoolbecause I was taught to read left toright in all my classes get the mathclass when it came to doing a whispertic like this we were told to go rightto left which I thought was strange sowonder why well maybe this example hereis too nice so I do a more complicatedexample yeah let's do something like 257plus 160 I know four is that betteralright here goes 2 plus 1 is 3 5 4 6 is11 7 plus 4 is also 11 311 - 11 311 T 11but I'll even prove that I'm right I'lldraw your picture here goes so this is a10-1 machine we also write that becausesociety is going to be 10 1 here 257I'll if you say 200s yep 55 10 and 7there they are and we're being asked toadd to that 164 ok add on one morehundred I can do that add on 6 more tensno worries I can do that and I'll add onformal ones please the cake so thequestion is how many hundreds do I havethree how many tens do I have uh I haveeleven of them how many ones do I have Ihave eleven of them I was right 311 T 11fact I even set it correctly 311 t t y11 this answer here is actually correctit's mathematically sorted there isnothing mathematically wrong with thisanswer though I do believe that peoplethink I'm strangewhen I say 311 211 okay the issue is notthe mathematics math is fine with thisanswer it's a society that doesn't likethis they want me to do something goodanswer so what I want to do well theydon't like me saying you Levin T so whatcan I do here well I could do someexplosions to pick this up pictures upto the side in fact I'm do an explosionhere while you do an explosion herethere now most people probably want meto go right to left I don't know why soI'll do this one here instead let'sexplode ten dots from here and see mefix up this 11 a little bit all right 10dots explode to become oneKapow exactly is one dot behind there itis it makes it actually got their 401 T11 absolutely correct nothing wrong withthat I do speak strangely their 401 T 11all right another explosion there you gois 10 from here cut out I guess thatleaves what 1 dot behind extra dot there402 T 1 that's correct that's the answersociety like so they might say 20 ratherthan 2 T that's okay now it's a stylething so there we go I actually do likegoing left to right and doing myexplosions as I go along so I no wonderwhat were you taught to do and it's whatyou were taught to do the same as what Idid really are we just doing a differentstyle of approach to mathematics here Ikind of liked it I liked 311 T 11 it's agood answer but also understand societylikes 421 - it's all good all correctmath leads to good places in the endwonderfulyou
