[PIANO ARPEGGIOS]When things move, they
tend to hit other things.And then those things move, too.When I pluck this string,
it's shoving back and forthagainst the air
molecules around itand they push against
other air moleculesthat they're not literally
hitting so much as gettingtoo close for comfort
until they get to the airmolecules in our
ears, which pushagainst some stuff in our ear.And then that sends signals
to our brain to say,Hey, I am getting
pushed around here.Let's experience this as sound.This string is pretty
special, because itlikes to vibrate in a certain
way and at a certain speed.When you're putting your
little sister on a swing,you have to get
your timing right.It takes her a certain amount
of time to complete a swingand it's the same
every time, basically.If you time your pushes to
be the same length of time,then even general pushes make
your swing higher and higher.That's amplification.If you try to push
more frequently,you'll just end up pushing her
when she's swinging backwardsand instead of going higher,
you'll dampen the vibration.It's the same thing
with this string.It wants to swing at a
certain speed, frequency.If I were to sing
that same pitch,the sound waves I'm singing
will push against the stringat the right speed to amplify
the vibrations so that thatstring vibrates while
the other strings don't.It's called a
sympathy vibration.Here's how our ears work.Firstly, we've got this ear
drum that gets pushed aroundby the sound waves.And then that pushes
against some ear bonesthat push against the cochlea,
which has fluid in it.And now it's sending waves of
fluid instead of waves of air.But what follows is the same
concept as the swing thing.The fluid goes down
this long tunnel,which has a membrane called
the basilar membrane.Now, when we have a viola
string, the tighter and stifferit is, the higher the pitch,
which means a faster frequency.The basilar membrane is stiffer
at the beginning of the tunneland gradually gets
looser so that itvibrates at high frequencies
at the beginning of the cochleaand goes through the whole
spectrum down to low notesat the other end.So when this fluid starts
getting pushed aroundat a certain frequency,
such as middle C,there's a certain part of the
ear that vibrates in sympathy.The part that's
vibrating a lot isgoing to push against
another kind of fluidin the other half
of the cochlea.And this fluid has hairs in
it which get pushed aroundby the fluid, and then they're
like, Hey, I'm middle Cand I'm getting pushed
around quite a bit!Also in humans, at least,
it's not a straight tube.The cochlea is
awesomely spiraled up.OK, that's cool.But here are some questions.You can make the note
C on any instrument.And the ear will
be like, Hey, a C.But that C sounds very
different dependingon whether I sing it
or play it on viola.Why?And then there's
some technicalitiesin the mathematics
of swing pushing.It's not exactly true that
pushing with the same frequencythat the swing is
swinging is the only wayto get this swing to swing.You could push on just
every other swing.And though the swing
wouldn't go quite as highas if you pushed every time, it
would still swing pretty well.In fact, instead of pushing
every time or half the time,you could push once every three
swings or four, and so on.There's a whole series
of timings that work,though the height of the swing,
the amplitude, gets smaller.So in the cochlea, when
one frequency goes in,shouldn't it be that part
of it vibrates a lot,but there's another part that
likes to vibrate twice as fast,and the waves push
it every other timeand make it vibrate, too.And then there's
another part thatlikes to vibrate three times
as fast and four times.And this whole series is all
sending signals to the brainthat we somehow perceive
it as a single note?Would that makes sense?Let's also say we played
the frequency that'stwice as fast as this
one at the same time.It would vibrate places
that the first note alreadyvibrated, though
maybe more strongly.This overlap, you'd
think, would makeour brains perceive these two
different frequencies as beingalmost the same, even though
they're very far away.Keep that in mind while
we go back to Pythagoras.You probably know him from
the whole Pythagorean theoremthing, but he's also
famous for doing this.He took a string that
played some note, let'scall it C. Then,
since Pythagoras likedsimple proportions,
he wanted to seewhat note the string would play
if you made it 1/2 the length.So he played 1/2
the length and foundthe note was an octave higher.He thought that was pretty neat.So then he tried the
next simplest ratioand played 1/3 of the string.If the full length
was C, then 1/3the length would give the note
G, an octave and a fifth above.The next ratio to try
was 1/4 of the string,but we can already figure
out what note that would be.In 1/2 the string was C an
octave up, then 1/2 of thatwould be C another octave up.And 1/2 of that would be
another octave higher,and so on and so forth.And then 1/5 of the string
would make the note E. But wait.Let's play that again.It's a C Major chord.OK.So what about 1/6?We can figure that one out, too,
using ratios we already know.1/6 is the same as 1/2 of 1/3.And 1/3 third was this G. So
1/6 is the G an octave up.Check it out.1/7 will be a new note,
because 7 is prime.And Pythagoras found
that it was this B-flat.Then 8 is 2 times 2 times 2.So 1/8 gives us C
three octaves up.And 1/9 is 1/3 of 1/3.So we go an octave and a fifth
above this octave and a fifth.And the notes get
closer and closeruntil we have all the notes
in the chromatic scale.And then they go into
semi-tones, et cetera.But let's make one thing clear.This is not some
magic relationshipbetween mathematical ratios
and consonant intervals.It's that these notes
sound good to our earbecause our ears
hear them togetherin every vibration that
reaches the cochlea.Every single note has the
major chord secretly containedwithin it.So that's why certain intervals
sound consonant and othersdissonant and why
tonality is like it isand why cultures that
developed music independentlyof each other still created
similar scales, chords,and tonality.This is called the overtone
series, by the way.And, because of physics,
but I don't reallyknow why, a string
1/2 the lengthvibrates twice as
fast, which, hey,makes this series the
same as that series.If this were A440,
meaning that thisis a swing that likes to
swing 440 times a second,Here's A an octave up,
twice the frequency 880.And here's E at three times
the original frequency, 1320.The thing about
this series, whatwith making the string
vibrate with different lengthsat different frequencies, is
that the string is actuallyvibrating in all of
these different wayseven when you don't hold
it down and producingall of these frequencies.You don't notice the
higher ones, usually,because the lowest pitch is
loudest and subsumes them.But say I were to
put my finger rightin the middle of the string so
that it can't vibrate there,but didn't actually hold
the string down there.Then the string would
be free to vibratein any way that doesn't
move at that point,while those other
frequencies couldn't vibrate.And if I were to touch
it at the 1/3 point,you'd expect all the
overtones not divisible by 3to get dampened.And so we'd hear this
and all of its overtones.The cool part is that
the string is pushing itaround the air at all these
different frequencies.And so the air is
pushing around your earat all these
different frequencies.And then the basilar membrane
is vibrating in sympathywith all these frequencies.And your ear puts it
together and understands itas one sound.It says, Hey, we've got some
big vibrations here and prettystrong ones here, and some
here and there and there.And that pattern is
what a viola makes.It's the difference in the
loudness of the overtonesthat gives the same
note a different timbre.And simple sine wave
with a single frequencywith no overtones makes an
ooh sound, like a flute.While reedy nasal
sounding instrumentshave more power in
the higher overtones.When we make different
vowel sounds,we're using our mouth to
shape the overtones comingfrom our vocal cords, dampening
some while amplifying others.To demonstrate,
I recorded myselfsaying ooh, ah, ay, at A440.Now I'm going to put it through
a low-pass filter, whichlets through the
frequencies less than A441,but dampens all the overtones.Check it out.[PLAYS BACK THROUGH FILTER]OK.Let's make ourselves
an overtone series.I'm going to have Audacity
create a sine wave, A220.Now I'll make another at
twice the frequency, 440,which is A an octave above.Here it is alone.[PLAYS BACK PITCH]If we play the two
at once, do youthink we'll hear the
two separate pitches?Or will our brain say,
Hey, two pure frequenciesan octave apart?The higher one must be an
overtone of the lower one.So we're really
hearing one note.Here it is.[PLAYS BACK PITCH]Let's add the next overtime.3 times 220 gives us 660.Here they are all at once.[PLAYS BACK PITCHES]It sounds like a
different instrumentfor the fundamental sine
wave but the same pitch.Let's add 880 and now 1000.That sounds wrong.All right.880 plus 220 is 1100.There, that's better.We can keep going and now we
have all these happy overtones.Zooming in to see the
individual sine waves,I can highlight one
little bump hereand see how the first overtone
perfectly fits two bumps.And the next has three,
then four, and so on.By the way, knowing
that the speed of soundis about 340 meters
per second, and seeingthat this wave takes about
0.0009 seconds to play,I can multiply those out to find
that the distance between hereand here is about 0.3
meters, or one foot.So now all these waves are
shown at actual length.So C-sharp, 1100 is
about a foot long.And each octave down is 1/2 the
frequency or twice the length.That means the lowest
C on a piano, whichis five octaves lower than
this C, has a sound wave1 foot times 2 to the
5, or 32 feet long.OK, now I can play with
the timbre of the soundby changing how loud
the overtones arerelative to each other.What your ears are doing right
now is pretty complicated.All these sound waves get added
up together into a single wave.And if I export this file, we
can see what it looks like.Or I suppose you could graph it.Anyway, your speakers
or headphoneshave this little
diaphragm in themthat pushes the air
to make sound waves.To make this shape, it pushes
forward fast here, thendoes this wiggly thing, and
then another big push forwards.The speak, remember, is
not pushing air from itselfto your ears.It bumps against the air,
which bumps against more air,and so on, until some air
bumps into your ear drum, whichmoves in the same way that the
diaphragm in the speaker did.And that pushes the
little bones thatpush the cochlea, which pushes
the fluid, which, dependingon the stiffness of the
basilar membrane at each point,is either going to push the
basilar membrane in sucha way that makes it vibrate a
lot and push the little hairs,or it pushes with
the wrong timing,just like someone
bad at playgrounds.This sound wave will
push in a way thatmakes the A220 part
of your ear send offa signal, which is
pretty easy to see.Some frequencies get pushed
the wrong direction sometimes,but the pushes in
the right directionmore than make up for it.So now all these
different frequenciesthat we added
together and playedare now separated out again.And in the meantime,
many other signalsare being sent out
from other noise,like the sound of my voice and
the sound of rain and trafficand noisy neighbors and
air conditioner and so on.But then our brain is
like, Yo, look at these!I found a pattern!And all these frequencies
fit together into a seriesstarting at this pitch.So I will think of
them as one thing.And it is a different thing
than these frequencies, whichfit the patterns of Vi's voice.And oh boy, that's a car horn.Somehow this all works.And we're still pretty
far from developingtechnology that can
listen to lots of soundand separate it out into
things anywhere nearas well as our ears
and brains can.Our brains are so good
at finding these patternsthat sometimes it finds
them when they're not there,especially if it's
subconsciously looking outfor it and you're in
a noisy situation.In fact, if the pattern
is mostly there,your brain will
fill in the blanksand make you hear a tone
that does not exist.Here I've got A220
and his overtones.[PLAYS PITCH]Now I'm going to mute A220.That frequency is
not playing at all.But you hear the pitches
A220 below this A400,even though A440 is the
lowest frequency playing.Your brain is like, Well,
we've got all these overtones,so close enough.Let me mute the highest
overtones one by one.It changes the timbre
but not the pitch,until we leave only one left.Somehow by removing
a higher note,you make the apparent
pitch jump up.And just for good measure.[PLAYS SEQUENCE OF PITCHES]But you should try it yourself.So there you have it.These notes.These notes given to us by
simple ratios of strings,by the laws of physics
and how frequenciesvibrate in sympathy
with each other.By the mathematics of
how sine waves add up.These notes are hidden in
every spoken word, tucked awayin every song.We hear them in
birdsong, bees buzzing,car horns, crickets,
cries of infants.And most of the time, you don't
even realize they're there.There is a symphony
contained in the screechingof a halting train, if only we
are open to listening to it.Your ears, perfected over
hundreds of millions of years,capture these frequencies
in such exquisite detailthat it's a wonder that we
can make sense of it all.But we do.Picking out the patterns
that mathematics dictates.Finding order.Finding beauty.
