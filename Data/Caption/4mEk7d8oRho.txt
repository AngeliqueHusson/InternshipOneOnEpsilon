OK, so we're here at the
Nottingham Forest FootballStadium, and we wanted
to find someexcuse to use the stadium.So I thought, why not talk about
the football itself?Now, it's a very special shape,
but I tell you what.For the purpose of this video,
I'm going to use this littletoy version.This is a bit clearer to see.Now, this is actually a special
mathematical shape.It's called a truncated
icosahedron.But what is an icosahedron?Let's start with that.So this prop, slightly less
glamorous, I'm afraid.It's a home-made prop.I made it out of cardboard
myself.But this is the icosahedron.It has 20 triangular faces,
and it looks like this.So now, if I cut off the
corners of this shape--we have 12 corners.If I cut them off, I will now
make my football shape, thetruncated icosahedron.So the truncated icosahedron
has 12 pentagon faces.Here they are in black.And 20 hexagon faces.There they are in white,
and they fit together.And this is your traditional
football.This was used in professional
games since the 1970s, and hasbeen more recently replaced
with a modern ball, whichactually uses fewer panels.Now, there is an advantage,
though, to using theold-fashioned ball.Because although it's slightly
counter-intuitive, thestitching around the ball makes
it a bit more rough.It makes the surface a bit more
rough, and it actuallymakes it more aerodynamic.What they find within modern
balls, because they'resmoother and are less rough,
they are actually lessaerodynamic.So they have to artificially
add dimples, and artificialgrooves, and stitching, so that
it will have the samesort of flight as the
old-fashioned balls did.Yeah, so this shape was also
used by an American architectcalled Bookie Fuller.He used to build domes
in this shape.And it's him that they named
the Bookie Ball after.The Bookie Ball is this shape.Yeah, you may have heard
of the Bookie Ball.It's also used in chemistry
because it's a molecule of 60carbon atoms, again, forming
this shape, the truncatedicosahedron.So in a Bookie Ball, we have
these 60 atoms, which are thecorners of this truncated
icosahedron shape, making thesame shape as this
football makes.
