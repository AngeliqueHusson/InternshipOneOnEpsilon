in this video I'm going to show you howto deal with permutations of n objectstaken R at a timeokay now depending on the textbook thatyou are using this would be denoted ineither of these two ways we could do Pwith parentheses in objects taken R at atime we can also use the capital P andput in objects on the left hand sidetaken R at a timeokay the formula for calculating this isgoing to be n factorial over n minus Rfactorial where ours got to be less thanor equal to n ok so that's basic formthe basic formula that we're going to beusing and one example here on how you'regoing to go about using this formulaokay so our example says find the numberof ways to listen to five different CDsfrom a selection of 15 CDs all right soin objects I have a total of 15 CDs 15objects all right so that's my in andI'm going to be taking them five at atimealright how many different ways could Ido this five at a timeso then five then is my R okay sobasically I'm going to use this formulaI'm gonna plug things in and thensimplify this out so in factorial I have15 objects so 15 factorial alright I amtaking the objects five at a time so 15minus five factorial on the bottomalright now go ahead and do a little bitof arithmetic arithmetic here 15factorial is gonna stay on the top Imight go ahead and subtract here 15minus five is gonna give me a 10factorial alright now before you startapplying the factorial and multiplyingthings out all right you can simplifythis a little bit by hand which is gonnamake sense and make things a lot easieralright if I've got 15 factorial on thetop and I've got 10 factorial on thebottom let's take that 15 factorial andstart to work it out as we would effectso 15 times 14 times 13 times 12 times11 times 10 but because I have a 10factorial on the bottom I don't want tofinish taking that out the rest away I'mgonna leave it 10 factorial right therethen with my 10 factorial on the bottomall rightI can then now okay cross this out crossthis out all right now my final answerwill be 15 times 14 times 13 times 12times 11 and when using a calculatormultiplying that out I believe it is360,000 360 all right so how manydifferent ways are there to listen tofive Denver CDs from a selection of 15CDs there's 360 thousand 360 alright sojust one quick little example thereshowing you how you can do permutationsof n objects taken R at a time showing alittle bit of the arithmetic so thatyou're doing this by hand definitelythanks for watching be sure and give mea thumbs up and share with your friendsthanks
