So let's summarize this into three different
conditions.In order for two triangles to be similar,
they can be different sizes, but everythingelse about them has to be the same.That's a really informal definition, but it's
an easy way for us to remember what we'relooking for when we're trying to identify
similar triangles.So if we apply that definition, then we can
say that these are similar triangles, andthese are similar triangles, and these are
similar triangles, and these are similar triangles.And even if I turn them, they're still similar.Now let's talk about the formal definition
so that you know how to actually prove that two trianglesare similar.Two triangles are similar if their matching
angles are congruent, and if the ratiosof their matching sides are the same.So we just said we needed angles and sides
to be the same.Let's talk about angles first.Remember that the angle measures of a triangle
don't change when the size of the trianglechanges.The three interior angles of the triangle
are always going to add up to 180 degrees.So the angle measures of these similar triangles
are both 45, 80, 55, in that order.Now let's talk about sides.In order for the triangles to be similar,
the triangles don't have to be exactly thesame size, but they do have to be proportional.So if we know that these side lengths are
3, 4 and 5, and this triangle is double thesize, then its side lengths have to be 6,
8 and 10.In other words, if we take the 3 side lengths
of one triangle, and match them up with theassociated 3 side lengths from the other triangle,
then we should be able to reduce each fractionto the same ratio.So let's summarize this into three different
conditions.First, if two triangles have the same angle
measures, and the same side lengths, thenthey are exactly the same, which means that
they're congruent.Second, if only the angles are the same and
the side lengths are proportional, then thetriangles are similar.And finally, if either the angles are different
and or the side lengths are not proportional,then the triangles aren't congruent or similar.
