okay in this video I want to talk aboutfinding the sum of a finite arithmeticseriesso remember an arithmetic sequence isjust a sequence it's just a listing ofnumbers where to go from one number toanother number there's a constantdifference so notice in my listing ofmembers I've just made here 5 to 11 to17 to 23 you're adding 6 every time toget to the next number and that's anexample of what we call an arithmeticsequence when we start actually addingthose numbers together that's when wetalk about what's called an arithmeticseries okayso series has something to do withadding the terms up and the formula saysit says the sum S sub n of the first interms of an arithmetic series looks likea sub n of an arithmetic series this isthe formula for a sub n it's a sub 1which represents the first term of thesequence of the series plus n minus 1times D and here are two equivalentformulas for the sum of those n terms wetake the number of terms and we multiplythat by the the first term plus the lastterm and then we divide that by 2 orequivalently we can take the number ofterms then we have in brackets 2 timesthe first term plus n minus 1 times D Dagain is the common difference so heremy common difference we would say our Dvalue is 6 because that's what I'madding by to get to the next term andthen again we divide that by 2 so I'mgoing to do to kind of a quick problemshereand so I put my formulas here at the topso suppose we start looking at thisarithmetic sequence 2 5 8 11 14 17notice this is arithmetic because we'readding three three three three threeeach time so our common difference is aD value of three and I'm going to do twothings I'm going to find the sum of thefirstof the first 10 terms and then I'm goingto find the sum of the series startingwith the 11th term but ending with the28th so kind of some stuff in the middleI'm going to add up okay so I can useeither one of these formulas I think I'mgoing to use the one here on the rightwhen I do Part A here so let me erase alet me erase Part B hereactually I want to point out a couplethings here - we'll do that first okayso we're adding a 1 plus a 2 plus a 3 upto a 10 we know what a 1 is it's 2 a 2is 5 a 3 is 8 we've got a formula tocalculate a sub 10 if we wanted to andthen we could just plug that in orequivalently again I'm just going to usethis formula 1 remark I want to makehere how many terms are we adding upwell we're certainly adding up 10 termsbut this is going to kind of play intothe second problems why I'm pointing itout if you start with the first term andyou soak in you end with the tenth termnotice if you subtract the the index is10 minus 1 you get 9 but we do have 10terms here so keep that in mind becauseI'm going to revisit that in the secondexample that that idea because I thinkpeople do make some mistakes but ok so Ithink this one's pretty straightforwardso to use this formula on the right itsays we take the number of terms whichwe just said is 10 it says we take 2times the first term well the first termin this case is 2 we take the number ofterms and subtract one multiply that byD again the common difference which inthis case is three and then we simplydivide all that by two so just be alittle careful with your order ofoperations let's see 2 times 2 is 4inside 10 minus 1 is 9 times 3 that'sgoing to be 27 all divided by 2well 10 divided by 2 is 5 27 + 4 isgoing to give us 31 and it says if wewere to add up all those numbers and tolist them all out we get the sum 155okay so not too bad you can certainlyuse this other formula you can compute asub n using the formula I had on thekind of the first page and then showthat you do get the same thing we'llwrite them all out and add up the first10 terms and see that you get it solet's do the second part of my problemhere and there's many different waysthat you could use the second part ofthis problem so I'm going to keep inmind we said you got 155 for Part A PartB we wanted to add the 11th term sostarting with the 11th term through Ithink I said the 28th term ok so againI'm going to use the same formula hereon the right but we just have to be alittle bit more careful about what weplug in here okay so the 11th termthat's going to be a sub 11 that's whatwe'll start with and then we would addthe 12th term the 13th term all the wayup to the 28th term so in this case nrepresents in this formula the number ofterms that you're adding up so thenumber of terms in this case this iswhere you have to be careful this iswhat I was saying a second agoyou can't just take 28 minus 11 that'snot correct it's going to be 1/2 whewand remember if we did a 1 through a 10we said if you add that up well if youcount them you certainly get 10 but ifyou subtract you get 10 minus 1 which is9 so the idea is to get the number ofterms you can subtract the indexes butthen you have to add 1 so I'm going toadd 1 to this to get the correct numberof terms so 28 minus 11 is 17 plus 1 itsays we have 18 terms that we're goingto add up and I'm just simply going tocompute the first numberand I'm going to plug it in right hereagain it's it's not a sub one of theoriginal series but it would be thefirst term of my new series so that'sthe idea okay so we said a sub n isgoing to be our first term so tocalculate the eleventh term we do haveto go back to the original so a littleconfusing here you really to think aboutwhere things are coming from so a sub 11it says we take the first term which istwo we take n minus one which is goingto be 10 times the common differencewhich in this case is three so you get30 plus 2 or 32 so that's actually goingto be I should put a sub 11 down hereexcuse me if we were to list all theseall the terms out in this this originalsequence you would find that when youget to the eleventh term that's when Iget the number 32 okay so now I'm justgoing to use this original formula againbecause I think I have the crucialinformation so we said there's going tobe 18 termsso again this one certainly a little bittrickier than the first one the firstone is pretty straightforwardso 18 terms so it says we have sets thesum of those terms it says it's going tobe n which is 18 we take two times thefirst term which would be 32 we take nminus 1 which would be 18 minus 1 or 17times the original D value which is 3and then again we have to divide allthat by 2 all right so 18 divided by 2is 9 2 times 32 that's 64 3 times 17what is that that's 51 so 64 and 51 whatdoes that looks like a 115Oh 9 times 115 what's that going to beyou can check my arithmetic I think it'sgoing to be 10:45 should be no how about10:35 that sounds better yes much betterall right so again the second problem isa little trickier because you're kind ofadding things starting in the middle sowe really have to figure out what thatthe first term would be which in thiscase would be figuring out the 11th termand that's what we did and then we werejust careful to count the number ofterms and then we just use our formulaso Part B might be a little trickier youmay have to watch it a couple times andof course as always you should reallystop and think of you know think itthrough yourself before you do anythingso there certainly I think other ways todo itthat's simply one way of doing it so allright I hope this example makes somesense and helps you out if you have anyquestions or comments feel free to postthem hopefully me or somebody else canpoint you in the right direction
