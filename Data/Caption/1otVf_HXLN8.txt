welcome least we'll explore theorem ingeometry through the theory of vectorsthis is actually appears in volumethrough the thinking mathematics seriesand how to use vectors to prove theoremsand geometry and a very nice applicationhere is given by the medians of atriangle so call so here's a trianglethree points a b c and the claim is ifyou draw the three medians of a trianglethat is a line that goes from one vertexto the midpoint of the opposite side anddo that for each of the three verticesin turn toward your juju juju jujushould make these at midpoints that'sabout me let's do that and this andfinally the third median and youthquestion is does it actually go throughthat point there and the claim is itdoes the three medians are actuallyconcurrent a single point and thatpoints usually call the centroid of thetriangle um I'd like to prove thattheorem I'd like to prove it veryswiftly using the techniques of vectorsI'm going to use my illegal approach tovectors which is actually mathematicallyvalid but most of us would use what letme do it have a look at the video onwhat is a vector to see what I met to doand I'm going to prove the threemillions of a vector are concurrent andan inclusive even more that this redmedium for example is divide it intothirds that's one third of the wholemeeting and this blue median that littleportion there is one through the wholemedian and this part of the green isalso divided into thirds so I claim thethree medians are concurrent and theymeet at a point that chops each 30meeting at the one-third mark he goesalright how did I could how to constructthis red median well I start at themidpoint of side B and C and through myvector approach that means I could startat the B and then go halfway along fromB to C and that will give me at thismidpoint using my lovely illegalnotation this is half C minus B so thisis actually a much bigger one B - half abeer but half a B and I've got half of Cso the midpoint is actually B - C and Iclaim then if I go 1/3 of the waytowards a I give the special locationthat works for all three meetings at thesame time well let's get the court atthat point now I wanna start at thismidpoint B plus C over 2 and go 1/3 ofthe way from that midpoint to a wellusing my wonderful legal legalthat is mathematically actually soundthere it is there's the formula for whatthat point is well in surface tosimplify this a bithow many HIV I've got 1/3 of a andthat's it for B so it happen would beminus 1/3 of 1/2 of B and so half of Bminus 1/6 of B that's 1/3 of B and howmuch C do I have half of C at the samewhat here 1/3 of 1/2 and C that's 1/2minus 6 is 1/3 of C so the corner is thespecial point the centroid well thespecial point I should say is this so ifI go from the midpoint of be seen what1/2 1/3 of the way along to see I get toa point with these corners but actuallylook at this formula symmetrical ittells me I've been effective exactly thesame works down the midpoint of aid or aand B and walk one foot of the waytowards C it be the exactly the samesort of work as my letters arerearranged but in the end I get ananswer that must be equally symmetricalmust be this answer and you know for thethird median start at the midpoint aplus C over 2 and work 1/3 of the way towalk through the way towards B do thesame work I bet you get this answer aswell that is all three medians if you goone foot of the way in or land at thesame place therefore the three mediansare indeed concurrent and here's anactual formula for the MIT for thatcentroid I for example let me show youwhat I mean by it's really is formulasuppose I tell you that a has corner - Iknow - 3 and C has coordinates negative1/5 and B has coordinates 0 9 then thisformula says that the centroid mostpeople tend to call G will havecoordinates given by now this formula isthough it doesn't make sense to addpoints if this formula actuallyrepresent the mathematics of doing thison each component level so for the Xcorners thing and 1/3 of the echo of a2/3 go to the X corner for B negative1/3 and 1/3 of that school and that's 4be sorry thy sister Cecilia is the thirdof 0 so it's 2/3 minus 1/3 plus 0 it's1/3 comma now do it for the white oneit's one third of the Y corner of a is 11 3 to the Y corner for B is 3 one footof the y qualit for C is 5/3so that's L 1 4 and 5 and 1/3there it is there's the actual cornersfor where the three meetings intersectin this triangle amazing um you can domore work of this ilk by using vectorsimprove fabulous fabrics theorems andgeometry and go a little bit furtherwhat you could do we can actually givecoordinates to point special points andtriangles and so forth by the spectraapproach great thank you very much
