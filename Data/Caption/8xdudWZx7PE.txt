here we look at doing this problem weneed to do a conversion because one ofthe masses is in grams and the other oneis in kilograms and whenever we're doinga calculation using any forcesespecially using things like Newton'ssecond law you need to have it inkilograms so here's our block 1.2 123point 4 grams on top of it is a 1kilogram massI do this calculation 123 point fourgrams needs to be converted intokilogramsso here's we've got 123 point four gramswe're going to multiply it by a ratiothe ratio is one kilogram over 1,000grams okay now one kilogram over 1,000grams is basically just the number onebut if you notice you've got grams onthe top grams on the bottom so we cancancel it offand now if we do some multiplicationyou've got 123 point 4 with kilograms onthe top divided by 1000 on the bottomwhich gives us 0 point 1 2 3 4 kilogramsso that is 120 three point four gramsconverted into kilograms okay now thatwe've done a conversion we're going tojust quickly rece catch the free bodydiagram with our converted mass so ourwooden block with our 1 kilogram masssitting on top so point 1 2 3 4kilograms is the wooden block the 1kilogram mass sitting on top so now ifwe want to calculate the force ofgravity for Freebody diagram it's Mtimes G our M will be two combinedmasses of the wooden block and the 1kilogram mass sitting on top so it's oneplus point one two three fourtimes 9.8 meters per second squared sowe get a weight or an F G of 11.0 andwhen we round it one Newton's we can puta negative in front just for directionbut we're just looking for how tocalculate this
