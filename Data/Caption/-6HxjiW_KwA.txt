this episode is supported by Squarespacerandomness is everywhere but somewhatsurprisingly the mathematical study ofprobability began relatively recentlywhen a troubled gambler reached out to amathematician for help let's start witha word probability it and its relativesprobable probabilistic derived from thelatin probabilists which was primarilyused in the morally evaluative term tomean that something was worthy ofapproval as in a probable doctor is atrustworthy one more recently thederivatives of probabilists can expressa tentative judgement something morelike an intuition or opinion as in thathairstyle we'll probably go out offashion soon and of course to saysomething is probable can be a statementabout factual knowledge which requiresevidence or analytic reasoningthroughout much of human history peopleconsciously and intentionally producedrandomness they frequently used dice ordice shaped animal bones and otherrandom objects to gamble forentertainment to predict the future andto communicate with deities despite allthis engagement with controlled randomprocesses people didn't really think ofprobability in mathematical terms priorto 1600 all of the ingredients werethere people had rigorous series ofgeometry and algebra and the ability torig a game of dice would have certainlyprovided an incentive to studyprobability but there's very littleevidence that they thought aboutrandomness in mathematical termssuddenly in the mid 17th centuryrigorous probabilistic reasoning begancropping up everywhere a correspondencebetween Blaise Pascal and Pierre deforma in response to a gamblers questionis often credited as the first formalinquiry into probability theory here's aversion of what they wrote about ray andrusty are playing the most boringgambling game evereach round they flip a coin if it'sheads ray gets a point and tails rustygets a point first person to 100 pointswins before the game began both playerscontributeddollars to the pot and agreed that thewinner would get all $40 but they getinterrupted before either player reachesa hundred points how should they fairlysplit the $40 there are differentnotions of fairness one can use forexample they could split it evenly orthe person with more points can take itall but here's a suggestion what is eachplayer's expected winnings based ontheir current scores that is probabilityof winning check out the link in thedescription for more informationPascal's contributions to probabilitytheory were diverse many of his resultslike the correspondence with Verma arealeatory meaning related to chance ordice or luck these are likely the kindof calculations you would expect to doin an introductory probability coursebut Pascal fought much more broadly thefamous Pascal's wager utilizes a verydifferent notion of probable one that'sepistemic about the certainty oruncertainty of our knowledge Pascal waswagering or betting on the existence ofGod and he did a calculation of sorts inmaking this bet if he believes in Godand God does exist he reaps infiniterewards but if God doesn't exist ithasn't cost him very much to believe inGod he doesn't lose much by having afalse belieftherefore he included it's rational towager that God does exist there are alot of different notions of probabilityand in the 17th century thinkers likePascal were working to formalize all ofthem with varying degrees of successover the next few hundred yearscalculations of probability began toaccumulate but unlike other fields ofmathematics the developing ideas ofprobability theory didn't all arise fromthe same foundation the definitions andtechniques being used were somewhatscattered or ad-hoc the theory ofprobability as a mathematical disciplinecan and should be developed from axiomsin exactly the same way as geometry andalgebra this means that after we havedefined the elements to be studied andtheir basic relations all furtherexposition must be based exclusively onthese axioms independent of the usualconcrete meaning of theelements and their relations that quoteis from Andrey Kolmogorov 1933 textbookfoundations of the theory of probabilitywhich essentially achieved exactly whathe's asking for a rigorous axiomaticbasis for mathematical probabilityhere's an approximate analogy inAmerican English the word square canreference a two-dimensional shape withfour corners a three-dimensional shapewith some right angles any number ofapproximations to these shapes a numberthat can be written as x squared like 9or 16 a tool that's used to computeright angles a solid hearty meal or aboring and old-fashioned person andthat's just a noun form but when you'reactually studying the properties of asquare none of that's relevant theproperties of an abstract square arejust the consequences of the geometricaxioms basically Euclid's axioms thatgovern a square it's important thatEuclid's axioms are motivated by ourintuitive understanding of geometry andwe use that intuition when we'rereasoning mathematically but it's justas important for the rigor ofmathematics to be able to appeal to astrict logical foundation how exactlydid Kolmogorov axiom attach ormathematize probability using a Vennrecently developed branch of math knownas measure theory a measure is aformalized mathematical notion of sizeit takes our intuitions about lengthsarea and volume and generalizes themprobability comes in two flavorsdiscrete questions like how likely is apair of dice to show nine and continuouslike questions about a dartboardKomal Gaurav established a basis forprobability theory using measures whichgrounds both the discrete and continuouscases let's explore this concept in avery literal case you're throwing a dartat this dart board and your dart isinfinitesimally small meaning it hits atexactly a point for mathematicalconvenience we've made the radius of thedart board one over the square root ofpi so that the area is 1/4 now let'spretend you're really bad at darts andthe dart is equally likely to land anyon the board you're basically throwingblindfolded and we only count the dartsthat actually land on the board what'sthe probability you hit this section ofthe dartboard one half why the area theentire dartboard is one in the area ofthis section is one half the probabilityis the fraction of the total area what'sthe probability you hit this section onequarter what about this section it'sstill just the fraction of the totalarea which in this case is also onequarter what's the probability ofhitting the point 1/2 1/2 zero becausethe area of a single point is zerothere's something seemingly paradoxicalabout this it's entirely possible to hitthe point 1/2 1/2 but the probability ofdoing so is zero saying something haszero probability does not imply it'simpossible for every point on thedartboard the probability that the dartlands there is zero but the dart musthit some point in fact even a countablecollection of points on the dart boardhas area zero so the probability you hita point with rational coordinates iszero in the previous example you werethrowing wildly at the dart boardequally likely to hit each point that'scalled a uniform measure the area isuniform across the dart board with theuniform measure the probabilityassociated with each region is the areaof the region divided by the area of theentire dart boardit's normalizing which is why there's nouniform measure on the entire realnumber line but of course your throwsaren't uniform with practice you have ahigher probability of hitting closer towhere you aim let's say you always aimfor the center a quarter of the timeyour dart lands inside this section anda quarter of the time your dart lands inthis section it lands in the outerregions the other half of the timeinstead of thinking about this asdifferent probabilities on the same dartboard we can modify the way we thinkabout the area of the dart board we usea different measure our way of viewingarea but more heavily weightof the dartboard make the inside partwhere it's more likely the land biggernow if I throw a dart blindly at thisdart board I have the same probabilityof hitting each of the colored regionsas you do when you throw a dart at theoriginal dart board the more youpractice it darts the more you'reliterally growing from a probabilistsperspective the center of the dart boardif we want to mathematically study yourdart skills calculate average throws theprobability of hitting the center ringtwice in a rowetc we can just study someone throwing adart blindly at this start board that'show the math of probability is laid outprobabilities are reflected by largerand smaller areas in this example thepoints from each dart throw is a randomvariable with some prescribedprobabilities it will return a specificvalue a hundred if it hits the center 50for the next ring and zero on theoutside ring random variables arecoarse-grained there's a limited amountof information they can give you in thiscase it's the value of the Ring it landsin the random variable doesn't tell youexactly where it is in the ring just thevalue como Gaurav realized that you cando this with everything every purelymathematical question about probabilitycan be phrased in terms of a questionabout sizes that is about measure themodern paradigm of mathematicalprobability is rooted in measured theorythat's the axiomatic structure fromwhich the theory of probability answersquestions there are many differentintellectual inquiries that appeal tothe probabilistic like whether it'srational to bet on God's existence howmany other intelligent beings exist inthe universe and whether a defendant isguilty or innocent these questions canand should be approached scientificallyphilosophically and rationally many ofthese questions can be formulated anddiscussed mathematically using the ideasgrounded in measure theory part of whatI personally love about probability isthe connections between the mathematicalideas of probableand our scientific and philosophicefforts to understand a world filledwith randomness and unknowns what's yourfavorite aspect of

your first purchase thanks for allthe great comments about our episode onstructural balance just choix brought upsome really good points that I wanted toshare with you guys so the first pointwas that this can happen on a graph withany number of people we use six people alot and they broke into two groups ofthree but that doesn't have to be thecase the two groups can be differentsizes they could be five and one you canalso do this on a graph with ten peopleor a hundred people that's all fineanother point that they brought up wasthat often in real life you have a sortof ambivalence toward somebody elseyou're neither friends nor enemies andso maybe it would make more sense tohave three types of edges friendsenemies and neither and that's truethat's a good point that would modelreal life better but it would also makethe graph more complicated it would makethe mathematical model more complicatedwe could study that but we would bestudying a different model and then alsoon the lines of different models theypointed out that often feelings aren'treciprocal one person can be friendswith another who thinks that person istheir enemy people don't always have thesame feeling about each other and sothat could be modeled with a directedgraph which means that there's an arrowpointing in each direction on the edgesso someone can be friends with someoneelse while that person thinks they'reenemies so that would just be adifferent model a different way to studyand it would havedifferent results there were a ton ofgreat responses to our challenge and alot of really great proof of what canhappen if you have a weekly structurallybalanced complete graph a lot of youshowed that their graph still has tosplit into factions but it can have morethan two factions so every vertex couldbe its very own group or they could allbe one group doesn't have to just be twoso of all the great proofs we wanted tosay that our challenge winner is zoutaka this week so congratulations andfinally we wanted to ask something ofyou guys you often have really wonderfulideas about mathematics and things thatyou want to learn more about so ifthere's a topic you're particularlycurious about and you would like to hearabout on a future episode of infiniteseries email us at PBS infinite seriesat gmail.com with the subject linestopic all right see you next week
