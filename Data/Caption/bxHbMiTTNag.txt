hi this is pressed Hawker can you solvethis deceptively difficult geometryproblem consider a rectangle R that'smade up of many smaller rectangles andeach of these small rectangles haseither an integer width or an integerheight or possibly both your job is toprove the large rectangle R also hasthis property that the large rectanglealso has either an integer width or aninteger height or possibly both givethis puzzle a try and when you're readykeep watching the video for the solutionin the video description I provided alink to 14 different ways that you cansolve this problem some which actuallyinvolve some pretty advanced mathematicsin this video I'm going to present oneof the proofs which is the checkerboardproof imagine a checkerboardthat's tiled with light and dark squaresalternately each tile has a height andwidth of 1/2 that means two tilestogether will make an integer height oran integer width now I'm going to drawgrid lines for that so the first step ofthe proof is to show that a rectanglewith integer width covers equal areas oflight and dark squares so imagine arectangle that has an integer widthbecause it has integer width it's goingto line up perfectly with two of thevertical lines because it has that youcan see that they're an equal number ofcolumns that start with the light squareas there are let's start with the darksquare so you can pair up the areas oftwo columns together and you can seethat the entire rectangle is going tocover an equal area of light and darksquares furthermore this property isgoing to hold even if you translate thisacross you can see on the far leftthere's a column which is kind of brokenstarts with a dark square but that'sgoing to exactly compensate for the veryfar right column that starts with a darkSquare and so you can pair up thecolumns again and you're going to seethis rectanglecovers an equal amount of light and darksquares and by extension this is goingto hold true even if I translate itvertically the next step in the proof isto show that a rectangle with integerheightsimilarly covers equal areas of light indark squares it's a very similar proof arectangle with integer height is goingto line up exactly with two of thehorizontal lines so you can see that therows are going to have an equal numberthat start with the light or a darksquare and therefore you can pair up theareas and once again this is going tohold true even if you translate thisrectangle up you're going to see itcovers an equal amount of light and darksquares and even if you shift it to theright you're going to see there's anequal amount that this rectangle coversof light and dark squares now forcompleteness we need to show that therectangle without integer height orinteger width is not going to coverequal areas of light or dark squares sothis is a little slightly morecomplicated step of the proof but let metry and explain it so let's say you havea rectangle with has which has a widthof a and a height of B and neither areinteger lengths so if I place thisrectangle on a grid it's not going toline up with any of the vertical orhorizontal lines where it will line upis we're going to round the number adown we'll call this the floor of a thisis rounding the number a down and it'llline up by rounding the height B down tothe floor of B so we have placed thisrectangle and we divide it up into fourdifferent sections on your checkerboardnow this lower left quadrant has a widthof floor of a and a height of floor of Bso that's an integer width and aninteger height so this region clearlycovers equal areas of light and darksquares if we look at the region rightabove that this region will have a widththat it's equal to the floor of a sothat's an integer with so this regionalso covers equal amounts of light anddark squares the third region has aheight that's equal toFlor of B the floor of B is an integerheight so this region also covers equalamounts of light and dark tours where werun into trouble is that very finalquadrant this has neither an integerwith nor an integer height and there'sno way we're going to be able to coverequal amounts of light and dark squaresso because this one little area doesn'tcover equal amounts of light and darksquares this entire rectangle does notcover equal amounts of light and darksquares so what we proven is that arectangle covers equal areas of lightand dark scores if and only if at leastone side is an integer length so let'sput all that together here's acheckerboard and we want to provesomething about our original rectangle Rso we don't know that this rectangle isgoing to line up exactly along one ofthe grid lines but we do know is thateach of its smaller rectangles righteach of these smaller tiles that make upthat large rectangle we know each onehas an integer width or an integerheight so each one of these is going tocover equal areas of light and darksquares so as we fill in the entirerectangle by these smaller rectangles wethen end up that since each smallrectangle covers equal areas of lightand dark squares therefore the entirelarge rectangle covers equal areas oflight and dark squares which means thatat least one of its sides is an integerand therefore the rectangle R has atleast one side that's an integer lengthdid you figure it out thanks forwatching this video please subscribe tomy channel I make videos on math
