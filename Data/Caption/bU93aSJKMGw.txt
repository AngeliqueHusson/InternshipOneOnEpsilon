okay so welcome to my video on normaldistribution and throughout manyproblems in your textbook but you'regoing to see a set of numbers bedescribed as normally distributed andwhat this means is that the set ofnumbers is balanced they're not heavilyskewed to the left they're not heavilyskewed to the right now the set ofnumbers is normally distributed and thereason why it's so important to describea set of numbers as normally distributedis we could use this normal curve orthis bell-shaped curve to describe theset of data anytime the numbers arenormally distributed and this curve is avery powerful tool that allows us to dothings such as predictive chance ofsomething happening it also just givesus a better idea of what the data reallylooks like so this this bell-shapedcurve is a very powerful term that toolthat you're going to use throughout yourcourse so let's get started right awaywith an example and this will make a lotmore sense okay so here in this problemit says that the test scores for classare normally distributed okay this needsto be given to us they need to tell usthat it's normally distributed or youneed to make a safe assumption that thedata isn't it is in fact normallydistributed okay so now we know thatit's normally distributed and so we candraw this normal curve and it also saysin this problem that the the averagetest score for the class is 75 okay soI'm going to write that down with theGreek letter nu this is the average theaverage is equal to 75 and it also saysthat the standard deviation is equal to10 the standard deviation for apopulation is written with the Greekletter Sigma so our standard deviationis equal to 10 and this problem isasking us to draw the data on no more onthe normal curve okay and the firstthing you're going to do is you're goingto draw or you're going to put theaverage which is 75 directly in themiddle of the curve okay so we're goingto go to the middle of thecurve and we're going to put our averageof 75 directly in the middle in thisdistance between one line and anotherline is equal to one standard deviationso if we go to the right of the averageone standard deviation we need to addone standard deviation which is 10 so weneed to add our standard deviation of 1075 plus 10 is equal to 85 so our valueunder this line is equal to 85 and sothe same concept applies if we go overone other line this is also a distanceof one standard deviation so we need toadd another 10 so 85 plus 10 is equal to95 and the same concept applies if yougo to the left of the average butinstead of adding one standard deviationyou just subtract so if we're going tothe left of the average one standarddeviation we need to subtract teninstead of adding ten 75 minus ten isequal to 65 and if we go over anotherstandard deviation we need to subtractanother 10 65 minus 10 is equal to 55okay so now let's take a look at thearea underneath the curve the areaunderneath the curve actually gives us alot of information the area under thecurve tells us the probability of astudent's testscore notice how half ofthe area is greater than the average of75 so that means half is equal to 50%that means that there's a 50% chancethat a students score is greater than 75and also notice how half of the areaunder the curve is less than the averageso that means that there is a 50% chancehalf there's a 50% chance that thestudents score is below 75 so thisnormal curve is a very powerful tool forpredicting the probability of a studentstest score um so now let's talk aboutthe empirical rule the empirical rulegives us the area in between onestandard deviation and two standarddeviations and and three standarddeviations okay so what exactly is theempirical rule the empirical rule statesthat 68% of the data falls within onestandard deviation okay so we know fromthe empirical rule that 68% of the datafalls within one standard deviationabove the average and one standarddeviation below the average and sincesince this curve is perfectlysymmetrical we know that this area isexactly half of this area to the left soif we take half of 68% and we know thatthis area to the right of the averageand one standard deviation is 34% and weknow the area to the left of the averageand one standard deviation is also 34%thirty-four percent plus 34% gives usour sixty-eight percent we also knowfrom the empirical rule that 95% of thedata falls within two standarddeviations so we know that this areaunderneath the first standard deviationand the second standard deviation mustequal 13.5 percent this is because if weadd 13.5% with 34% with 34% with another13.5 percent if we add all thosetogether that gives us 95% so we knowfrom the empirical rule that 95% of thedata is between two standard deviationsor 95% of the area under the curve isbetween two standard deviationsokay so we've already described 95% ofthe curve and there's only 5% left sothese two spaces are only 5%the curve and like I said before theyare this curve is perfectly symmetricalso we can divide five percent in half toget each of the percent for the forthese areas so we know that one side istwo-and-a-half percent and the otherside is also two and half percent whichgives us the remaining five percent ofthe curve okay so now we labeled theentire curve and now I want to show youhow you can use this curve and show youhow powerful it is in predicting theprobability of a of a student's scoreokay you can use this curve to predictthe score of all the students thatscored below and 95 in order to do thatyou just need to find the area below 95and I just coloring that in for youright now okay so let's add all thoseareas together the probability of astudent scoring below 95 is equal to allof the areas below 95 on the curve so wehave 13.5 percent we have 34 percent wealso have another 34 percent I'llcontinue below you also have another13.5 percent and we also have two and ahalf percent and if we add all of thoseareas together we get the probability ofa a student scoring below ninety five isequal to ninety seven point five percentokay so now I hope you're getting a goodidea of how powerful this curve reallyis you can really predict any anystudents test score so let's do it onemore time let's find the probabilitythat a student's testscore is between 55and 65 okay so the only thing that weneed to do to find this probability isfind the areabetween 55 and 65 the area between 55and 65 is 13.5 percent of the total areaof the curve so we know the probabilityof a student scoring between 55 and 65is also going to be 13.5 percent okay soI hope this gave you a better idea ofwhat normal distribution is what thenormal curve is and what the empiricalrule is and my next video is going to bevery similar to this one but instead ofusing standard deviation we're going touse z-scores which are almost identicalto two standard deviations so so youshouldn't have any trouble in my nextvideo and I really hope that that you'rereally enjoying these and that they'reeasy to follow and I will see you in mynext one
