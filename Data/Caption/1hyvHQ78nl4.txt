what I want you to do is let's say I'mgiving cosine of five over seven theonly thing I should know about kosheringright right now for this problem is youknow that cosine by using sohcahtoa isyour adjacent over your hypothesis rightso if you kind of like kind offorgetting and you're given a cosine weknow that we can at least write atriangle for this say let's say that'stheta that's my right name so if myhypotenuse is seven my Jason side isgoing to be adjacent sides gonna be fivetherefore I don't know what assets do Iknow or we could call a or B whateveryou want to use but now again going backwell theta or a reserve or anything butI'll leave this one is X so if you guysremember we're gonna have to use thethank our zero so a squared plus Bsquared equals C squared right well thisterm I'm not going to use a and Bsquared we can use X so anyways I'lljust use five squared plus x squaredit's not want to use B I'm gonna use xequals seven squared Y squared is 25plus x squared equals 49subtract 25 x squared is going to equal24 then I have to take the square root Xis going to equal the square root of 24it can't be negative because not so youcan't have a negative distance correctso she's giving me positive squared andthen get 20k yes then I'll see can yousimplify though that radical do youprobably wouldn't want to do that so wesay what the group number goes intothere 2 4 6 would be 2 root of 6 allright so now it asks us to find the sixtrigonometric functions well we alreadygo sign they are two gave us so if Iknow let's just do this sine is oppositeover hypotenuseyeahcosine a bit up equals five over seventangent of theta is going to be youropposite over your adjacent right soit's 2 root 6 over 5 ok next one let'sdo the reciprocal functions so eitherI'll have cosecant cosecant of theta isgoing to equal is we're gonna have soit's going to be your hypotenuse overyour opposite so to be 7th over it'sjust that one flipped over to root 6well here I'm gonna have to rationalizethe denominator so I'm gonna want tomultiply by root 6 on the top so what Iget here is going to be 7 times root 6over 6 times root 6 times root 6 s 6 6times 2 is 12all right here we're gonna have the samething for secant but now it's gonna be 5over 2 root 6so again I need to rationalize thedenominator by multiplying my trouthe ontop and bottom so here I'm going to math5 root 6and last one would be hot or as we callit a math cotangent so the cotangent isgoing to be rotated here is wrong noopposite over just not right I think youmight see Kayla my secant is seven overmy coat stick at 7:05that's cotangent look at look at cosineright so secant is that just flippedover seven or five Clement cotangent isthis flipped over 5 over 2 root six Ihave missed myself in there so that'show you find the six trig propertiesthey might make questions on thatespecially if you're looking on yourphone you're not looking up here yepgive me a custom stop okay what is ityou know like 30 degrees that double itjust if it doesn't give you the angleand just gives you likethat no-mates that kind potenuse or soyou just use those right you don't haveto worry about 30 degrees 45 degrees nowyeah for this one if it gives you likean angle 5/7 you have to create a righttriangle that's not funny I do this
