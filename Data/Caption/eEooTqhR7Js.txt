let us analyze a construction of theperpendicular bisector of a line segmentwe fix the length of the compass alittle more than half the length of a bekept it on pointa and made an arc above and below a Bwith the same compass length we keep thecompass on point B and make two arcswhich intersect the previous two arcslet's call this point B why do we saythat this line is the perpendicularbisector of segment a B let's call thesepoints C and D let's join AC BC ad andBD there are two things we need to provefirst ap is equal to BP and second thisangle is a right angle if we are able toprove these two things we can say thatline CD is the perpendicular bisectorthe first thing we should know is thatall these four lengths are equal becausethe compass width was unchanged look attriangle C a B and triangle da B theyare special in two ways first both areisosceles it means that the pair of baseangles in both triangles are congruentand second both are congruent by thetriple-s condition side side and side soangle C a B will be congruent to angle Da B as their corresponding angles ofcongruent triangles an angle CBA iscongruent to angle DBA as they arecorresponding angles - this means thatall these four angles are congruent nowlook at triangle C ad and CBD in asimilar way they are isosceles andcongruent by the triple-s condition itmeans these four angles will becongruent in the final step look atthese four triangles CA p CB p d AP andDB pall these four triangles are congruentby the a si condition take these twotriangles for instance a s a considerthese two triangles now a s a as thesetwo triangles are congruent ap willequal B P as their corresponding sidesand these four angles are congruent asall the four triangles are congruent allfour together add up to 360 degrees soeach one has to be 90 degrees and thatis why we can say that this line is aperpendicular bisector of segment a Byou
