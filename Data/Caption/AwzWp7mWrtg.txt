okay in this video I want to talk abouthow to derive the formula for interestcompounded annually and okay maybe we'lluse specific numbers to get going andthen we'll try to generalize from thatso I'm going to continue for my lastexample suppose you walk into a bank andyou deposit ten thousand dollars soagain that $10,000 is what's what'scalled our principle or principle andwe'll denote that with a capital Psuppose we get a rate or our APR ofwhatever it is will denote the rate APRthat's what we'll denote that as so letme maybe put that in red so the ratewe'll call that we'll label at the APRthe annual percentage rate notice okayso suppose we get an AP R in this caseof 6% and we want to calculate how muchmoney we would have if this iscompounded annually okay so compoundedannuallykind of a key thing to recognize to theformula is that if you take yourstarting principle okay so if I take mystarting principle and I multiply thatby one plus whatever the APR is as adecimal that's gonna give me the amountthe total amount at the end of that yearokay so that's going to be one key thinghere so again in this case at the end ofyear one so at the end of year one mystarting principle was ten thousand Imultiply that by one plus the APR andagain the APR as a decimal would bepoint zero six so it says I need tomultiply ten thousand by one point zerosix and we got the the number for thatin the other video we showed that thatwas ten thousand six hundred dollarsokay so at the end of year oneat the end of year one notice I wouldhave my starting principal and I'vemultiplied that by the number one pointzero six okay whatever that equals andagain I'm not going to multiply it outbecause I think it'll help us to spotthe pattern okay so that means at theend of year two how much money would wehave well we've got the money that Iearned at the the the the total amountof money from the end of year one onewell from year one I've got ten thousandtimes one point zero six dollars well sothis is the amount so this is from thisisat the end of year oneagain we didn't multiply it out but wehave to do to get the new amount again Iwould have to multiply this by another1.06 and remember we can rewrite thisnow I've got one point zero six timesone point zero six so we can simplyrewrite this more compactly as tenthousand times one point zero six to thesecond power okayand likewise at the end of year threewhat's gonna happen we're gonna have totake our amount from the previous yearwhich again is now ten thousand onepoint zero six squared so that's thebalance from the end of year two and howwould we get the balance at the end ofyear three well since we're compoundingannually we would have to multiply thisvalue by yet another one point zero sixwell if I multiply again by another onepoint zero six now I'm gonna have mystarting principal times one point zerosix this time raised to the third powerso I think maybe you can probably guesswhat would happen at the next one at theend of year four I would get tenthousand times one point zero six to thefourth power at the end of year five whowould turn into the fifth power at theend of your six it would be the sixthpower etc so maybe we can kind ofextrapolate from that what a niceformula would be okay soI'll leave this one up here is kind of areminder but to me it looks like theamount accumulated a so that's what awill stand forokay the accumulated amount accumulatedto a l zq mutilated I think one L thatlooks better it's gonna be the amountaccumulated okay so how did we get theamount accumulated okay again this againrepresents the amount accumulated to meit looks like we've always got ourstarting principal okay then it lookslike we're multiplying it by this numberone point zero six well how did we getone point zero six we took one plus weadded on our APR as a decimal and thenit looks like if we want to know theamount accumulated after Y years so tome it looks likeremember we said after three years theexponents gonna be three after fouryears the exponent will be four so to meit looks like the total amountaccumulated after Y years would be wewould have to put a Y up here so let meuse a capital y so it says this isrepresents the formula that would beaccumulated after Y years if interest iscompounded annuallyat a rate of a PR okay again that's whatwe're denote the rate as so now we'vegot a nice little derivation of ourcompound interest formula again thisonly works if your compounding interestannually but it's still a good littleformula to have so I hope this videomakes some sensewhat I want to talk about in my nextvideo is what happens if interest isn'tcompounded annually what if we do it youknow what if we do it why do we all haveto do it once a year what if we do ittwice a year or three times a year or 12times a year monthly or maybe we do itdaily why not why stop there maybe I doit every minute every second everymillisecond so we can compound as oftenas we want but things are going tochange a little bit and I definitelywant to talk about that so again if youhave any questions feel free to postcomments hopefully me or somebody elsecan help you and I hope this helps
