Well, I'm a mathematician and I like YouTube and I'm often inspired by stuff that I see on Youtube andrecently I saw two clips thatGave me an idea. I just want to tell you about thisImpressive, I'm sure they don't do anything else, but march that's the main occupation, rightThis is impressive, but what I found even more impressive wassome Japanese people competing in a marching competitionSo here we goNow that's really impressiveAnyway, so I had this ideaIt's basically squares marching around obviously as a mathematician. I like squares. I like circles, I like all sorts of these things, so I thought well, maybeWhat I want to do is... I had this ideaIf you had two (identical) squares kind of marching around and what I wanted to do is kind ofdevise some sort of choreography for these two squaresmerging into one big huge square, and so you can imagine the two squares kind of marching around there.And then eventually they they kind of come together and whoops you see like one big square marching, okay?It's a good idea, so let's let's see whether we can do this.Okay, first thing we have to figure out is how big do we want to make our squares, okay?So we could start with really really small ones likeSo 2 by 2, is that going to work?Let's have a look right. So we've got four marches and here another four marches in there. It's a total of eight marchesBut we need a square number of marchers, right?So that's not going to work all right so we can't really go really small. What about the next size up three?Times three and three times three so that's nine here, and that's nine there. That is together 18. Againthat's not a square number, so it's not going to work. Let's keep on going16 + 16 that's 32 not a square number, okay, then25 Plus 25That's 50It's actually pretty close49 [so] [it's] just one off soWell anyway, let's keep searching.So eventually we got to find something hopefully already pretty close here on let's use thisIt's actually not going to work, but eventually is going to work, and I just want something smallIt's a near miss. All right, so this is 12 squared. This is 12 squared - 12 squared is 144Times 2 is a288 and that 17 squared is 289. So it's also just one off. All right, and it's good enough to actually show usWhat's going to happen okay? So now let's not worry about actually finding the right exampleLet's just keep on going with our choreography.How we're going to actually merge those two squares together, okay?And also the other thing that I want to say since I'm having so much trouble  finding these squaresI'm going to use the smallest example eventually. It's going to be important for later on okay.So this let's just say this is the smallest example that exists okay, and so now we're going to do our choreography.We're going to merge those two squares together. So here we go. We're going to march these squares aroundokay, andthese are actually theGuys who are marching and this is kind of just the template for us to see where they now actually have to go.Eventually these these blue dots have to fit into this grid hereOkay what we're going to do is just march these two squares in from the left and the right okay like thatAnd they're going to overlap here in the middle. It's a bit of a problemMaybe but not really you just have some marchers stand on their comrades' shoulders, right?So here we basically all double up, where the red points are all doubled up, right?OkaySo what that means is in the square that we're seeing here [there] [is] nobody standing hereThere's just one person standing in the blue bits and on every one of the red bitsThere's two people  doubled up right? So if I just take the guys who are standing on the shouldersThey should nowFit into thoseEmpty squares right because eventually you know whatever we had to start with is supposed to fill in all the spots, right?So what that means of course is that this red Square is?Exactly as big as those two little onesCombined together right. So that's a logical conclusion right, so this one plus that one equals that one.Okay, well that's great. But there's something really really really strange here, hmm...rememberWe started out with saying this is the smallest example where two [identical] smaller squares combine into a larger squareBut now we found even smaller onesHow is that possible that's supposed to be the smallest example and now we found an even smaller one?HmmWell, you can think about it, but actually the only way you can resolve thisParadox is to say well there is no smallest example because if there is a smallest exampleThere can't be any smaller example. We basically start with an assumption that we can find the smallest example, butthat shows us, this kind of paradox this contradiction shows us. there can't be a smallest example.So there is actually no way to merge two [identical] squares into a larger squareSo that's what we're just shown it's actually in mathematics is called a proof by contradictionYou assume that something is the case okay?And then you make logical deductions until you come to a point where you can see there's some nonsense hereBut from something that's trueNonsense can't follow so that means that what you started with has to be [nonsense] in the first place and it means thatwhatever is the opposite of what you assumed has to be true. in this case two [identical] squares cannot possibly combine two a larger square[alright], so we can also express this mathematicallyor algebraically. Two integer squares can't add up to another integer square like thatand then we can transform this a little bit, soTwo times m squared is equal to n squared doesn't work andthen if you divide here that one can't work and now if you do a square root you see that one can't work andwhat that says here is that the square root of 2 cannot be written as afraction as a fraction of integers and what that says is that square root of 2 is irrational so actually our marching square scenarioour marching square consideration also show that the square root of two is irrational¡ÝAll right now. What else can we say here?Okay, this was actually the near-miss example that I used okay.So it was 12 squared plus 12 squared equals 17 squared minus 1well, IMean I just use this for illustration, but actually when you when you really do itAnd I'm just going to do it again in a nice symmetric wayThere's something nice coming out of this and I just want to show you that one, okay, so just kind of March these squares inNow this way, and then we get the same overlap as before all rightOkay, and then actuallyBecause we started out with a near-MissI mean if this was exact then the green bit should be exactly as big as as these two combine togetherBut since we started with a near-miss. Well, we should be closed again. We should [be] close again. We can actually check nowWe've got one two three four five and herewe've got one two three four five six seven that's the other near-miss that we kind of encountered already at the very very beginning andthat's5 square plus 5 squared equals seven squared plus one okay, and why stop there all right?So we can just move those two guys into the middle now, and they're going to create an overlapLet's just see what we get here. Well. We've got a two squared there with our two squaredThat's eight and just [off] by one from nine. So that's another near miss here. All right, so we get another near miss there andWhat what else we don't have to stop there?It's a really simple one, but it's still a near-miss 1 squared plus 1 squared equals 1 squared plus 1 okay?right so so with one one of those near misses we kind ofYou know get all all sorts of other near misses when we kind of repeat this merging procedure. It's really really quite funAnd actually get all of the smaller ones, but we can also kind of go backwards, and when we go backwards from herewe actually get all the near misses that there are [okay], so let's just go backwards, so[kind] of go like thisso unmerge right then we put the square aroundunmergethat gets us back to the beginning now[if] we want the next higher or the next bigger near-miss what we do is we just put a big square around thislike soMeasure how wide this is then there's another square inside. Measure, how far this is and we get29 Squared plus 29 squared equals 41 squared plus 1 andThen you take those two squares again arrange them like this put a big square around it and we get anotherexample and another example and another example, and it's actually going to be allexamples of two squaresAdding up to another squarewith the difference of just oneokay, and here are a couple of our examples. There is moreThere's  heaps more here on the left side andWell those near missesThey are also really nice in another way, so let's for example look here, it was 1/1, 3/27/5 if you just actually look at them as fractions you get a 1 here you get a 1.5 there you get a1.4 there andThat one here and what do you think is happening here?well, they're getting closer and closer to square root of 2AndEspecially this one, these are actually really really niceapproximations really really good approximations to the square root of 2So I mean people always obsess about Pi and like one of the things you know about piIs that 22 over 7 is almost pi right?so if you're actually looking for afraction that you know does the same for square of 2 you'd probably go for this one here nobody knows this oneBut 17 over 12 plays the same role for square root of 2 as 22 over 7 plays for pi
