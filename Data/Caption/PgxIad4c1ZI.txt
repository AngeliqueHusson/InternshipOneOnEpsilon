hi this is Mario with Mario's mathtutoring coming to you with another mathvideo to help you boost your score inyour math class improve yourunderstanding and hopefully make mathmore fun and less stressful so in thisvideo what we're going to talk about ishow to find the volume of prisms andcylinders okay so what is a prism okayand what is a cylinderwell prism is basically a threedimensional object okay where you've gottwo bases okay that are the same sizeand shape okaythey're so they're congruent and they'reparallel meaning if they were to keepgoing they're not going to cross sothey're parallel congruent basesseparated by the height okay so that'swhat a prism is cylinder is basicallythe exact same thing okay it looks likea can of some sort you can almost thinkof it as a circular prism the top andbottom are circles okay and it'sseparated by the height okay and the twocircles are parallel and congruent sothe formulas really easy it's the areaof the base times the height so thecapital B means the area of the base sonot the length of the base but theactual two-dimensional area times theheight so what you could think of is youcould think of this as a triangle andyou're stacking up these triangles ontop of one another until you get athree-dimensional object so it's like asticky notes you know a notepad youstack them up that gives you the thirddimension that gives you the volumethree-d right okay so if we find themlet's look at this example if we findthe volume of this triangular prism okaynow notice the the dots here the dashesthat just means that we're lookingthrough the object to the other side sothat we can kind of get that sense of 3don a flat surface okay but let's go andfind the volume on this one it's thearea of the base times the height nowwhat I like to do is I like to writedown the formula and you might want todo the same thing too but then what wecan do is we can subdivide the formulaso the area of the base that's atriangle what's the formula for area ofa triangle it's one half base timesheight times the height again okay solet's not get confused there's a lot ofbees have a lot of H's right so the thecapital B means the area of this basethe area of this triangle the little Bmeans the length of the base so the basehere in this triangle is either three orfour okay three could be the base andfour could be the height of the trianglekind of like thissee three and four okay and then theheight okay the overall prison is theten that's what's separating the twotriangles that you parallel congruentbases so if we put these values in wehave one half three times four and thenthe overall height is ten if we multiplyall those together we get 3 times 4 is12 times 10 is 120 times 1/2 or dividedby 2 is going to give you 60 units cubedso cubed means we're filling this upwith like little ice cubes you know soto speak like that how many of thoselittle cubes would fill up the inside ofthis container ok the next example we'regoing to talk about the volume of acylinder now I just want to say ifyou're enjoying these videos go aheadand subscribe to the channel and I'vegot more videos like this coming for youand you can take a check out some of mypast videos but let's look at this lastexample cylinder ok same idea we'regoing to find the volume so it's thearea of the base times the height thebases of circle what's the formula forarea of a circle it's PI R squared rightso and then times the height so theoverall height we know is 10 we knowwhat pi is a 3.14 and then the radius isthe distance from the center of thecircle to a point on the circle so theygive us that that's 4 4 squared soremember you want to do the order ofoperations parentheses exponentsmultiplication right so 4 squared is 16times 10 is 160 and we'll just leavepius pi so that'll give us an exactanswer 160 PI units cubed we're fillingthis up with like little ice cubes isthis glass okayso again I hope you're enjoying thevideos go ahead and comment below andlet me know what you liked about thevideos and maybe what I could do betterto improve the videos and I look forwardto seeing you in the futurefuture videos I'll talk to you soon
