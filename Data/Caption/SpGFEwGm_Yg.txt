two fat guys are thrown together what isthe probability of getting a sum of sixwe know that we have 36 possibleoutcomes when two dice are rolled ofcourse we can't write all of them downso we need to think of differentpossibilities that give us a sum of sixso we make two columns for both the diced1 and d2 remember we can get numbersonly from 1 to 6 on the dice sum of 1 &5 can give us 6 that is we get a 1 ondice 1 and a 5 on dice 2 this gives us 2possibilities 1 & 5 & 5 & 1remember 5 on D 1 and 1 on D 2 isdifferent from 1 on D 1 & 5 on D 2 eachof these pairs add up to 6weight sum of 2 & 4 also gives us 6again that will give us 2 possibilities2 & 4 & 4 & 2 any other possibilitiesyes a 3 & a 3each of these pairs add up to 6 so inall there are 5 possibilities which giveus a sum of 6 and in all we have 36total outcomes so the probability ofgetting a sum of 6 and the throw of twodice will equal 5 by 36 these 5possibilities out of a total 36 in thisexample we just have to think of allpossibilities that give us a sum of 6but will this technique of thinking ofdifferent possibilities always worklet's see a similar problem when twodice are thrown what is the probabilityof getting a sum greater than 3 we willlook at the solution in the next videomeanwhile why don't you try using thesame technique to get the probability ofrolling a sum greater than 3 think ofall the possibilities and divided by 36you
