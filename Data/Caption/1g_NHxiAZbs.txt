all right so late in German the nextthing we're going to talk about is wecreated triangles a lot sometimes we'llbe using triangles Mackenzie as angle ofelevation or angle of depression or thenext thing we might say is we might uselike kind of some directions for yousaying and directions are very common innavigation alright and one of the waysthat we call them directions is whatwe'll use is bearings all right if hehas ever been on a you know boat or anairplane or you know kind of racing youmight be familiar a little bit with youknow the use of the bearing knowledge soone thing we're always going to talkabout bearings is remember we alwaysstart with our standard angles rightwe're on the horizontal line that waslike your initial term our initial sideand then we always want counterclockwiseright well our bearings when I'm talkingabout giving you directions usingbearings we're always going to have ourNorth is going to be always up top whichwill be at 0 degrees then you're goingto have East which would be 90 degreesso if I say I'm going at a direction ofa bearing of 45 degrees you guys couldsay that my angle would be like thiswhere that angle is 45 degrees all rightSouth is going to be a hundred andeighty degrees and then west is going tobe 270 degrees all right so I can giveyou directions by what your bearing is Ican just say hey there's a bearing andI'll just tell you what angle it is andthat's where you just find the angle butremember it's a little bit differentall right because remember and whatwe've previously done we always had thisbeing our initial side and we alwayswent counterclockwise right that was tojust graph you know our our angles butnow we're talking about bearings anddirections this is gonna be our skanderform this is a learner what we're gonnabase off of okay next thing there's nota different way we can describe bearingsrather than just kind of giving you anangle we could also sometimes say thiswe could say northsixty degrees west or we could say south15 degrees east so if I give you adirection and a bearing like this whatthat tells you to do is rather than justgive us the initial angle we're going tokind of use our axes to go off of ourangle so this one it says north so whatyou're going to do is you're going toget on north axis and then it says sixtydegrees west so you go to an angle of 60degreessixty degrees west okay so if I give youdirections like that you're going to gonorth first and then sixty degrees tothe west then the last one if I saySouth what you're going to do is go onthe south axis so you're going to go onthe south axis and then go fifteendegrees eastokay so ladies and gentlemen that's howwe're going to use bearings in our workprops
