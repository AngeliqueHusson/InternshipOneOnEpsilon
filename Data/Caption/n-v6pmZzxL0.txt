I think the best way to start this video is with a puzzle,a smaller version of what you perhaps saw in the thumbnail.We'll build up to that one later.Now, start with two nails, or two thumbtacks, that are in a wall.And what I want you to do is hang a picture off of those two nails.And when you do this, you're allowed to loop the wire around the nails in any way that you like,and then tie both loose ends of your string or wire to your picture, and as long as it hangs, you're good.Now, the only stipulation is, if you remove either nail, the picture should fall.So if you remove the first nail while leaving the second alone, the picture should fall.Or if you remove the second nail while leaving the first alone, the picture should fall.I should say this is not a trick question in any way, it is completely possible to do this,and I really want you to actually try it.So find two nails or two thumbtacks that are in a wall,or work it out with pencil and paper if you don't feel like getting up or if that's more your style.Now, surprisingly, there are actually infinitely many answers here that work.I'm gonna share with you the simplest one.So, go around the first nail clockwise,Then go around the second nail also clockwise,Then go back to the first nail and loop around it counterclockwise,then the second nail, again, counterclockwise.And if you do this you'll notice that the picture hangs.But if you remove either the first nail or the second nailThe picture falls down.Now the real question is: How did I know that that would work?And it turns out there is an incredibly beautiful mathematical explanation behind all this.And I am extraordinarily excited to share it with you guys.However, I should say that if you found the two nail version of the problem too easyYou may be excited to hear that there is an arbitrarily many nail version of the problem.So you can imagine putting a million nails in a wall.Then there is some way to loop a string around all one million of these nails so thata picture hangs off of it, but if you remove any one of these nailsThe whole thing collapses and the picture falls down.So if you found the 2 nail version of this problem too easy,maybe you can pause the video and work on that one.In the meantime, however, I will explain to everyone else what is going on here.What I'm going to do is call moving around the first nail clockwise 'a',and moving around the second nail clockwise 'b'.This is just so that I don't have to keep
saying move around the first nailclockwise move around the second now you know whatever over and over and over again.Also I'm going to call moving around the first nail counterclockwise 1/a
or a inverse and similarly moving aroundthe second nail counterclockwise will be
1/b or b inverse.Finally I'm going to call the configuration where I do nothing at all where I don'twrap around any nail and the picture just simply falls down, 1. Why am I doing this wellI'm hoping to create some kind of
analogy between this stuff andmultiplying numbers and it's worth
reiterating that this is just ananalogy. However initially it does kind of
seem to work I mean think about it, ifyou do a followed by 1/a, you get
a 1 and the picture falls down. Similarlyif you do 1/a followed by a, you
get a 1 and the picture falls down andsame thing with the bs you know b
followed by 1/bor 1/b followed by b both give you a 1 and the
picture falls down. So at least initially,our intuition does seem to agree with
our notation which is pretty coolwith our new lingo in place I want to go
back to the solution that I gave to theoriginal problem. So if you remember
first I went around the first nailclockwise so that's an a then around the
second nail clockwise so b then aroundthe first nail counterclockwise so 1/a followed by a 1/b. Now on onelevel it should be clear why this
solution works because if I get rid ofthe first nail that's the same thing as
getting rid of any term involving an aso I'm left with a b times 1/b
which is a 1 and the picture falls down.Similarly if I get rid of the second
nail that's the same thing as gettingrid of all the bs so I'm left with an a
times 1/a which gives a 1 and onceagain the picture falls down so that is
super awesome. However, clearly there issomething fishy going on here because
this does not explain why thisconfiguration allows the picture to hang
in the first placeif this really were like number
multiplication everything would cancelout right at the start and the picture
would not hang at all, but clearly itdoes, so even though this might look like
number multiplication, something is verydifferent and just to give what I'm
talking about a name, numbermultiplication is commutative which
means the order in which you multiplythe numbers does not affect the answer,
but that is not what is going on here.Notice that if you do b a 1/a 1/b, everything cancels just as youwould expect any picture falls down.
However because in my solution I did a b1/a 1/b, I just switched that
order in the beginning, the picture seemsto hang though it seems as though a will
only cancelwith 1/a if they are right next
to each other and b will only cancelwith 1/b also if they are right
next to each other, so what we aredealing with here is clearly very much
not commutative. The order in which I dothings definitely matters. In keeping
with standard mathematical convention,I'm going to stop writing 1/a and 1/b and replace them with a inverseand b inverse, and the reason I'm doing
this in part is just to prevent thattemptation to just cancel the 1/a
wherever I may see them and if yourewrite the original solution of the
problem in this way it becomes a b ainverse b inverse and actually this
little doohickey has a special name inmathematics, it is called the commutator
and commutators are an incrediblyimportant idea in mathematics. Actually,
I'd be remiss not to mention that wehave secretly sort of stepped into the
ubiquitous and vastly importantoverarching branch of mathematics called
group theory. Now obviously I can'treally do justice to group theory in like a 10 minute YouTube video...a decade-long YouTube video would not be
enough um so what I'm going to leave youwith is a: 1, how these ideas come up in
more exciting and interesting contextsother than just, you know looping strings
around nails, and then number 2, I want totalk about what makes this example
particularly interesting, like why thestring around the nail example is
particularly exciting, and the number 3, Iwant to tell you about how to use these
ideas to solve the version of theproblem where you have, I don't know, like
a million nails on the wall.As I mentioned before, if a b were the
same as b a, the commutator would justturn into one.
so the triviality of the commutatorallows you to test whether the order in
which you do a and b matters. Let me giveyou two examples of places where this
comes up that are not very technical. So,take a Rubik's Cube and let's say
rotating this side by 90 degrees is aand rotating this side by 90 degrees is
b, then notice if you do a b that is notthe same as doing b a so you get a
different cube depending on which of aand b you do first and once again this
can also be seen by noticing that doinga b a inverse b inverse, does not return
you to the original cube. Here's one moreexample so take this hexagon, and I want
you to think about all of the rigidmotions you can perform on this hexagon,
so that after you perform them you havethe same outline as you did at the start.
So one example would be rotating by say60 degrees. If you rotate by 60 degrees
then at the end of that rotation youhave the same outline as you did at the
start. Another example would be flippingalong this vertical axis. Say flipping
along this vertical axis is a androtating by 60 degrees is b, then once
again a b is not the same as b a anddoing a b a inverse b inverse does not to
return you to the original hexagon, andof course, depending on your taste, there
are lots of other more advanced placesthat these ideas come up.Now, non commutativity is of course very
interesting and I hope I've convincedyou that it's a widely occurring
phenomenon that is very useful tounderstand, but there's a lot more than
just non commutativity which makes theexample with the string and the nails
particularly interesting, and I'm goingto try and illustrate this to you by
contrasting with the other two examplesthat I showed you before. So if you
remember in the case of the hexagon, Icalled flipping along this axis a and
rotating by 60 degrees b.Now let's say I do a then b then a again then b again.
Notice I return back to the original.Now what's interesting about this is I've
found a way to return back to theoriginal without doing any backtracking,
it's not like I did a and then abackwards to get back to the original, no,
this is definitely more interesting than that.If I were being more systematic
about this if I took the same attitudethat an explorer might have, and I, let's
say I were trying to draw a map let'ssay I start at this location and then
from this location I figure out whatdoing a does and what doing b does, and
then I do the same thing from thislocation I figure out we're doing a does
and then what b does.Notice however that doing a and b from here doesn't actually take me anywhere new, it doesn't bring meto a new state that I haven't been to
already, so doing a takes me back hereand doing b takes me back here, and
similarly doing a from here just takesme back to the original so what I found
in my map is an honest-to-goodness looplike a way to go from one back to one
without doing any backtracking.If I were to finish this map, by the way, this is
what the whole picture would look likeand as you can see there are lots of
loops in it.These maps, as I'm calling them, are
actually called Cayley graphs, if youwant to look them up further. What a
Cayley graph is, is you know, you pick aset of moves that you're interested in
in this case the moves I picked were aand b, and you just draw a map of, you
know, all the places, all the differentstates that your moves can take you, and
in this case this is what that map looks like.You may be interested to hear that
the Cayley graph of a Rubik's Cubehas loops as well, so let's say this is a, this is b, and this is c,then if I do abc abc abc abc,notice that I am back to the
original cube, so this is once again aninteresting way to get back to the
original without any backtracking.Of course, I can't show you the full Cayley
graph of a rubik's cube because thereare 43 quintillion different states that
a rubik's cube can take, which may seemlike a lot until you realize that for
our humble situation with the two nailsand the string looping around it, the
Cayley graph is actually infinite, andwhat's more, there are no loops in it.So let's say this is 1 and these arrowsrepresent a b a inverse and b inverse,
then this is what the Cayley graph looks like,and as you can see it has this
beautiful fractal structure, which allowsus to get a sense of the shape of it
despite its infinite nature and it'samazing to see all of this beautiful
mathematics hidden inside just two nailsand a string. Unfortunately, I can't prove to you that this Cayley graph is correct,the mathematics is beyond the scope of
this video. However, one practicalimplication is that pretty much however
you wrap your string around your nails,the picture is guaranteed to hang. I mean
think about it let's say you did a b a bthen a 7 times then b inverse 12 times
then a 6 more times say, you areguaranteed that you will not have
accidentally made it back to one becausethere are no loops in the Cayley graph.
The only way you could get back to 1 isif you did a bunch of stuff and then you
did the same stuff backwards which wouldof course cause everything to cancel.Let's start with three nails, and just asbefore I'm going to call going around
them clockwise a b and c, and goingaround them counterclockwise is a
inverse b inverse and c inverse.Now the trick here is to shove commutators inside other commutators.What we know is that a b a inverse b inverse
will turn into one if you get rid of theas or the bs, but unfortunately this
combination does not involve any cs, sowhat I'm going to do to rectify this is
replace the b with the commutator of band c, and b inverse with the commutator
of c and b.Why? Well first notice thatthese two commutators are actually
inverses of each other,so when I get rid of the as, they wind
up next to each other and every thingcancels. Also, getting rid of either the
bs or the cs causes these newcommutators to go away, which once
again causes every thing to cancel. So nowwe have a ten move combination that
involves all three nails and it shouldwork, and indeed if you try removing any
of the nails, it actually falls, which Ifind extremely satisfying, and you know
you can keep doing something similar ifyou want to increase the number of nails.
So for four nails you could replace awith the commutator of a and d, and a
inverse with the commutator of d and a.Now let's actually do this for five nails, so
I guess I'll replace d with thecommutator of d and e and, d inverse with
the commutator of e and d, which is a 28move combination and though I needed a
heavier picture for this one,it was still pure satisfaction.All right I just got done 
editing the video and first upI wanted to say thank you so much to all
of my new subscribers.Another thing I wanted to say was that I recorded a lot
of material for this video that wound upnot making it in,  just stuff on how to do
large-scale demonstrations as well asbig physics simulations with lots of
nails, but unfortunately that stuffdidn't really fit in with the tone of
the video, and it also made it way waytoo long, so maybe I'll revisit that
stuff on another day if I can figure outa more engaging way to tell those
stories, and I think that's it for me sodon't forget to subscribe if you haven't
already, and peace! :)
