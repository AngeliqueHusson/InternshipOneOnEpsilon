letter A are these adjacent angles arethese ones adjacent angles are theseones adjacent angles or are these onesadjacent angles okay let's go throughthem one by one first of all when wetalk about adjacent angles adjacent doesmean next to an everyday language rightadjacent means you know right next toone another but specifically speakingwhen you work with an angle okay anangle is made up of two rays and avertex the vertex you can think of aslike the hinge of an angle but when twoangles are adjacent to one another whatit means is that not only do they sharethat hinge that vertex but they alsoshare one of the Rays one of the sidesof the angle so adjacent angles reallyshould look something like thisso you letter D they're sharing thatvertex and they're sharing that side andthey're next to one another right solet's look at the common mistakes so inletter A it's true that these angles arenear one another sort of adjacent butnot in the strict sense of what we meanwhen we talk about adjacent angles sothis is not these are not adjacentokay letter B we're getting closer thetwo angles share that vertex for thathinge right but they're still notadjacent sometimes people will confuselike vertical angles like when you havetwo straight lines the angles that areacross from each other with adjacentangles these angles are congruent butthey're not adjacent they just sharethat vertex and then here let us seewhat we have is we have these two angleshere what they're sharing like the sideokay like the side of the angle okay butthey're not sharing that hinge thatvertex okay so this these are notadjacent angles and again letter D wouldbe the best scenario here so they sharethat vertex that hinge and they'resharing one of the Rays the sides sothat's what you're looking for when youtalk about adjacent angles I hope thishelps you to understand this conceptbetter subscribe to the channel checkout some of my other videos on Mario'smath tutoring YouTube channel and I'llsee you in the future videos
