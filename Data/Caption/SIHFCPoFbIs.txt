ah yeah what welcome to class we'regonna do angle ease I hope you have alot of these we're in some Dhamma treeclass and I hope that you will pass notfail welcome to gay math bust it onetime for my good that's me with like tenseconds of thought sobaby mug sir very good the fair ohthanks - okay so the chorus comes fromyou guys all right yeah math yeahalright good jobso today we're doing inscribed angleswhich are danglies for fun you haveapproval on the candy cane yeah yeahyeah okay so uh let's jump into it okayhere's the draw a circle hopefully lessdilapidated map and let's put in a90-degree angle okay so we've seen thisbefore let's talk about it again thisangle and you will know what it's calledessentially central angle right it is 90central angle and it's 90 degreeshappens to be so whatever the centralangle is what relationship does it haveto the arc here it is degree of theangle isyeah so what will this one be please nahthat's right so this is 90okay we've gone over that four centralangle is the same as the measure of thearc now introducing new things why do Igo high pitch I think I don't know solet's do mine like this and you knowwhattake off central angle already know thatand okay now this has a new name it'scalled it's called an inscribed anglethis angle right here okay now notice itdoesn't go through the center it goesthrough an edge it goes to the edge ofthe circle to the end now uh just randomguesses only hear from you I'm gonna dopokerface you know not gonna give anyindication about whether you're right orwrong I just want to see what you thinkdon't even know how many degrees this isvolunteers what do you think okay you'rewho is their hand to say they don't knowthat's very like New Age cutting-edgeyes okay so we have 30 degrees otherguesses yes I just don't see how youwould know okay there is a rule ohthey're all like like when it's a rounda nine year something not around aninety around any arc okay okay 30 40 45another guests 45 now they're guests yesoh wait okaygood guess is all around in fact it is45a lot and I'm going to erase this justfor clarity's sake we're going to put 45here and it's a little bit double ordouble the degrees of a scribed angle asa measure of the arc yep I'm gonna do itI'm gonna go with half right but doubleone-half of the same the inscribed angleis half the included the inscribed angleis half the included arc so let's definewhat we mean we have an arc here of 90notice this art is 90 the inscribedangle that includes this arc issubsequently half that mark thisinscribed angle is always half the arcokay so let's see if you can do a fewmore circle all rightwhat's this line called anyone everyonediameter very good and okay solve forangle X please take a minute think aboutit my ex is very creaky how'd you noticethat - Spider accent but hey that's whatPharaoh's do maybe meaning I have prettygood shoulder motion all right uh whatis the angle of vision if you think youknow four or five six okay what do youthink ninety ninety very good how'd youget it um because the angle other angles80s so how much money what other angleis a doing alright here we gothere we go could you tell me pleasetell us how much that arcus 180 how didyou get that this arc is a hundredeighty please because the diameter thediameter is the diameter cuts the circleinto an arc of a hundred eighty I knowthat's what you mean yeah I know that'swhat you mean can you say that so thediameter the diameter cuts the circletime right and what else the arc is onthe beginning okay now that this arc is180 I'm going to do this just for adifferent vision of it all and now lookclosely you guys this is an arc includedin this inscribed angle and thus theinscribed angle is always half of theart okay questions on thatit's kind of like a flashlight yeah wetalked about the flashlight effect ifyou have a flashlight from the edge ofthe circle that flashlights angle ishalf of the argument closest alrighthere comes another one all right we haveanother diameter pleasegoing straight horizontally in this caseimmediately my recommendation to youlike if you guys were like if I wastutoring you and you were family orsomething like that I would immediatelystart to say to you okay so some of thetricks are the second you see a diameteryou're thinking like you said both armsor what would be 180 right start tothink in those termsokay arcs are 180 how can I use thatplease draw a cord further to the rightover here please draw another cord goingdown from this point to the left allrightI included information is this arc hereis 140 and 8okay please solve for this this overhere bloom this guy and this guy soplease solve for this red angle doesthis angle have a type of name what typeof name is this angle yes it is acute itturns out if you look at its crime butbased on what we're doing yet this is aninscribed angle notice because aninscribed angle starts from the edge andcomes out that's rightso please solve for this inscribed anglethis arc this arc and this arc you haveone of them please uh yeah okayso um you know that the whole arc is 180degress so 180 minus 140 is forty sevenforty here and then you know that thisis um half of 46 okay and we have ourone of our geneshello welcome mat Pharaoh oh no what'sthat that's not my name what's my namesay one two threeand my gesture - okay love-life programis anyone care oh it's not much moneyit's $25 go original mark yeah but yesso that's 20 and that's 40 greatinscribed angle here eighty enclosed arcwould be anyone everyone knows a commonmistake sixty other body yeah 160 anyquestions about why this wants to seewhat I've always freeze what makesascribed anglewhat makes an angle to be inscribed yeahgood any inscribed angle is an anglethat starts with the edge of the circleand then emanates out or emanate standif you will that makes it as opposed toa central angle for example this angleessential because if it's encompassed inthe center central angles that angle isthe same as the arc outside remember thefirst one we did with the 90 centralangle 90 and closed arc 90 inscribedangle half of the arc okay so wheninscribed angle is any angle that startsat the edge okay alright last arc whatdo we have anyone everyone twenty enrollokay next onegood good question is asking how it's 20okay now where what are the limits ofthe because I didn't have to be the samedegree our semicircle semicircle is 180degrees agreed so this is 160 of it sothe remaining art would have to be 20 sothat the bottom half of the circle is180 20 so it's not drawn to skin uh yeahthis would have to be smaller for sureyeah it's not drawn perfectly as Joeyeah the teacher becomes the tots Lauraby reverse aged alright next one okay sonow it's always fun hey teachers are intune to it's all goodhe leftare you always going to have people thatare curious you know really delete themyou know on the tape yeah awkward no nowe got to leave we got to leave in roomfour it's just like bloopers okay so 545okay 145 T&Z okay so our goals are tofind this one's a little hard the goalsare to find this angle here the same olhere and I want to tell you that I sawthis a few moments ago and I said youknow what I'm not going to solve itbefore I get into class I want to solveit with you guys so that we're attackingit together all right so let's take alook I see two inscribed angles allright if you see two inscribed angles -that's good let's start with the 45 ifyou know that this is 45 what else doyou know about the circle please in theback right all right is 19 which Articum the one from 100 to the bottom rightup very good I'm glad you see thatwhat's about seeing it so I'm gonna markit in red there you go this is 90 okaygood job so last one we're doing todayso let's make it count okay so that wehave 90 there please yesno we don't know if we can't assume it'sbisected an accord Levi's a cord can bebisected if it's a distance isperpendicular that's right yes sir willthe other half of that top would be 90like this one here yeah no because itdoesn't go through the middle I'm gladyou brought that upthat's the die oh the diameter diameterthought that was I thought that waswritten dog no that's a random dot yeahI just got this uh never mindthe ball about your thinking okay whatdo I can also use the other inscribedangle of 100 degrees right but itoverlaps then I need a job over leftfrom the table of the 45 till where youwrote 94 where - okay so let's writethat one and that is 200 that's 200 yourjob let's do it so we have this blue oneall the way up to notice this is wheresometimes students have a breakdown solet's have a fix up instead of abreakdown so instead of being confusedat this I want to isolate the hundred inmy vision and I want to say alright thishundred is this angle here what arc doesit include this are going from here allthe way to the next line of it here sothis would be how much sir chi'lan JitsuRonnie why would it be 200 good questionyes because in inscribed angles um theactual angle point is half of the entirearm yes remember the rule the angle ishalf of the arc okay if you're dealingwith inscribed eggs again definition ofinscribed angles any angle that startsat the edge all right yes where does itcome does it matter that like I see it45here is 145 not 10 is to 290 okay thisis because they're both that was your nowe can't these are two differentinscribed angles right so two inscribedangles at different locations you can'tcombine alright so here we arewhat's the next step does anyone seeanything thank okay okay oh yeah okayvibe I'm glad you're you're persistentright so you have from the inscribedangle little dot on the left what 45yeah all the way okayprobably the lack of point to that pointis one under immigrated from here tohere through the center oh you want todraw a you want to draw a line I don'tknow whether this through the middle -there will be a diameterI can't assume that you know becausewhat at this point was here and I justdidn't draw it that way and I wouldn'tknow that I can draw a diameter you knowbut I like the instinct is to create ahundred eighty so that we would havemore info but we can't assume okayanother guess so great guess is you guyswhat if you draw one right down themiddlewell then I don't know how much of this200 would be in the 1ep let's not drawanything else I think there's more ofthose info we can do what do you thinkwe try to find where how much is inbetween like how much 19 to 200 yeahyeah yeah there's some overlap here's agood day so let's work on the overlapcheck it out this is 90 and then what doyou think do you know what this to thatwould be maybe worship no unfortunatelywork here good guess - isn't it 110 it'sturtleproblem solved it's turtle oh so I'mworking on the 110 right so if we'rethinking about one Teddy I don't knowwhy why really about 110 because IIwonder my friend well righthowever - so where would 110 exactly getthat from no but it wouldn't workbecause this would have to be all theway up hereit wouldn't be drugs Excalibur yeah it'snot the scale we can assume it's notphysicalso the red line the whole visionary thered line is 90blew that to the to the neck down on topfrom the blue to this 200yeah that's 200 so can't you see it'sone is or somethingum okay no I see something else check itout this is 200 right so I'm saying thatthe blue got it done done blue all theway has to be 165 to be 160 yeah whybecause I lost in sixty degreesstarboard Stern just exceed its the restof the circle it's the rest of thecircle so what did it just because a reddot with the blue tone do you agree thatfrom here all the way that is 200 sojust the rest of the circle and then putin as 160 I don't because okay I'm gladyou're asking these music my messagefrom here I'm going to kind of turn myback a little from here going down tothis finger is 200 correct so what's therest of the circle I'm glad you'reasking so there that's 200 so the restof the circle is 160okay does this art that I just drew the160 does that have an inscribed angleassociated with it yes it does it doesdoesn't it so it's the bottom rightindigo oh yeah just cries the bottomright I mean yeah so let's go back towhere I wasthis 160 going up a blue dotted line isan arc that inscribes this angle hereand so what is this measure then 880any questions seriously so far to theright of you now are missing that rightyeah we're not doneyou're right okay and so now we needthis angle oh I know oh yeah we can dothe whole point is oh it's just umyou're into 60-90 it's range of 60-90yes all right let's do it okay let's doit out do it the red dotted line herecomes do you agree that from here tohere is 90 right yes I'm here to here'sa 90 so let's do the rest of the circleon the left side so how many degreeswould that be on the arc 170 360 true mmtrue semi right so from here to here thedot the solid the solid red line is 90so now we're going to go around the restof the circle rest of the circle rest ofthe circle this whole thing back to whatwe didn't do is 90 the rest is what 270okay why 70 80 70 60 minutes 360 minus 9to get angle is 1 could be again ifwe're working together and I was sayingokay this is a way to do well on thesetests so always say all circles are 360if all circles are 360 this is 90 of itso the rest of it must be 270 oh how didyou seventies would be right by wait sowe've got that little bit applied to thearc is 90 I mean it does so but it'slike but it's not quite with money noit's notoh that's nothing strands not in scrapit's in arc very good it's an art so thearc that's left over is 270 okay we'realmost done with this and now indeedthis same where my finger is inscribesthe arc of 270 so that degree135 yeah 135please feel free to ask if you do notsee that this angle inscribes an arc of2/7okay I'm glad what gravity um that wasme dropping marker good jobplease give yourselves a good hand doyou even have a guest No thank you guysfor showing um okay so I'm gonna take itup with the rap mmm clap it up cough itup oh I like to freestyle in the carfreestyle in the car and we drive sovery far it's about me and who you are Ican't say your name but that's okay jarbecause you're in a jar butterfliesgonna fly this is the butter I love thelooklook at that moving passionately getclose okay
