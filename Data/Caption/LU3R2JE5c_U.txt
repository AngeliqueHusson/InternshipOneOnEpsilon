so in this video I want to go overmultiplying fractions and multiplyingfractions in my opinion is easier thanadding or subtracting fractions becauseyou don't need a common denominator ourbottom numbers do not need to be thesame you can always multiply fractionsand the only thing that you need to dois just multiply the numerators andmultiply the denominators and I wrotethat for you in green in the bottom leftpart of the screen so let's just getstarted right away with this examplehere we have four-fifths multiplied bytwo-thirds so following our steps wejust need to multiply our numerators inour numerator we have a 4 and a 2 so I'mgoing to multiply our 4 and 2 togetherin our numerator and in our denominatorswe have a 5 and a 3 so in ourdenominator I'm going to multiply the 5and the 3 together so in our numeratorwe have 4 times 2 which is just 8 and inour denominator we have 5 times 3 whichis 15 and this is our final answer sonow I want to go over an example wherewe have a negative fraction so let's saywe have a negative 1/2 multiplied by 3over 5 and the first thing I want topoint out is where I can move thenegative sign in front of the fractionit's perfectly okay to move the negativesign into the numerator of the fractionor into the denominator of the fractionit doesn't matter but what I like to dois I just like to move that negativesign into the numerator so now we canmultiply these fractions right away onceagain we multiply our numeratorstogether so in our numerator we're goingto multiply our negative 1 and our threeand in our denominator we're going tomultiply R 2 and R 5 and this simplifiesto negative 1 times 3 in our numeratorwhich is just negative 3 and 2 times 5in our denominator which is just 10 sohere are somevideos with some more example problemsrelated to the video you just watchedI really hope you're finding mytutorials helpful so until my next videoI will see you later
