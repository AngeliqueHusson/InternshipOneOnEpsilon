all right in this video I just want todo some problems some basic problemsrelated to limits and graphs basicallybeing able to look at a graph andevaluate a limit I think it's you knowlimits are something you do a lot incalculus and I think to do a lot oflimits I think about graphs of functionsso it's kind of a fundamental idea sonothing hopefully too heavy this isstuff that you know certainly can beconfusing the first time or the secondtime or the third time you see it butthis is the basic idea so if you look atour graph here you know y equals f of Xnotice it's a there's a little break init at the x coordinate of 3 there's alittle hole so there's a point ofdiscontinuity and that's finenothing nothing going on there just youknow one little observation here so justto pick on a point in particular noticeif you take an x coordinate that getscloser and closer say two x equals threeif we take an x value that gets closerand closer to three whether we kind ofcome from the left side of three thatmeans using smaller values obviously orfrom the right side of three and thatmeans we're using well values largerthan three if you think about on thecorresponding graph what are the Yvalues getting closer to four those Xvalues well to me it looks like as Xgets closer and closer and closer tothree the Y values on the graph aresimply getting closer and closer to twoso no big deal so I went ahead and wrotethat down basically it says again as Xgets closer to three f of X orequivalently the Y values those getcloser to the number twonotice it's even undefined too becauseof the open circle still you know as Xgets closer to 3 the Y valuesnumerically get closer to 2 we writethat as as the following we say thelimit as X approaches 3 of the functionf of X equals 2 so to me when I see thisnotation all it says is it says you'vegot some graph y equals f of X if youplug in stuff close to 3 it says hey theY values get close to 2 we write anequal sign I think that's a littlemisleading because it never actuallyequals 2 but it gets as close to it asyou want and that's the idea so let'slook at a couple problems here with agraph and we'll just try to answer someof these ok so notice my little graphhere it's got to break it negative 2it's got a vertical asymptote at xequals 2 there's another little breakhere in x equals 4 so the first questionhere just says what is f of 0 well allthat means is right you're just pluggingin x equals 0 what's the corresponding Yvalue well in this case F of 0 wouldjust equal the Y value of 2 hopefullyyou can see that likewise this limitquestion it says okay what's the limitas X approaches 0 of f of X so againthat to me says as X gets closer to 0what do the Y values get closer to wellhere's X equals zero so I just find thecorresponding graph and again I thinkwell as X gets closer and closer to zeroon the graph the Y values are gettingcloser and closer to the number two nomatter which side you come from so inthis case we'll say the limit as Xapproaches zero of f of X is also twoand this is something that's importantyou'll see this in another part of theproblem here this has to be a uniquenumber if not we simply say the limitdoesn't exist okay so what if we askwhat's F of negative 2well that simply says if you plugnegative 2 into the function what do youget out what's the corresponding y-valuewell this simply says if you plugnegative 2 n since our dot is up here at5 it says if you plug negative 2 n wellyou get 5 out okay however if we look atthe limit as X approaches negative 2again that simply means if we takex-coordinates close to negative 2 if wetake x-coordinates close to negative 2what are the corresponding y-valuesgetting closer and closer to and in thiscase it looks like if X gets closer andcloser to negative 2 to me the Y valuesare getting closer and closer to 1 so inthis case I would say the limit as Xapproaches negative 2 is just 1 so againthis is important it doesn't actuallymatter what happens at negative 2 itjust happened the only thing that'simportant is what happens when you getclose to negative 2 I get close tonegative 2 the Y values get close to 1ok so let's see a couple more heresuppose we do the limit as X approachespositive 2 of our function f of X wellin this case as X approaches 2 the Yvalues on the graph well they just getbigger and bigger and bigger and biggerand it doesn't matter whether you comefor the left or the right they just getlarger larger and larger sometimes ifthey go to infinity people will say itdoes not exist in this case I wouldactually write that I would say well thelimit goes to positive infinity and whatthat means is again it just says thegraph is spiking off ok let's see just afew more here F of 4 that says if youplug 4 in what Y value do you get outwell if you plug 4 in it looks likeyou're getting out the Y value of 1and just a couple more questions herelet's do suppose we ask ourself what'sthe limit as X approaches four I leftthis one out well notice in this case itkind of depends because if you take youknow x coordinates that are close tofour but smaller than fourwell those Y those Y values get closerand closer to one right so X values tothe left of four that means I'm going tobe on the graph just a little bit to theleft of 4 and the Y values get closer to1 well but if you do it you know for Xvalues just a little bit bigger than 4well now you're on the upper portion ofthe graph and then it says the Y valuesget closer and closer to I don't knowwe'll pretend it's lining up here atpositive 4 so you can't say two numbersyou can't say it's like 1 and 4 you knowin this case if the limits aren't thesame from opposite sides and we have abetter way of saying this we simply saythat the limit does not exist in thatcase so to me basically it says ifthere's a break or a jump in the graphthe limit doesn't existhowever we can talk about limits fromthe left and limits from the right ongraphs so this will be the last twoproblems here what we'll do is we'llwrite the limit as X approaches 4 andthat we've got a little positive signwhat that means is from the right of thenumber 4 and if we're to the right ofthe number 4 that means we're usingnumbers well that are larger than 4 soin this case if we take x coordinatesthat are larger than 4 so bigger than 4but we're getting closer to 4 if youthink about the corresponding Y valueson the graph well those Y values aregetting closer and closer to the number4 so we would say the limit as Xapproaches 4 from the right is 4 and ifwe do the limit as X approaches 4 fromthe left ok so if we take numbers alittle bit smaller than 4 well now the Yvalues on the graph are getting closerand closer to the number positive 1 sowe would say the limit as X approaches 4from the left of f of X is positive 1 soa lot of a lot of stuff kind of crammedinto this video over limits so again ifit's the first time you're seeing limitsand graphs I think they're definitelyyou know can be a little confusing butit's definitely an idea that you've gotto master before you can really I thinkif not you know things just you knowlimits don't go away and if you don'tget a handle on them they get confusingyou know everything stays confusing andprobably again I think the best way tothink about limits a lot of times tovisualize is to really understand themgraphically so all right I hope thisvideo makes some sense and helps you outout there
