what number can you add 2x squared minus6x to complete the perfect squaretrinomial so trinomial is just apolynomial with three terms so right nowwe have two terms so they're essentiallysaying can we add a term hereessentially a number constant so thatthis becomes a perfect square theexpression once it becomes a trinomialbecomes a perfect square so let me justrewrite it here x squared minus 6x sowe're going to add something right overhere so that the entire expression canbe a perfect square a perfect square ofa binomial and to think about that let'sthink about what a perfect square wouldlook like and so let's imagine let'simagine if we had something like X plusa X plus a squared what would that looklike if we would expand it out let me dothis in another color to show you thatthis is kind of a little bit of a sidenote so let me do it in blue so if I hadX plus some constant a squared well thisis the same thing as X plus a times Xplus a and this is the same thing as youmight remember this pattern or we'lljust multiply it out we'll just multiplyevery term here by every term here so xtimes X is x squared then x times a is aX then a times X is a X then we have atimes a is a squared and that all justcomes out of doing the distributiveproperty twice or you can think of it asfoil if you find that a little biteasier although that's a little bit moremechanical and this gives you x squaredplus 2ax plus a squared so if you have atrinomial in this form it's a perfectsquare and it can be factored into Xplus a squared and we see the patternhere and both in this case and in thiscase the coefficient on the x squaredterm is one and then we see whatever thecoefficient whatever the coefficienthere is on the first degree term on theX whatever that coefficient is if wetake half of that number and square itand make that the constant then thiswill be a perfect square for examplehalf of 2a is a and we're squaring aright over here and that makes this aperfect square so let's do the exactsame thing with our binomialsoon to be a trinomial let's look at thefirst degree coefficient it is anegative six you could view this rightover here as our 2a and so what is halfof this or another way to think of it is2a is equal to negative six if we justpattern match right over here so whatwould a be a would be equal to a wouldbe equal to negative three and so if weadded a squared to this to thisexpression right here it would be aperfect square so we literally just tookhalf of this which is negative 3 andthen we're going to square it sonegative 3 squared is positive 9 so thisright over here is just a squared noticeI called this 2a I took half of it tofigure out what a is and I squared it toget this 9 here so I just took negative6 divided by 2 is negative 3 squared itgot 9 and if you wanted to factor thisout we have x squared minus 6x plus 9 sowhat two numbers when you take theirproduct you get 9 and when you add themtogether you get negative 6 wellnegative 3 and negative 3 so this isgoing to be X minus 3 times X minus 3 oryou could think of it as X minus 3squared so it is a perfect squaretrinomial
