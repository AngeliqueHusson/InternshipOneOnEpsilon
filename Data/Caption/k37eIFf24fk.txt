welcome there are two very specialbuildings in the US the MormonTabernacle in Salt Lake City and theWhispering Gallery in the US Capitolbuilding the both oval-shapedrooms and here's the amazing propertythey possess there are two speciallocations in these rooms I'll call itspot a and spot B they have the propertythat someone stands at point a is calledan Albert and whisper something all thesound waves from his whisperings be veryquiet whisperings will go in alldirections but each sound wave turns togo softly into hits a wall bounces offand amazingly heads directly towards thesecond point no matter which directionone sound waves coming from they allbounce off the walls and head directlytowards B so all the sound waves fromAlberts whispers come and hit billBert's ears perfectly but not only thatthe distance each sound wave travelsso all these crooked paths turn out tobe exactly the same length so each soundwave travels the same amount of time toarrive at peace they arrivedsynchronously at B so B can hear themperfectly well so whatever a whispersthey all come and hit these earspertinent even hear the whisper withabsolute precise position this is what Imean by the reflection property of mylips the special oval shaped curve iscalled an ellipse and they have thisamazing property that all sound wavesknow which direction they go or bounceoff the walls and head towards a secondfocal point point B and do so in exactlythe same amount of time distancestraveled is always the same so I'd liketo prove that today all right to beginwith I have to set the scene I'm gonnamake sure I understand what I mean byreflection I'll make sure I understandwhat I mean by ellipse and then go aheadand prove that ellipses have thisproperty all right so first of all let'stalk about what is a reflection andwe'll go down a notch in that insophistication and just imagine I had awall straight wall and obviously if Ithrow a ball straight at the wall youknow swimming is a perfect world itdoesn't lose energy due to inelasticcollisions so forth or just bouncestraight back at me if I come down at 90degrees to the ball so he goes down withsome velocity V will head back to me thesame velocity V just opposite directionnow if I give that ball a slight lateralmotion so I throw it at an angleit's vertical component velocity isstill the same and it's moving at aconstant horizontal components my ballwill come down to total duel nowvertically it's going to travel at somevelocity V and in that time we'll movesome distance horizontally but here thevertical motion is going to be the sameit's going to follow the same propertyas if I just threw it directly that it'svertical components Dugan will godirectly backwards but at the same timeit still has the same horizontalmeasures you'll travel the samehorizontal distance way this way butcome back the same distance because thatvertical motion is going to be at samemagnitude but in opposite direction soit means my bouncing ball comes in atsome angle is some angle bounces off thewall and since we've got Congress Ryungwas here I'm guessing it bounces off atthe same angle again so there's aproperty of reflection what I mean byreflection is that any ball or Soundwaveor any object will always hit a straightwall with equal incoming angle and equaloutgoing angle my physical business willactually use a slightly differentversion of these angles to call on theangle of incidence angle of reflectionbut basically two equal angles all rightthat's a straight wall make sure Iunderstand what happens when a ballbounces off a curved wall that's alittle bit tricky so let's do that letme draw a curved wall here's my pen andimagine a ball comes in to bounce offthis curved wall what's it going to do Iwas it's going to bounce back but Idon't understand what it means now allright bouncing is a very localphenomenon that is all the actionshappening right down hereso it means for us to zoom that pictureout I've got some sort of picture likethis would let's make it be a littlemore flatter I guess and I have thisball bounce again like yonder wellactually that's a very local phenomenontoo if i zoom in right there you can seethat my war is basically going to be inmy best as human estimations could bestraighter and straighter and straighterif I keep doing and zooming in thephysicalness and Mars will be assumingthe ball is straight so I really gone toan idea of calculus taking things to theextreme limitwhat's gonna happen the ball is gonnacome in and as far as the ball can tellright as it's sort of zoomed in degreethat's really bouncing off a section ofa straight wall you can't tell thedifference between curved and straightin the ideal sense well for a straightwall we know as it comes in with equalangles of incidence reflection so let'ssee what that means in terms of goingbackwards on this picture that's thevery zoomed in picture where - allpractical purposes for the humanists ifi zoom into some millions - millions andpower it looks like it's about astraight wall and a mathematical sense izoomed into the infinite degree whateverthat means no talking calculus it alsoexpands you have a straight wall wellwhere's that straight line really Iguess I need a pen a different colorthere's the straight line I guess thestraight line is here slightly curved todraw here's the straight lines slightlyoff the curve over here here's thestraight line slightly off the curvewhat's really doing though the ball isbouncing off the tangent line to thecurve at that point of contact so - fora ball to reflect off a curved wallmeans let's get my pen back go go here'sa curved wall the ball comes in hits atsome point and then bounce off thatpoint as though it's bouncing off thetangent line to the curve with equalangles of incidence and reflection sobeing a ball or a sound wave to bounceof a curve also to come in at equalangles from the tangent line greatthat's what reflection is now what's anellipse well as per usual I know startoff back a step ellipse a special caseof a circle and how do I make a circleso imagine I had a nail in the wall andI took a loop of string and I lookedstuck one end of the string to the nailpull it up and stuck the other impactdown to the now if I took a pen orpencil and put it right at the end ofthe loop and pull the loop taut hasswung around I'm gonna start tracingyour curve sees me and clearly sinceI've got a fixed radius here that curvesgonna be a perfect circle well it lipsis exactly the same idea except I justbe a little bit funky with the ends ofmy string so having both ends meet atthe same point in the in the wall wellI have one special point point a for oneend of my string and tell the other andit must ring at a point B I will use apencil to take that loop of string andmake it taut that is I have a pencil atsome point up here and then a swing thatpencil around keeping the string tautand that's going to trace the curve nowit might be fun to actually play with itbut what you'll find happens if youswing this all the way around you'll geta squished circle shape and there we arethat's squish circle shape is goldenblips so what ellipses is a curve withtwo special points I usually call thefoci the first I focus a focus B suchthat each is the location of a pooledpiece of string which means is the truedefinition an ellipse has occur for theproperty that for two special pointsain't be any point P on that curve isthe property that distance between a andP plus the distance means P and B thedistance between a and P plus P and B isa fixed constant in this case is alength of string so that's an ellipseall right now what do I mean by thereflection property of an ellipse wellcluding you start to see the connectionnow whoops press the wrong thing so Ihave an ellipse is my true foci and bealbum Dilbert I claimed that the MormonTabernacle is actually made as thosefrom a piece a pooled piece of string orwork or something alright so the claimis that for the reflection property anysound wave coming from Alberts positionwill travel in a straight line willbounce off the wall ah what we learnedby bouncing is information I had atangent line to the ellipse right atthat point with equal angle at an equalreflection it comes off at equal angleand the amazing thing is apparently thatequal angle reflection heads the soundwave directly back at B so no matterwhere I go I've got to prove that theangles are the tangent line to thatpoint on the ellipseare always equal has a very bad picturethat will force the sound waves toactually bounce back at B now sincethese links are the same length ofstring I've actually got my additionalprofit that all the sad way to travelthe same distance to have it be so whatI need to prove the reflection propertyellipse that at any point on the ellipsethe line connecting that point to eachof the first I makes equals angles ofincidence and reflection now I'm justdescribed by on how to prove let mestart the video not actually provingthis all right I actually love thisproof because I'm come at this in acompletely strange unexpected way I'mgonna go back to the beginnings in somesense and talk about straight wallsalright so imagine here's my here's myproblem 44 for the moment there's a walland I have a dog who's currently atposition may and would like to walk toposition B and being a dog the dog wouldfirst like to watch the wall and thenwalk over to to position base and theball was gonna walk the straight line atsome point on the wall and they're headover straight to be my question is whichpoint contact should the brought the doghead to so as to get the shortestdistance from A to B via the wall so youmight wonder okay maybe if the dogs togo directly below the point B and thenhit straight up maybe the dog she goesdirectly below the point a and head onover maybe the dog should go to themidpoint twixt a and B or something andthen head over who knows but whatposition along the wall is the shortestpath from A to B via the wall okay I'mgonna answer that question two differentways to strangely completely differentways and we'll see the reflectionproperly ellipse pops out from ouranalysis so let me just redraw mypicture solution number onea B maybe I should keep a copy of thispicture because it seems to be asemi-decent woman like me what I usuallydo all right hey guys I don't know wherethe special I'll keep doing that don'tknow where that special point is butI'll do this in blue so one thing tonote it's very hard to deal with crookedpaths so why I do is inspired itprobably takes a long while for someoneto think to do this trick and once yousee this tricky thing I think to do itin other situations but some brightspark at some point realized well-servedabout powers that go from A to B whatwere you looked at the reflection ofPart B on the other side of the wallhere's the point B primedthat means if I walked to someplacepoint on the B run upon the wall herethe path to B give me mirrored by pathto be primed and you know it's nice andperfectly symmetrical this length equalsthis length so walking from A to Bfather wall is the same as walking a tobe primed by the wall this length mustdouble dash is the same as this lengthis the other double dash and converselyif I give a path that goes from A to thewall and then at point on the wall to beprimed that really does correspond to apath that goes from A to the wall andthen that point to B and all that makesmatch that match this itself and thislength matches this length so actuallythe shortest path from A to B is reallygiven by the shortest path from A to Bprimed and I know the answer thatproblem what's the shortest path betweentwo points well is the straight-linepath so that means to find the specialplace on the wall the dog should walk tois you imagine the wall as a mirror andwalk to the reflection of be primed inthat mirror because for this point herebut of course the dogs don't be able towalk to the wall so people won't be ableto walk to the second position untilsaid we'll turn up this way all rightbut let's notice something here look atthis angle here in messy green mypictures bad well I've got verticalangles from a pair of crossing linesthat equals the single here so but sinceour B prime is just reflection of bethis angle under thefootball is the same as this angle abovethe ball so actually the answer theproblem is the dog should walk to thespecial place B that gives equal anglesof incidence and reflection as thoughthe dog were actually a bouncing balloff the wall so the shortest path from Ato B via the wall is the point thatgives equal angles just like reflectionall rightthat's answer number one to the problemhere's answer number two and did indeedsave my picture yesclever me answer number two - the verysame problem what I'm gonna do is I'mgonna draw ellipses with a and B asfirst sign now if I did a very shortstring that barely reaches across I'mgonna get a sort of a a fairly flat ovalthere's a shortest short string but it aslightly longer string I'd get aslightly biggerI said overall didn't I should have saidellipse yes slightly bigger ellipse thatcorresponds to a longer piece of stringbut at a really long piece of string I'mgonna get a huge being ellipsethere's a longer piece of string alrightnow I want to find the point on the ballor on the wall that gives me the largestdistance from A to B all right he goesthere so the shortest distance made tobe silly me well clearly this brightblue ellipse corresponds to some crookedpath that's that I'm walking to the ballbut it's not big enough to hit the wallthis green ellipse does correspond tosome crooked path from A to B butthere's a whole bunch of differentcrooked paths I can choose from butthey're again they're not quite longenough to hit the wall and hit the nomatter what I do they don't hit the walllet me choose the size of ellipse thatjust hits the wall at some special pointthere this is a length of string thatcorresponds to hitting the wall justperfectly all right now the red ellipsedoesn't do much for me it gives me apoint on the wall yes no doubt it's apoint in the wall but it hits but it'sit's a giving a path from A to B there'sactually longer than the matching yellowpath hang on what am i doing is this thepoint silly mesorry here's a is a is the red path goshthere it is that is if I did a biggerellipse in the yellow one I'm getting apoint on the wall that cross wants alonger piece of string and therefore waslonger than the yellow one so thisyellow lips is the first ellipse thattouches the wall and it's the smallestellipse that I can use that touches thewall that is this yellow path is indeedthe answer to my dog walking problem isthe smallest length that just touchesthe wall that gives me a crooked pathfrom A to B via the wall there it isthat tells me that the special point I'mlooking for for this dog-walking problemis this point here well now I've got twoanswers to the same problem this point Pfor the ellipse version must be the sameanswer as this point B for this walkingversionthat is I've got a situation thatdescribes the reflection property of thelips perfectly here's a point on theellipse the wall is the tangent line tothis ellipse is the one that justtouches the ellipse and we proved thatit is the answer to the dog-walkingproblem that means was the answer thedog-walking problem it has this propertyover on the left the angle to the leftis the angle to the right from this linethat just touches the wall at the pointof contact the tangent line at a pointof contact this is exactly what weneeded for the property of the ellipseand just to make myself clear because mydiagrams as per usual I'm Missy if Itake any order lipshere's any order ellipse point a point Bis to first I I choose any point P on itthere's a point P it's tangent linecorresponds to a dog-walking problem gofrom a to that blue line back to be atsome point that gives the shortestdistance so this black ellipse must bethe first ellipse that touches thistangent line which means it is theanswer to the dog-walking problem whichmeans it has the same property as thefirst way and as the dog-walking problemequal angles about other side of thattangent line that is this ellipse ishaving the reflection property i washoping for any sound wave from a it'sthe tangent line bounced off at equalangles and hits directly towards b anddoes so at the same distance no matterwhere i am to be doing my analysis thereit is there is the dog-walking problemthe direction probably of the lips fireddog-walkingnow the wonderful thing is there areactually reflection properties for otherchronic shapes the parabola andhyperbola and they're just variationsthe ellipse you can actually prove themin the same sort of way can you find theright dog walking problem to solve thereflection property for hyperbola or thecorrect dog walking problem for that forthe parabola which means you probablyate under samples reflection propertiesare and I'm gonna be shameless right nowif you go to my website I actually wrotethe third volume I Siriwhich covers the whole you know highschool curriculum actually has the finalchapter on comics and how to understandellipses parabolas and hyperbolas andexplains all the geometry of allreflection properties so you might wannalook at chapter 3 if you get reallythree if you get really really stuck allright there we gothanks so muchyou
