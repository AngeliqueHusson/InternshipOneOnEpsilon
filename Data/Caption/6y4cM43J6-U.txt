Welcome to my secret math tutorWe're going to go over two examples of front-end rounding if you've never heard of this type of rounding, that's okayThis is basically how it worksWe find the largest place value in the number and then we round to that place valueAll right. So, let's see how this works. So here's the numbers728first identified the largest place valueThat'd be this seven guy right here. And then of course check the number just to the right of itOver here at this twonow the two will tell you whether to keep the seven the same orRounded up to an eightRemember that if this number is four or lower. We'll keep it as a sevenBut if it is five or higher, then we'll make that seven and eightAll right. Well since it's just a two that's four or lower. We will leave the seven just as it isThe rest of the numbers we will make a zeroSo using front and rounding728 is approximately700 just like thatAll right, let's do this one more time. So in this next number, we have three thousand nine hundred and thirteenfirst find the largest place valueThat's the thousands with a three hanging outokay, check the spot just off to the right andDetermine what we should do with this three. Should we leave it a three or maybe bump it up to a four?Well, since it's a nine I know to bump this three up to a fourAnd just like before we'll make the rest of those numbers a zeroSo three thousand nine hundred thirteen is approximately four thousand and there you goThat's front and rounding.
