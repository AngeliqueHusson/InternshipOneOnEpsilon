look at triangle ABC in this trianglemeasure of angle a is given us 50degrees and the measure of angle B isgiven us 70 degrees along with thistriangle we're also given triangle d EFin this triangle we are given that themeasure of angle D is 50 degrees and themeasure of angle E is 70 degrees withthis given data we want to know iftriangles ABC and D EF are similar thereare two conditions we have studied forsimilarity the triple-s and a triple acondition since we haven't been providedwith the sides the triple-s conditionwon't work the Triple A condition saysthat if all three angles of one triangleequal the three corresponding angles ofanother triangle then the triangles willbe similar so does it mean that we donot have enough data to know if thetriangles are similar or not let's findout we have been given that angle a iscongruent to angle D and angle B iscongruent to angle E we know that thesum of all angles in a triangle equals180 degrees so in triangle ABC angle Aplus angle B plus angle C will equal 180degrees out of these three we know themeasures of two angles angle a measuresfifty degrees and angle B measuresseventy degrees angle A plus angle B is120 degrees so this can be written as120 degrees plus angle C equals 180degrees transposing 120 degrees to theother side we get the measure of angle Cas 60 degrees so we cut the measure ofthe third angle of this triangle as 60degrees similarly we find the measure ofangle F in this triangle as 60 degreesso the measure ofSanga is also equal to the measure ofthis angle basically with data of justtwo pairs of corresponding angles wecould figure out the similarity betweentriangles so this condition in which weneed just two angles to be congruent forsimilarity is called the double legconditionlet me repeat even if just two pairs ofcorresponding angles are congruent wecan say that the triangles are similar
