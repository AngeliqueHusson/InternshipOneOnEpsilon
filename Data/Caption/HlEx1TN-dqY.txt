so now we will be going over dividingdecimals here we have thirty-one pointseven seven three being divided by fivepoint one so let's set this up usinglong division we have thirty-one pointseven seven three on the inside beingdivided by five point one and the onething that you have to remember and Iwrote this for you in green you have toget rid of the decimal in the outsidenumber so we have an outside number offive point one we need to get rid ofthis decimal in the outside number sobasically we have to push this decimalpoint as far right as possible in thisparticular example we only can push itover one space and whatever you do tothe outside number you have to do to theinside number so since we move theiroutside decimal one space to the rightwe have to do the same thing to theinside decimal so now since we move bothdecimal points one space to the rightour five point one becomes a fifty-oneand our thirty-one point seven seventhree becomes three hundred andseventeen point seven threeso 31 point 7 73 divided by five pointone is exactly the same as 317 pointseven three divided by 51 so now I'mjust going to give myself a little bitmore space and erase this on the top andI'll move this a little farther up sonow that we got rid of the decimal inthe outside number we can just dividethis using normal long division so let'sjust get started right away51 goes into three zero times since 51is bigger than three so we'll move tothe next digit 51 goes into thirty onezero times since 51 is bigger thanthirty-oneso we'll move on to the next digitfifty-one goes into 317 how many timeswell we know that 50 goes into806 times so I'm going to guess that 51goes into 317 about six times so now ifwe multiply the 6 times 1 we get 6 and 6times 5 is 30 and if we subtract the twonumbers we get 7 minus 6 which is 1 and1 minus 0 which is just 1 and I'll bringdown my 7 so 51 goes into 117 how manytimes well we know that 50 goes into 1002 times so I'll guess that 51 goes into117 about two times and 2 times 1 is 2and 2 times 5 is 10 so 7 minus 2 is 5and 1 minus 0 is just 1 and bring downmy 3 and before I go any further withthis example I want to place our decimalpoint our decimal point just needs tomove straight up so it goes directly inbetween the 6 and the 2 so now how manytimes does 51 go into 153 but we know 50goes into 150 3 times so I'll guess that51 goes into 153 3 times as well 3 times1 is 3 and 3 times 5 is 15so 153 minus 150 3 is 0 so we have aremainder of 0 which means that we canstop so now we divided 31 point 7 73 by5 point 1 and we have a final answer of6 point 2 3 so here are some more videoswith some more example problems relatedto the video you just watchedI really hope you're finding mytutorials helpful so until my next videoI will see you lateryou
