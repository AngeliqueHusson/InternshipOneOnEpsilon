welcome to my first video posting aboutdiscrete mathematics I thought a niceplace to start with the discretemathematics is binomial coefficients andthey are contained inside of Pascal'striangle if you've never seen Pascal'striangle before then why don't you clickhere to check out my other channel whereI give you five reasons why Pascal'striangle is really cool in this videowhat I'm going to do is prove to you whythese numbers n choose K turn up to bethe coefficients in the expansion of aplus B to the power of n it uses acombinatorial proof and we're going toexplain howif you've taken some high school mathyou've probably seen the following aplus B's all squared is equal to a plusB times a plus B and if you work it outyou get a squared plus two a B plus Bsquared and you may have even memorizedthis as a fact but have you ever thoughtabout it more generally than this whatif you take a plus B to the power of onewell that's just a plus B it's a littlebit boring but you could keep going youcould say what about a plus B to thepower of zero anything to the power ofzero is onenow let's skip start getting bigger solet's say a plus B to the power of threeif you write out a plus B 3 times andmultiply it all together you'll findthat you get a to the power of threeplus three times a squared B plus threetimes a B squared plus B cubed now ifyou stop for a moment and look at thecoefficients here you'll see here wehave a coefficient of one here we have acoefficient of one and one so let'sstart writing these down first I had a 1and then I get another one and a 1 andthen in the next expansion I get a 1 anda 2 and a 1 and then next I get 1 3 3 1and this is building up Pascal'striangle you may find this interestingor you may have even heard of thisbefore and you've just memorized it as afact that you can find the coefficientsfor these type of expansions in Pascal'striangle in this video I'm going toprove to you why that's the case thefact we're going to prove is that a plusB to the power of n is equal to thesummation from k equals 0 to n wherewe're taking terms n choose K times a tothe N minus K times B to the K and thisis for any integer and bigger than orequal to zero in case you're a littlebit unfamiliar with summation notationthis is equal to let's think about whathappens when K equals 0 you get n choose0 and then a power of a to the N and Bis to the power of 0 so we don't need towrite it plus and choose 1 times a tothe power of n minus 1 times B and wekeep going until we get to n choose Nand now a will be to the power of 0 sowe just have B to the power of n ifyou've heard me talking about n choose Kbefore youheard me refer to it as a binomialcoefficient especially when I talk aboutPascal's triangle the reason why it'scalled a binomial coefficient is becausethey occur here as the coefficients inthis expansion of this binomialexpression you may be interested to knowthat there is indeed a generalization tomultinomial coefficients but for thisvideo I'm just going to focus on why nchoose K is this binomial coefficient sobefore going through the proof let'sjust make sure that our little examplesup here do make sense in terms of whatwe've written down down here let's takea look at a plus B to the power of threeif we look at what we ended up with wehave a to the power of three with acoefficient of one the coefficient ofone is like three to zero there is oneway to select zero things from acollection of three things so that's howyou get this coefficient of one the nextcoefficient should be three choose oneand indeed that equals three and we cansee that the power of a has decreasedone by one and the power of B hasincreased by one similarly the nextcoefficient is 3 because that's threechoose two and again the power of a hasdecreased and the power of B hasincreased and our final term has a B tothe power of three with a coefficient ofone and that's like three choose threeso before working through the proof makesure you've convinced yourself that thisfact does hold for these small cases sohere's the proof let's start by writingout what a plus B to the power of nmeans it means take a plus B times aplus B times a plus B and keep goinguntil you've done thatn times so I'm going to call this firstone the first piece and the second onethe second piece the third piece andthen up to the nth piece now let's thinkcarefully about how we would expand thisout to get the full product as a quickreminder let's just scroll back up toour little example on let's say N equalstwo so right here at the top when wehave a plus B times a plus B and weexpand this out we have to look at allthe different combinations that couldhappen so we look at here we have atimes a and that's what gives us this asquared so we've selected the a andwe've selected the a here we've selectedthe a from the first pieceand here we've selected the a from thesecond piece the next thing we could dois to multiply this a by this B so herewe would have selected an A and a B andthat gives us one of these terms a Bwhich happens again when we select the Band the a so that happens again and thatgives us this 2 right hereand finally we could have selected the Bfrom the first piece and the B from thesecond piece and that gives us this termright here so what we've learned fromlooking at this is that in each of thepieces we can select either the a or theB to end up in the final productso what we've learned is that to form aterm in the final product we will haveselected either an A or B from each ofthe end pieces this means that a generalterm will look like some coefficientI'll just write coefficient for nowtimes a to some power let's call it Itimes B to some power let's call it K wemust have I plus k equal to n sincethere are n pieces in the product thismeans that we're going to have ourcoefficient times a to the power n minusK times B to the power of K to form aterm in the final expansion that has Bto the power of K we must have selectedB from K of the end pieces and there aren choose K possible ways to do this wemust also have selected a from the othern minus K pieces and how many ways arethere to do that n minus K choose nminus K which equals 1 therefore ourcoefficient is equal to n choose K andthis completes our proof so to recap weknow that a generic term will look likea coefficient which we now know to be nchoose K times a to the power of n minusK times B to the K and that's a genericterm and we have to look at all thepossible terms that we would have gottenand sum them all up and that's how weget this expansion right here if you'veenjoyed this video don't forget to likeitsubscribe see you next time
