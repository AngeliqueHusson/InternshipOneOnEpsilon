computing determinants can be reallycomplicated when you're dealing with 3by 3 determinants are higher and so youdefinitely want to be able to simplify adeterminant before computing it andthere are three rules that allow you todo sohere's the first with any determinantyou can factor a constant from a row orcolumn so for example here I've got alot of common factors in each of my rowstake a look at the last row I have acommon factor of 10 you can pull thatright out and put it in front so when Icompute this determinant instead I cancompute this simpler determinant andjust multiply the result by 10 you'llnotice I could actually factor more outI can factor 16 out of the top row thenI get 160 x + y and so on and so forthyou can keep doing that until yourdeterminate becomes nice and simple thesecond thing you could do you can add amultiple of one row to another and thesame goes for columns so for exampleyou've probably noticed before that welike to expand along rows or columnswith a lot of zeros well you can createmore zeros by cleverly adding multiplesof one row or column to another now herewhat I've done is I've multiplied thefirst column by four and added it to thethird column so this column is now fourtimes c1 plus c3 right four times 16 is64 add that this negative 64 when youget to zero and I did that to the wholecolumn now what's interesting about thisrow operation it's a column operation inthis case is that it doesn't change thevalue of the determinant you can alwaysadd a multiple of a row to another rowor a multiple of a column to anothercolumn and it doesn't change the valueand the third thing you can do isinterchange two rows or two columns sohere for example you know say for somereason I want to have this 0 on the leftI can just switch the first two columnsso these two columns have been switchedwhenever you switch two rows or twocolumns it changes the sign of thedeterminant so the three things you cando it would determine it to simplify ohone is you can factor a constant out ofany row or any column - you can add anymultiple of one row to another row andthe same goes for columns and three youcan interchange two columns or two rowsjust remember to change thiswhen you do that
