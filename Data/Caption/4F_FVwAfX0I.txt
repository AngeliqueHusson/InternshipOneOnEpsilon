Hey, this is Presh Talwalkar. I received this Mathcounts problem by email from Bill.Find all positive integers n for which n squared plus 45 is a perfect square.Can you figure it out? Give this problem a try and when you're ready to keep watching the video for the solution.Suppose n squared plus 45 equals a perfect square: x squared.We now subtract n squared from both sides of the equation to get 45 equals x squared minus n squared.We now can perform a little trick.We have the difference of two squares and we can factor that as the product of x plus n and x minus n.So we're looking for two factors of 45.The possibilities for this can be 45 times 1, 15 times 3, and 9 times 5.We now need to set the equations equal to these factors.Since x plus n is larger than x minus n, we will set x plus n equal to the larger factor.This is because x and n are positive integers.So from the first possibility we set x plus n to equal 45 and x minus n to equal 1.In the next possibility way of x plus n equals 15 and x minus n equals 3We then have x plus n equals 9 and x minus n equals 5.We can solve each of these equations for x and n.In the first set of equations, for example,we can add up the two equations to get that 2x is equal to 46,and then we divide by 2 to get x is equal to 23.We can then go back and solve that n is equal to 22.We'll use the same trick for the next two equations as well.We end up with x is equal to 9 and n equals 6 and then x is equal to 7 and n equals 2.So you know three possibilities n can equal 22, 6 & 2.And those are the only ways in positive integers that n squared plus 45 will be equal to a perfect square.Did you figure it out?Thanks for watching this video.
