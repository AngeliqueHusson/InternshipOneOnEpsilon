our definition like we talked about the median and our definition of that we call it the middle score but we said that's not the best way to describe it we would say that the median it's the number that divides up your set of data it divides the scores into a bottom half for the top half right in other words it divides them right down the middle into an equal set right so into two equal sections right yeah but alas top half and then the same size if the same number of people scores data points in both us and then we extended that we said well okay if you look at the bottom half and you look at the second half and you do this again right you get quartiles right so these are exactly the same in terms of dividing scores but instead of two equal sections you get oh there are Sarah there are three quarts I could figure out this right there's one median which gives you two sections live there are the three quartiles which gives you four sections does that make sense so four equal sections okay yeah they're four and you can sort a guess by the name right if you then extended this the game and said well what if I want a finer division of my set of Donna right des îles is not two equal sections or four equal sections but 10 equal sections now follow the pattern right there's only a single median there's a 3/4 else q1 q2 q3 how many deciles are there the desks are the dividers right to divide up something into ten you know so you need nine divided by wall between guys so there are nine decile so you might say there's one of these guys there's three of these guys and if there are none besides going on one last step the idea of a percentile okay you don't need me to tell you what this next one's going to be right you're going to divide all your scores into a hundred equal sections it's a very okay follow with me there are there's one median three quartiles nine deaths ask how many percentiles are they they're gonna die man okay so put your pants down and I want you to think with me right the way we would the way we would say - I would use this language is to say oh you guys are in the 97th percentile of saying you know household income now what does that mean don't write this down you just think about this sentence we mean you're in the now what that means is because we divided up all of your scores into 100 equal sections and you're on the 97th one right how much of the population is below you below I should come back to this guy right if I said you were on the first quartile right how much what percentage of the population is below you feel the first quarter use q1 right so I'd say you're on the first quartile right so that means 25% comes below you that makes sense if you're them like remember the quartile is not a section the quartile is a number right it's like you're right there and here are all the people beneath you if I said you're the median that means there's going to be 50% below you okay so now when you think about this how many people are below you okay good so what you've got here is a very fine way of describing where are you in proportion to everyone else okay now it was quite a bit of work to work out what a quarter are you going in order you know do all of this des îles and percentiles you will not be asked to calculate fine what these are is just too much work it programs with you know a spreadsheet will do this for us okay but you do need to do is to read and interpret these off a graph you've already been given okay so have a look at that piece of paper you have in front of you and on this thing looks weird now you'll need a ruler so what are you looking at let's just start with the easy things up what's the title of this graph okay cool so we're looking for BMI for you know 2 to 20 year old boys slash men ok have a look at the axes you've got over here on the left hand side that's the BMI going up okay and then on the bottom you've got age okay so how old are these people right so what I'm gonna do is um show you how to read this thing by trying to answer some of these questions right now just before I get to the first question these wiggly lines which seem to be like the important thing about it right what they represent you might talking about the 97th percentile before let's talk about the 95th because that's a talk top one over there okay I need a little bit more the graph there we go okay so let's picture let's start over here at age two okay if your BMI is here right that means so like 119 the heart or something like that okay I admit it's considerably want me to if you are at this BMI at this age that means you are the 95th percentile for BMI now thinking back to what this means this means that means that 95 percent of the population has a smaller BMI than you does that make sense so if you're the 95th percentile which comes all the way down to PR you have a very high BMI does that make sense no now the number for your BMI the expected number for your BMI it changes throughout your life right so for example where's the median which one of the look at the colors which one is the median the median is the 50th percentile right the meeting is the 50th percentile because that means 50% below and 50% above so it's this green one in here okay so you could say oh well like a normal person who's right in the middle of the bell curve they're gonna have this BMI over here according to their age okay does that make sense alright so now you have a rough idea let's go into the details the first question says and I'm you'll need your ruler for this and I only expect the reason I photocopy this as so you can draw all over this because you can't do it obviously with your textbook it says what is the BMI for twelve-year-old voids in the 85th percentile okay so have a look up ages across the horizontal axis right so I see table is there right now with your ruler then draw up a line that shows all of the BMI and percentiles for 12 year olds okay it should look something like this okay so the way I read this now is I say okay if I want to know what V for example what the median BMI of twelve-year-old boys is then I go as we were just saying to that um over there to that green line which is where the 50 is following and then I'm going to go all the way to the left and I'm going to read a number off okay so that's how I'm using this graph now I don't actually want the UM the 50th percentile I don't want the median what am i after for this question 85th so have a look from the top those curvy lines that's the third curvy line down right so um I'm gonna mark that in yeah and therefore I'm gonna go across all the way and it looks to me like that's a BMI of 21 by the way if you want to I mean only the boys can do it for this particular graph but if you want to position yourself just in case you can't remember BMI is weight divided by sin remember height squared and the hype has to be in meters okay all right so I've answered that first one the BMI for twelve-year-olds in the 85th percentile is 21 okay let's get going what percentage of 15-year olds have a body mass index that's less than seventeen point one so again I'm gonna go to my the relevant axis BM eyes are all on the left hand side listen out for because mr. Anderson will come so waste 17.1 on the left-hand axis 17.1 it's gonna be about there right you can see that in between all of those lines there's five lines in between in between each BMI unit so each one must be point two so I'm gonna go across to where 15 year-old boys are right which is if I draw my horizontal line it's gonna look something like this okay so 15 that's a vertical line so you can see it's going to be here a higher BMI means you have more mass in proportion to your height right so low BMI means I'm your tall skinny and a high BMI means the other thing you can go look it up it it also changes like this kind of thing doesn't take into account right yeah it doesn't take into account things like you know ethnicity matters and you know what what time period you've grown up in like just think about this right yeah that's right well you you aren't gonna factor into this like yes that's true so mass like muscles heavier weight that's right it's still in the ballpark but okay so what's my answer what have I got here what percentile am I on I'm on the tenth percentile all right so what percentage of 15 you guys have a body mass index that's less than seventeen point 110 now just before I leave this question what if I answer that asks that rather than the other direction if I'd said what percentage of 15 you boys have a body mass index that is greater than 17.1 what would be on top it would be it'd be everything above ten which is ninety percent of the population does that make sense so I've read a cross from seventeen point one over here and I've gone all the way across to 15 years old which is which is here now make sense oh yeah cause you know the line yep cool okay can you have a party without me help honey your hand have a go
