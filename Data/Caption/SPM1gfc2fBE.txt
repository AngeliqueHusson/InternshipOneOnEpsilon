in this video we're going to look at anexample that involves the exteriorangles of a triangle in this particularquestion we're given two of the exteriorangles and we must find the third itwould be helpful if we knew what theexterior angles of a triangle add up toso let's take a look if we take ourthree angles for our exterior angles ofthis triangle and we put them togetherwe might notice a relationship let'sgrab some of our angles and put themtogether to see what we getand as you can see putting these anglestogether we get a complete circle whichis equal to 360 degrees total sotherefore if I take away my angle of 150degrees and 95 degrees from 360 I shouldbe able to determine what X is so we canwrite this as an equation like so notingalso that the equation can be readwritten in several other forms includingthis one where all we've really done issimply brought our 150 or negative 150as well as our negative 95 to the otherside by using opposite operations andcomputing a hundred and sorry 360 minus150 minus 95 and we get 115 degrees forX
