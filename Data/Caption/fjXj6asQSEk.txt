[Music]so the channel has been getting a bitheavy lately so for this video I thoughtI would do something lighter and makesome fun animations involving gearshowever it occurs to me that typicallywhen you see drawings of gears you'llnotice that they're not drawn in a waythat an engineer might draw them inother words they don't mesh perfectlyand you can easily see that if you wereto actually make gears this way you'rethere be a lot of clanging and therewould not be a smooth transfer of motionfrom one gear to another now I dounderstand that a lot of times this isjust an aesthetic or an artistic choiceand if that's true that is perfectlyfine but let me show you how to do itthe more satisfying way firstimagine your unloop extreme from a rolltotleigh then the curve that the tip ofthe string will trace out is called aninvolute now we are interested in involutes because you can use them to drawa perfectly meshing gear teeth so let'ssay you start with two gears of twodifferent sizes and you don't know howto draw the teeth on them yet then whatI want you to do is draw evenly spacedin volutes coming off of the first gearjust depending on however many teeth youwant and then do the same thing comingagain off of the second gear and thenrepeat the process except this time flipthe string and also move your startingpositions depending on however wide youwant your gear teeth to be[Music]now using in volutes for gear teethprofiles is advantageous not onlybecause there is a smooth transfer ofmotion from one gear to another butyou'll notice the angle at whichpressure is being applied from one yearto another stays constant and the pointat which pressure is being applied movesat a constant speed which results in asituation where there's no sort ofunpredictable stress that is going fromone gear to the other and so you'll seethis methodology of gear constructionpop up everywhere even in places whereyou would least expect it to you mayhave noticed that with this method thelength of the gear teeth as well as theangle at which pressure is being appliedis completely determined by how farapart I put my gears which can at timesresult in some awkward looking gears nowyou can rectify the situation by keepingthe involute shapes but just elongatingthe gears at the base which is perfectlyfine but can at times result in asituation where you have the tip of onegear tooth cutting into the base ofanother gear tooth resulting in what arecalled undercuts now just a fewpractical notes number one really bigundercuts are undesirable because theyweaken the gear teeth number two youdon't want gears with very few teethbecause there's no guarantee that thenext tooth will engage before theprevious one is done and number threeyou might want to add some tolerancesjust so that there's a little bit ofbreathing room for your gears howeversince I am just drawing pictures youknow I'm not actually making any gearsI'm not going to worry about any of thisstuff now even with just two gears youknow no bells and whistles or anythingit is just so much fun to watch them fittogether as they rotatenow that we have the stuff in hand Ireally wanted to combine it with someother beautiful mathematics and I thinkwe're finally ready so today we'll betaking ideas from an artist named MC ashwhy Asher well so mathematicians andartists have their own conceptions ofwhat makes things beautiful but veryrarely do you find an artist that worksin the intersection in other words anartist that produces content that bothparties find intellectually satisfyingand meaningful or said another waywhat's interesting about Asher's work isthat there's either a deep mathematicalconcept or a fun math problem thatunderlies so much of it and this is truedespite the fact that the man had nomathematical training whatsoever now howdoes that work I don't really know butthat should not stop us from having somefun with itokay so this is the first piece we'regoing to carefully think about feel freeto pause if you'd like to look at itmore carefully so there's this reallyinteresting pattern where this person islooking at a picture and if you go allthe way around you'll find that he'salso a part of that picture somehow nowthis effect has been dissected andinterpreted to oblivion and I'm sureyou've seen similar paradoxical seemingartwork online in fact to Dutchmathematicians were able to work thisout carefully enough where they were notonly able to fill in that gap in theoriginal picture but reverse thetransformation to produce the originaldrawing now I'll link to the paper downbelow in case you want to read it but itturns out the idea is really not thatcomplicatedso I'm going to give you a simpleexplanation of it and then use it onsome gears okay so start with somepicture now we need to transform thispicture and to make things easier fornow let's focus on what thetransformation will do to the pixels inthis circle centered at the origin sothe transformation is to send everypoint to a new point where the Y valueis the angle that the point makes withthe origin and the x axis and the xvalue is the log of the distance to theorigin now this may look complicated butnotice that it will send this circle toa vertical line segment nowis true for every circle centered at theorigin they will all get sent tovertical line segments so the regionbetween two circles will get sent to arectangle also notice that thistransformation is reversible so you cantake this rectangle and send it back tothe region between two circles obviouslythis is not too exciting but what youcan do is rotate and rescale therectangle so that the diagonal is nowvertical and has a height of 360 so thatnow the diagonal gets sent to a circlenow if you do this before you reverseyou will get logarithmic spirals likethe kind that you see on Nautilus shellsor tropical storms now all you have todo is tile the rectangles and you willfill out the plane with spirals andthere you have it this is how you take apicture isolate the region between twocircles and then use this information tocreate a new picture with a spiralingpattern just as an aside it made senseto use the region between two circles inthis picture but you don't have to sofor example if I hand you something likethis you aren't going to want to usecircles you're probably going to want touse the region between these twotriangles and you can just perform thetransformation like you did before andyou won't get a rectangle you'll you'llget this goofy looking thing and you mayhave to be slightly more careful butjust tile and tilt before reversingsimilar to how we did before and onceagain you will get pretty spirallypictures now moving back to gears theprocess I just described is what I usedto get this picture now I think thislooks pretty cool however we can gofurther so take a look at these othertwo pieces by Asscher and you know onceagain feel free to pause if you'd liketo well it turns out with all the workwe've already done it's not too hard toreplicate this effect as well so startby taking the picture we've already madeand put it on a plane then place asphere right on top of the picture atthe origin then the first thing we aregoing to do is transfer our picture ontothefear using a method called stereographicprojection so for any point on the planeyou can draw from it a line segment tothe North Pole and if you do this itwill go through one point on the sphereand the way you do the transfer of theimage is you color the point on thesphere the same way the point on theplane was colored and if you do this forevery single point you'll transfer thewhole image onto the sphere notice bythe way that this is a two-way streetyou can use this method to transfer animage from a plane onto a sphere butalso from a sphere back on to a planewhich is precisely what we are going todo except before doing the transfer backwe are going to rotate this sphere firstand there you have it two spirals nowobviously we are not done yet becausethe whole point of doing this with gearsis that years are a lot of fun to watchwhen you rotate them so to put thecherry on top that is exactly what weare going to do nownow I think this is pretty amazing and Ihave to say every time I look at it I'mfilled with a mixture of confusion andamusement you can also do the same thingbut with smaller gears which wouldresult in this picture and just forkicks here's everything put together inone animationnow this is all very interesting but oneof the best things about digging deeperand understanding how something works isthat you can use that understanding totake things to the next level which isprecisely what we are going to do nowusing some complex numbers actually forthose of you in the know I'm sure you'venoticed that there's been a strongundercurrent of complex numbers that hasbeen running throughout this video thosetransformations from earlier I couldhave just as easily described them withconcepts like the complex logarithm andcomplex exponentiation and even thattransformation where I transferred thepicture from a plane to a sphere andthen back onto a plane after rotating itcould just as easily have been describedusing this complex function now I'm notgoing to get into the details herebecause that is not what this video isabout however there's one thing I wouldlike to point out if you've ever seen aplot of this function on the real lineyou will have noticed that it has a 0 at1 and an asymptote at minus 1 well oneinteresting way to think about thisimage is that it's kind of similar to acomplex plot of this function if youthink about it you start with a point Zand then you look at where it maps ontoan image via a certain function f andthen you color Z the same way and if youthink about it this way you quicklyrealize that these two spirals that arehappening at 1 and minus 1 are preciselya result of the fact that this functionhas a 0 at 1 and goes off to infinity atminus 1 now if you think from thisperspective you realize that takingthings to the next level it's just aseasy as realizing that this is just onecomplex function there's nothingstopping us from trying others so let mejust do one more example so let's startwith this animation which is a bunch ofthree toothin a hexagonal pattern and I'm going toadd some color in just because that'ssomething I haven't tried yet now I'mgoing to do everything I did earlierexcept at the very end instead of usingthis function I'm going to use this onenow this function has two points whereit goes to zero and two points where itgoes off to infinity so if I understandeverything correctly I should now getfour cool spirally patterns insteadjust to and indeed I do now I think thislooks pretty amazing on its own but onceagain we can add either rotationor motion now should probably stop herebecause frankly there is an infinitelandscape of things to try and I hopeI've whet your curiosity somewhat and ifI have please subscribe to the channelleave a like and maybe share this videowith someone who you think might enjoyit as well another thing I want tomention is that I'll be putting versionsof these animations that appeared inthis video on Twitter if you'reinterested you can follow me there peace[Music]
