there are many objects in geometry andin real life that have symmetry but howdo we define symmetry well an object hassymmetry if there exists an isometrycell reflection or rotation maybe even atranslation that maps the figure backonto itself if that isometry is areflection then a figure hasreflectional symmetry so another way ofthinking about reflectional symmetry isthat half of the figure is a mirrorimage of the other half we also describereflectional symmetry using the termline symmetry so those two areinterchangeable let's apply what we knowabout reflectional symmetry to somespecific examples here we're being askedto find the lines of reflectionalsymmetry which means what line could idraw on this pentagon so that I couldfold the pentagon back onto itself andhave an identical image well I see thatI could draw a line of reflection rightthere which would enable me to fold myPentagon over onto itself I could draw aperpendicular through each one of thesevertices perpendicular to the oppositeside for a total of five lines ofreflectional symmetry if we move on to asquare I see that I could dry in a lineof symmetry through the half of thesetwo sides and I could fold it I couldalso draw a horizontal line of symmetryI can also draw in some diagonal linesof symmetry and those would enable me tofold the figure back onto itself so thethis regular pentagon had five thesquare has four lines of symmetry whatabout an equilateral triangle well anequilateral triangle similarly I candraw this line through the vertexperpendicular to the opposite side and Icould draw in two more so an equilateraltriangle will have three linesreflectional symmetry if we look at nicesossel each triangle if I label thesetwo sides as being congruent there'sonly one line of symmetry because if Idrew in another line here it would notbe a mirror image of itself if we'retalking about a scalingtriangle well let's say we gave theseside lengths of 2 5 & 8 there are nolines of symmetry of reflectionalsymmetry of the scaling triangle so togo back over what exactly reflectionalsymmetry is is it's a more specificdefinition of symmetry where you canreflect half of the figure back ontoitself
