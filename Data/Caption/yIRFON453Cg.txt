welcome to my video on optimization inthis example we are given the demand andthe cost functions and what we need todo is find the number of units X whichproduces the maximum profit so let'stake a look at these two functions whichare given to us we'll start with thedemand function what this demandfunction is telling us is the price ofthe product that's why it's labeled withap the demand is the price of theproduct based on how many units X areavailable and notice the higher thevalue of x the lower the value of P isgoing to be which which makes sensebecause the higher the supply the lowerthe demand or the lower the price of theproduct is going to be so this demandfunction is just another way ofexpressing price so now let's take alook at the cost function the cost isrepresented by C C is equal to 1200 Xplus 2600 and notice how the higher thevalue for X the higher the cost is goingto be which makes sense the more unitsyou produce the higher the cost is goingto take to produce them so these are thetwo equations which we will be using inthis example so now let's take a look atall of these steps we need to use toperform an optimization problem so herewe have step number one step number onesays to find the equation to maximize orminimize so if we go back to our examplewe need to find the equation to maximizeor minimize so notice in this questionit says find the number of units X whichproduces the maximum profit so thisprofit is what we need to maximize sohow do we find the equation for profitwell if you use your natural intuitionyou know that the profit is equal to thetotal amount of money you receive fromselling a product minus the cost ittakes to produce thatproduct so here I wrote the equationdown for you the profit is equal to therevenue the revenue is just the totalamount of money you receive from sellingthe product minus the cost the cost toproduce that product which makes sensefor example if you have a product andyou sell the product for $50 so youreceived $50 in revenue but that sameproduct takes you 20 dollars in cost toproduce your profit would be the $50 inrevenue minus the $20 it cost you toproduce and so 50 minus 20 would be a$30 profit so you could use your naturalintuition to figure out how to find thisprofit equation so this profit equationis what we are trying to maximize andnow we are ready to move on to stepnumber two so step number two says toreduce this equation to one variable soif we go back to our example we need toreduce this profit equation in terms ofone variable at the moment it's writtenin terms of revenue and cost so firstlet's take a look at revenue like I saidearlier revenue is just the total amountof money you receive so if you have 10units of a product and you sell thatproduct for $5 a piece5 times 10 is equal to 50 so yourrevenue would be equal to $50 so therevenue is equal to the price of theproduct multiplied by the number ofunits sold so once again the revenue isequal to the price of the productmultiplied by the number of units sold Xall right so now let's pay attention inparticular to the price of the productand try to rewrite this in terms of Xwell we know from the demand equationwhich is another way of expressing pricethe price P is equal to 3000 minus 2x soin this profit equation we canplace the price with 3,000 minus 2x sonow we have rewritten the revenue interms of one variable X the revenue isequal to the price which is 3000 minus2x multiplied by the number of unitsthat are sold which is just X so nowlet's do this same exact thing for thecost let's try and rewrite the cost interms of one variable X so the cost isalready given to us in terms of X weknow the cost which is C is equal to1200 X plus 2600 so we can replace thecost with 1200 X plus 2600 come so thisrevenue which is being subtracted by thecost and once again the cost can bereplaced with 1200 X plus 2600 all rightso now we have written the profitequation in terms of one variable X thisprofit which I'll just label with acapital P since I'm running out of spacehere the profit is equal to 3000 minus2x multiplied times X and this is allbeing subtracted by 1200 X plus 2600 butbefore we move on to the next step let'ssimplify this profit equation just alittle bit further so the first thingI'm going to do is just distribute I'mgoing to distribute this X with thenegative 2x in the positive 3000 x timesnegative 2x is equal to negative 2xsquared and X multiplied times 3000 isequal to a positive 3000 X and now I'mgoing to do the same thing with theright side of the equation and we have anegative one even though there's no onethere there's an implied one always thenegative one is being multiplied with apositive 1200 X so that is equal tonegative 1200 X and notice how we havetwo like terms 3000 X and negative 1200X if we combine them 3,000 minus 1200 isequal to 1800 so I'm going tothese and replace them with a positive1800 X and now last but not least weneed to multiply this negative 1 with apositive 2600 which is equal to negative2600 so now we have simplified thisprofit equation as much as possible it'swritten in terms of one variable X andnow we are ready to move on to stepnumber three so step number three saysto find the critical values which meanswe need to take the derivative and setit equal to zero so if we go back to ourexample we need to take the derivativeof this profit function and set it equalto zero so the derivative of the profitwith respect to X is equal to thederivative of negative 2x squared whichis equal to negative 4x plus thederivative of positive 1,800 X which isjust equal to 1800 plus the derivativeof negative 2600 which is equal to zeroso this is our derivative with respectto X and we need to set it equal to zeroto find the critical values so now theonly thing we need to do is just solvefor X so this is an easy equation tosolve the first thing I'm going to do issubtract 1800 from both sides and on theleft side of the equation the positive1800 and negative 1800 cancel each otherout and we're left with negative 4x andthat is equal to the right side which iswhich is zero minus 1800 which is equalto negative 1800 now to get X by itselfwe can divide both sides by negative 4by both sides by negative 4 on the leftthe negative 4 is cancel each other outand we're left with X so X is equal tonegative 18 hundred divided by negative4 which is equal to a positive 450 soour critical valueX is equal to 450 and now we are readyto move on to step number four so stepnumber four says to verify if thecritical values are maximums or minimumsso if we go back to our example we needto verify if this critical value of 450is a maximum or a minimum or possibly itcould be neither so how do we test tosee if this is a max or a min what Ilike to do is the second derivative testso I'm going to perform the secondderivative test here on the right inblue now the first thing I'm going to dois just rewrite my first derivativewhich was equal to negative 4x plus 1800so the second derivative with respect toX is equal to the derivative of negative4x which is equal to negative 4 plus thederivative positive 1800 which is equalto zero so our second derivative isequal to negative 4 all right so now weneed to verify if this critical value of450 is a max or a min so to do this weneed to plug it into our secondderivative so if we plug 450 into oursecond derivative notice how our secondderivative is a constant it's negative 4so no matter what value for X you pluginto your second derivative it's alwaysgoing to be equal to negative 4 and ifyour second derivative is negative thatmeans your critical value is going to bea maximum this verifies that ourcritical value of 450 is indeed amaximum which is good because thequestion is asking us to find themaximum profit so this critical valuehad to be a maximum all right so now weare ready to answer our question it saysfind the number of units X whichproduces the maximum profit well we knowif X was equal to 450 that was ina maximum so 450 units is our answerthis is the number of units that if weproduce will produce the maximum profitso I hope this video gave you a betteridea on how to perform optimizationproblems there are many other exampleswhich are much different so that's why Imade four other optimization videos aswell the links for these videos are inthe screen and the description for eachexample that I use is in red so you cansee which example I use in the video sothank you so much for watching and Iwill see you in my next one
