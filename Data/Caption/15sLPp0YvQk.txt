Hello. I'm Professor Von Schmohawk
and welcome to Why U.In the last lecture, we explored
the dawn of number systems.These early number systems were concerned
only with numbers used to count objects.In mathematics, we call these counting numbers
the "natural numbers".The smallest natural number is 1and there is no limit
to the largest natural number.As we also saw in the previous lecturethere are many number systems which could
be invented to represent natural numbers.For instance, the Romans used
a natural number systemwhich by today's standards
seems quite complicated.In the Roman system,
the symbols I, V, X, L, C, D, and Mrepresent the quantities
1, 5, 10, 50, 100, 500, and 1000.The quantities 2 and 3
are represented by two or three I's.The quantities 6, 7, and 8
are represented by the symbol for five, Vfollowed by one, two, or three I's.And the quantities 4 and 9are represented by the symbols for 5 or 10,
V and X, preceded by an I.The numbers 10 through 100
follow the same patternexcept that the symbols X, L, and C
are used to represent 10, 50, and 100.The same pattern is used for
the numbers 100 through 1000.using the symbols C, D, and M
to represent 100, 500, and 1000.In addition, the symbol M
may be repeated up to three timesto represent 1000, 2000, or 3000.These groups of numerals can be combinedto form any number up to 3999.For example, this number is written asthree-thousandplus nine-hundredplus ninetyplus nine.The Romans rarely needed numbers
larger than this.When they did, they used the standard symbols
with a bar over themto indicate a value 1000 times greater.At first look, it seems like
it would be very difficultto do calculations using Roman numerals.For instance, take the following
simple addition problem.Using Roman numerals, this same problem
looks quite complicated.However, the Roman number system
is actually not all that different from oursif you think of groups of Roman symbolsbeing the equivalent to our
single numeric symbols.If we arrange the symbols into columns of
ones, tens, and hundredsthe two number systems
look a little more similar.The first difference that is apparentis that the Roman number system
had no symbol for zero.An even more important differenceis that our modern number system
uses the same symbolto represent different values
depending on its position in the number.For instance, in this problem, the number "2"
represents 2, 20, and 200depending upon which column the "2" is in.On the other hand, in the Roman system,
2, 20, and 200are represented by different symbols.The important difference between the Roman
number system and our modern systemis that in the Roman systemthe position of a symbol within a number
doesn't determine the value.Since symbols do not have to
fall into particular columnszeros are not needed as a column placeholder.Our modern number system is an example of
"positional notation".In positional notation, the same symbol
represents different quantitiesdepending on its position in the number.For example, the symbol "1" can represent
1, 10, 100, 1000, and so on.Consequently, the numbers 10, 100, and 1000require zeros as column place holders
following the one.The Roman number system is an example of
"sign-value notation".Sign-value notations
do not require a symbol for zerosince different quantities
such as 1, 10, 100, and 1000each have unique symbols whose value
does not depend on their position in the number.The natural number system used today,
with which most everyone is familiaris called the "decimal" or "base-10"
number system.In the next lecture
we will explore these numbersas well as other natural number systems using
other bases such as binary, octal, and hexadecimalwhich are often used when working with
digital computers.
