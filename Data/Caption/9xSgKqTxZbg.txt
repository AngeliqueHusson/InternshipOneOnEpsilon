so welcome to my video on ellipsesbefore I start an example I just want togo over some basic things that youshould know before you start doing anyhomework problems and I wrote for youtwo differentellipse equations one on the left andone on the right and notice in bothequations how we have a plus sign in themiddle of the equations so if you see anequation that looks like this and youdon't see a plus sign then it's not anellipse if there's a negative sign inthe middle then it's going to be inhyperbola so make sure you you look forthat whenever you are doing a homeworkexample and another thing I want to goover is notice how the a squared term ison the left side of both of theequations that's not necessarily gonnahappen all the time the a squared termis actually just the biggest number soyou have an a squared term and a bsquared term they're both in denominatorso whatever the bigger number is is youra squared and whatever the smallernumber is is your B squared so those arejust some basic things that I want totalk about before we start in ourexample so having said that I will getstarted right away here we have theproblem Y minus 1 squared over 9 plus Xminus 2 squared over 16 is equal to 1and notice how we have a plus sign inthe middle of this equation so we knowthat it's an ellipse and the first thingwe're going to do is we're going to findthe center of the ellipse all right weare going to find the center and thecenter is usually written in the form HK and H is the x coordinate of thecenter and the K is the y coordinate ofthe center so the H term is always thenumber next to X so notice how we have a2 next to this number X and it's alwaysthe opposite sign so since it is anegative 2 next to the X our H term isgoing to be a positive 2 and our K termis actually the number that's next tothe Y term since we have a 1 next to Yand it's a negative it's going to be apositiveso it's the number is always the sameand the signs always the opposite so wehave our center of our ellipse ourcenter is the coordinate to one so I'mgoing to plot that on our graph overhere so I'm going to go over to theright two units one two and I'm going togo up one unit so here we have thecenter of our ellipse which is the pointtwo oneall right so now that we have plottedour center now we need to find what ourvertices are so the next thing we'regoing to do is we are going to find ourvertices all right and I was talkingabout the numbers a squared + B squaredearlier those are our numbers in ourdenominator and those those numbers arevery helpful in telling us where ourvertices are so first thing we're goingto do is we are going to find our asquared term and like I said before thea squared is always the bigger number inthe denominator so we have a number 9 inour denominator on the left and we havea number 16 on the number in ourdenominator on the right so 16 is abigger number so our 16 is going to beour a squared all right and in order tofind our a we can just take the squareroot of a squared so a is equal to thesquare root of 16 which is just 4 so thereason why this number is so helpful infinding our vertices is because a is thedistance between the center of ourellipse and the vertices so the distanceof 4 is the distance between the centerand the vertices so let's go to ourcenter but we don't know which directionit goes is is the vertices 4 units tothe right is the vertices 4 units up anddown so we don't know that so I'm goingto explain how we know which directionthe vertices so what I like to do tofind out which direction I need to go isI look where our a squared term is our asquared term is under the x value noticethat we have an X innumerator and our a squared term isunder the x value so since our a squaredterm is under the X value I know thatthe vertice is going to be 4 units inthe X direction so the X Direction goesparallel at the x axis so that means itgoes right and left all right so I knowthat our vertices are going to be 4units in the X direction so we have 1 23 4 there's one vertice make a big dotand we also have another versity that is4 units to the left we have 1 2 3 4 theuniversity over here and I'm just goingto erase these dots that I wrote in themiddle so now that we've plotted thepoints so we actually we actually canfind out what the actual coordinates ofthe vertices are so the vertices on theleft goes over to the right 1 2 3 4 5 6units and it goes up one unit so we knowthat this is the point six one and thevertice to the left that goes over tothe left one two units and then it goesup one unit so we know that this is thepoint negative 2 positive 1 alright sonow let's plot our other two vertices wecan use our b squared term to help uswith that our b squared term is going tobe our smaller number in the denominatorwhich is our number 9 so we know sinceour b squared is equal to 9 then b canbe found by taking the square root ofthatso our b is equal to the square root of9 which is equal to 3 and once againsince our b squared term is under oury-value notice how our b squared whichis 9 is under our y-value then we knowthat our b is going to go in they-direction so our B is 3 units from thecenter in the Y direction so let's go toour Center the Y Direction is up anddown so I'm going to go up 3 units 1 2 3I'm gonna go down 4 units 1 2 3and now we have plotted our vertices inthe y-direction and once we plot themthen we can find out what the actualcoordinates are come for the vertices onthe bottom we go over one two units andthey go down one two units so that isthe point positive 2 negative 2 and forour vertice on the top we go over 1 2units and they go up 1 2 3 4 so that isthe point positive to positive 4 allright so now that we've plotted ourvertices now we can make a rough sketchof our ellipse which usually looks likea oval-shapedI'm a really bad artist though so Iapologize try and do my bestall right so now we have graphed ourellipse and the last thing that we needto do is we need to plot our foci allright so the thing that we use to findthe distance from the center to our fociis our C squared and we have a formulato find our C squared value our Csquared is going to be equal to asquared minus our B squared and if youhave trouble memorizing this formula theway I like to think about it is Csquared is equal to our bigger numbersquared minus our smaller number squaredokay so once again our a squared is ourbig number and it's our 16 a squaredminus B squaredonce again our B squared is a smallernumber the denominator which is 9 so ourC squared value is equal to 16 minus 9which is equal to 7 so if our C squaredis equal to 7 we can find our value of Cby taking the square root of that so Cis equal to the square root of 7 thesquare root of 7 is somewhere betweenthe square root of 4 which is 2 and thesquare root of 9 which is 3 so it's inbetween 2 & 3 a little bit closer to 3so the value I would say is just alittle bit less than 3 all right so I'mgoing to plot these points on the on ourgraphso once again our C is the distance fromthe center of our ellipse to the fociall right so which direction do we needto go it's always in the same directionof our a or it's in the same directionof the longer axis of our ellipse onceyou can tell that this is the longer ofthe axis of our ellipse we have onegoing in the X direction which is muchlonger than the one going in the Ydirection so we know that the C value isgoing to go in the X direction sinceit's the longer or it's since it'slonger than the in the y direction soonce again square root of seven is alittle bit less than three so I'm goingto go to the right of the center alittle bit less than three units one twothree and I'll go a little bit left soit's a little because it's a little bitless than three and then I'm also goingto go to the left a little bit less thanthree units one two three a little bitless and now we have plotted our focialright so the exact value of thesepoints since if you need to write downan exact coordinate we know that thecenter is at the distance or is at the xcoordinate too and we know that thisfoci is the square root of seven unitsto the right of that so I'm gonna addsquare root of seven to that too for thex coordinate and then our y coordinatejust is you can is just one because itgoes up one unit and for this foci onthe Left we know that the center of theellipse is at 2 and that foci is squareroot of 7 units to the left of thecenter so we can subtract the squareroot of 7 from that and then our ycoordinate is just up one unit so our ycoordinate is just 1 so I hope thisvideo gave you a better idea of anellipse of how to graph it and to findall the important points on it I will bemaking videos on hyperbolas andparabolas as well so if I haven'talready made them stay tuned and untilmy next video I will see you later
