did humans just make up mathematics asin our prime numbers just a figment ofour collective imagination or do theyreally exist separate from our humanminds to start here's a fairly simplemath statement the Goldbach conjecturesays that every even number is the sumof two primes a prime number is onethat's only divisible by itself and onelike 2 3 5 7 11 13 17 and so onfor example 6 is not prime because it'sdivisible by 2 and 3 so the Goldbachconjecture says that every even numberis a prime number plus another prime forexample 4 is 2 plus 2 8 is 3 plus 5 20is 7 plus 13 and so on prime numbers aredefined by and principally aboutmultiplication and division but the goldthought conjecture is about what happenswhen you add them that's part of what'sweird about the Goldbach conjecture andmathematics in general humans pick howto define mathematical objects but thenthose objects take on a life of theirown and have properties and behaviors wedidn't intend this throws into questionwhether or not math exists independentlyof the human mind in the case of theGoldbach conjecturewe picked the definition of prime numberand then their relationship with evennumbers just sort of sprung up in thisway mathematics can feel like you wrotethe first page of a book and then you'refiguring out the rest nobody had towrite the next page it just sort ofunfolds like you're tapping into a storythat was already written which isstrange and what gets even strangerabout the Goldbach conjecture is that inthe nearly 300 years since theconjecture was formulated nobody hasever proved it computers have testedeven numbers up to this huge number andthey've always been able to find twoPrime's that addto the even number but mathematiciansdon't have a proof that it holds for alleven numbers and this points tosomething really important about mathmath isn't like science where you gainenough evidence and declare somethingtrue you have to have a precise logicalproof in this sense mathematics is aboutperfect knowledge individualmathematicians may make logical mistakesbut whole mathematical theories aren'tdisproven the way they are in sciencemathematical knowledge just accumulatesrather than revises itself but what isall this knowledge about well it's aboutmathematical objects like prime numbersand numbers are weird objects in factthere's a serious debate about whethernumbers even exist you can't see ortouch them which makes them seem sort ofmade-up but unlike most fictions numbersnever change you can make up new rulesfor checkers but two plus three isalways going to be five and besides ifnumbers don't really exist how come wecan use them to construct skyscrapersthat don't fall over let's move awayfrom prime numbers and try to answerthese questions with anothermathematical object the circle in schoolyou probably learned that pi is theratio of the circumference to thediameter of a circle this statement isnot about a real circle real circleshave defects and while the number pi isinfinitely precise any real measurementhas a limited amount of precision soactually pi is the ratio of thecircumference to the diameter of aperfect circle this fact about thedefinition of pi seems simple enough butthere are actually two very differentways to interpret it the first option iscalled realism a realist would say thatthere is some fixed idealized circle andall mathematicians throughout all ofspace and time are talking about theproperties of that circle pi is theratio of the circumference to thediameter of that circlerealists think that the objects thatmathematicians study are real reallyreal and exist independently of thehumans that think about them so aperfect circle exists just like a watermolecule or the planet Jupiter existsone version of this is called platens asin the ancient Greek philosopher Platoand his idea of platonic forms there's aform of a circle and all circular thingsin the physical world embody that formbut mathematicians aren't studyingphysical circles they're studying theplatonic form of a circle just aschemists study molecules andastrophysicists study planets here'swhat's great about realism it alignswith the way people feel while doingmath it positions mathematicians asinvestigators of sorts they're likeexplorers in a sea of numbers and shapesand ideas it's how actual mathematicianstalk but Platonism leads to a bigproblem where does our knowledge ofthese forms come from actual explorerslearn by physical interactions when NeilArmstrong famously described the surfaceof the Moon he was relying on his senseslike touch and sight photons werebouncing off the moon into his eyeballsbut when Goldbach saw the connectionbetween even numbers and primes it'shard to believe he was literallyinteracting with the Platonic forms ofthe numbers if numbers or a perfectcircle exists how do we access them tolearn about them this question isirritating enough that many philosophersof math have taken the opposite approachanti-realism let's go back to our factabout pi Chi is the ratio of thecircumference to the diameter of acircle the anti-realist would say thatmathematicians just made up the rulesfor being a circle and are drawing outthe consequences of those rules oneversion of this is called formalismsort of equates mathematics with a gamelike chess mathematicians are playingout the rules of the game it's dependenton the human minds that created itwhat's great about formalism is that itsolves the problem of Platonism we knowthings about math because we made up therules we don't have to look anywhereelse the problem in treating math likeit's completely made up is whatmathematician Eugene Wigner described asthe unreasonable effectiveness ofmathematics in the Natural Sciences mathis robust and an amazingly preciselanguage to describe everything fromquantum mechanics to the stock marketit's hard to imagine that a game soaccurately describes reality knowing therules of chess doesn't help scientistslaunch rockets into space but knowingmath does that's part of why it's sodifficult to understand what math ismathematician Reuben Hirsch wrote thatthe working mathematician is a plateinist on weekdays a formalist onweekends at the end of the day mostmathematicians this one included ourcontent just mapping it mathematicianslove their subject it's beautiful andmysterious abstract yet concretelydescriptive whatever it is which camp doyou fall into let us know in thecomments and we'll see you next week oninfinite series
