Think about this real
world problem.To estimate the population of a
town in upcoming years, oneof the town workers collected
populations from past yearsand made this table.So they have years starting
with 1950 and going up byincrements of 10 years.And they just figure out the
population of the town in eachof those years.The town wants to estimate
the population for2015, 2018, and 2020.To do this, will you be using
inductive reasoning ordeductive reasoning?Now before answering that, let's
just think about whatinductive reasoning is and what
deductive reasoning is.Inductive reasoning is looking
for a pattern orlooking for a trend.So it's looking for a trend
or a pattern and thengeneralizing.You could imagine, it's kind
of extrapolating theinformation you have,
generalizing.Deductive reasoning is taking
some set of data or some setof facts and using that to
come up with other, ordeducing some other, facts
that you know are true.When you generalize you don't
know necessarily whether thetrend will continue, but
you assume it will.You don't know 100%
it'll be true.With deductive reasoning,
you know it'll be true.You're starting with facts.And then you're deducing other
facts from those facts.Other facts that you
know are true.Now, when the town is
estimating, and that's kind ofa clue that they're not going
to know the exact populationfor 2015, 2018, and 2020.But when they estimate the
population for these years,these years are in the future.They don't know what
the populationwill be in those years.The best they can do is see
the trend of growth here,maybe see what percentage it's
growing every 10 years.Or what the absolute number of
growth is every 10 years.And maybe they can continue
that trend out to2015, 2018, and 2020.So they'll be looking for trend
in growth over this60-year period.And then they'll generalize
it out to these years.So this will be inductive
reasoning.
