In 1832, mathematician, Carl Gauss,and physics professor, Wilhelm Weber,designed a system which allowed them to communicateat a distance while they worked on their experiments 每connecting the observatory with the physical laboratory.They solved a really important problem,which was more of a puzzle:how to send all letters of the alphabetusing one circuit 每 or a line.And their system used a galvanometer,since it was known that electric current, passing througha coil, creates a magnetic field pointing throughthe center of the loop, which could deflect a needle.But instead of merely moving a needle at a distance,their system used a switch which could reversethe direction of current instantly.This would cause the magnetic fieldaround the coil to reverse,and the needle would deflect either to the right or left,depending on the direction of current 每thus, giving them two different signaling events 每or 'symbols' 每 right or left deflection.Most importantly, he assigned shortersymbols for the most common letters.[For instance,] 'A' was a single right deflection.And 'E' was a single left deflection.And he used the longer codes for less common letters,such as 'K,' which was three right deflections.And at the time, the speed of transmissionwas around nine letters per minute.All the needle telegraphs which followedsuffered from a similar limitation 每and it was an engineering problem.The 'signaling rate' was slow.Now the the signaling rate was thenumber of deflections per minutewhich could be accurately transmitted and received.And if you squished signaling events together,the receiver would get confused, due to jitter 每resulting in errors 每similar to how sustained notes on a piano will bleedtogether and become less recognizable 每 if you play rapidly.And over time, the signaling ratewas incrementally improved.One improvement was to adda small permanent magnet to the outside of the coil.This helped pull the needle back toneutral position, after each deflection.And these designs led to a wide range ofneedle telegraphs, which were deployed across Europe.The Electric Telegraph Companywas the first public telegraph company.It was formed, in 1846, after its owners purchasedthe key needle-telegraph patents at the time.But the speed of these various needle telegraphsnever surpassed around 60 letters per minute 每as each needle couldn't signal much faster thanone deflection per second.And initially, the company billed customersbased on single messages 每which could hold up to twenty words 每which is about the length of a 'tweet.'And by 1848, the cost of sending a single messagefrom London to Edinburgh was sixteen shillings.And this was around one week's salary for, say,a shop owner at the time.So this technology was initiallyout of the [reach] of common people.In the United States, the commercialization of the telegraphwas led by a portrait painter, named Samuel Morse,who had followed developmentof the needle telegraphs in Europe.Morse is important. because he focused onspeeding up the rate at which letters could travel.He did away with needles.And in [1838], he initially submitted a patentbased on the idea that electric currentcould either flow or be interrupted 每and interruptions could be organized to create meaning.Though his designs on how to produce these interruptionswere complicated 每 involving a convoluted system ofgears, levers and electromagnets.However, his system was greatly simplifiedafter his collaborations with Albert Vail.This led to an iconic piece of user interface 每the simple spring-loaded lever 每 or 'key' 每which could be controlled with the tap of a finger.And on the receiving end was a spring-loaded leverthat could be pulled and releasedby a strong electromagnet.To create a difference akin to the left-right deflection,he varied the length of a key press, or the pulse width.The closure of a switch for a very short timewas called a 'dot.'And the dot can be thought of asthe basic unit of time in Morse code.And the closure of the switchfor three units of time represented a 'dash.'[SOUND OF LETTERS BEING SENT BY MORSE CODE.]Spacing exactly right.Very small, tight spaces betweenthe dits and dahs in a character.Didah dit.[LETTER BEING SENT BY MORSE CODE.]Didah dit dit.[LETTER BEING SENT BY MORSE CODE.]And this was the source of differencein their coding strategy.Starting with an initial dot or dash 每 left or right branch 每which then leads to another dot or dash, and so on.And the scheme assigned shorter symbol sequencesto more probable letters 每based on the letter frequencies 每which could be tabulated from books.So nodes high up in the tree 每such as a single dot 每 represented 'E.'A single dash represented 'T.'And as we move down the tree,we place less common letters.And after a letter, this system inserts a three-unit pause.Spacing between the characters in a word or groupis uniform too 每 but longer.[LETTERS BEING SENT BY MORSE CODE.]It's important to realize that the meaning of these messageswas intertwined with the timing [used when sending] them.Are you wondering if proper spacingis really so important?Or is it no more than an extra refinement 每a nice thing to do 每 like neat handwriting?If you think so, you're wrong. And I'll show you why.[LETTERS BEING SENT BY MORSE CODE]Dit for dit, and dah for dah, they match.Only the spacing makes the differencebetween one word and the other.So to send the word 'Paris,'we would first need to think of it as'P [space] A [space] R [space] I [space] S.'The signaling rate of this system was directly relatedto the tempo of the signal.And music analogies were used inside training videos.What he was sending was standard test word: 'PARIS.'And there you are.Each peak is a dit 每 or a dah.Each valley, a space.This is excellent sending. Uniform and rhythmic.This is an example of poor hand sending.Same word: 'PARIS.' But look at the difference.Irregular dits and dahs. Haphazard spacing.No uniformity. No rhythm.Amazingly, it was the simplicity of this keying systemwhich made it much fasterthan any of the buttons and cranksemployed by the needle telegraphs in Europe.The letter rate jumped to 135 letters per minute 每or more, with trained operators.And on May 24th, 1844, the first successful transmissionwas the message, "What hath God wrought?"And the next day, it was reported by the New York Tribunethat, "The miracle of annihilation of spaceis at length performed."Consider that, at the time, 90% of messageswere still transported by horseback.Immediately, this technology was becoming criticalto the success of [the] military, newspapers,financial traders, crime-fighting [organizations, etc.].Any business that relied on informationnow relied on the telegraph 每 and Morse code.By 1900, the prices had droppedto 30 cents per message 每 as traffic surgedto over 63.2 million messages sent that year.As people begin using this system, they naturallythought of ways to save money.This led to popular code books thatmapped words to common sentences.For example, 'Blade' would actually mean'Please name and reserve, for myself and family,the following accommodations.'The telegraph companies frowned upon this,as they were happily charging people to be verbose.More letters equals more profit.It was now clear that information was an elastic term.A specific meaning was needed.An obvious question remained unanswered.If you are [charging to transmit] information 每no matter the system 每how should you [charge] to be fair to everyone?Number of letters 每 as a measure of information 每would no longer suffice.
