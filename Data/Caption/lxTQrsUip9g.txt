We're told to graph the
inequality y is lessthan 3x plus 5.So you give me any x, y is going
to be less than 3 timesthat x plus 5.So the way to think about it is
you want to think about theline y equals 3x plus 5, but
since we're going to be lessthan that, instead of drawing
the line, we're going to drawit as a dotted line and then
shade all the y's that areless than that.So let me show you
what I mean.So if we wanted to just draw 3x
plus 5, if this was just anequality, if we wanted to draw
that graph-- I'll do it inthis dark green color-- we'd say
OK, the y-intercept hereis positive 5.So we'd go 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.And we'd say the slope is 3,
which means if we move 1 inthe x direction, we move up 3.If we move back in the x
direction, we're goingto move down 3.If we move back 2, we're
going to go down 6.2, 4, 6, just like that.Now, if this was graphing the
line y is equal to 3x plus 5,we would just connect
all of these dots.But because we're not less than
or equal to, we're justless than, we're going to do a
dotted line here to show thatthe line is actually not
going to be included.So let me draw a dotted line
here, which is actuallysurprisingly easier to draw
than a regular line.So that is a dotted line.We're not going to include
that line, we're going toinclude all the y's that are
less than 3x plus 5.So let's think about
it for second.If you give me some arbitrary
x, so let's say that x is 0.If x is 0, then what's
3x plus 5?Well, 3 times 0 plus 5 is 5.So y is going to be
less than that.If x is 0, y has to
be less than 5.So y is going to be all of
these values down here.And it would not include-- and
if you were doing it as anumber line, you would do a
circle over there-- you wouldnot include 5.If x was equal to 1,
what is 3x plus 5?3 times 1 is 3, plus 5 is 8.So y would have to be less
than 8, 8 is over here.So it's all the values less
than eight over here.So in general, for any x over
here, the y's that are lessthan 3x plus five are
all of the valuesbelow the dotted line.All of these values below the
dotted line is the graph ofthe inequality y is less
than 3x plus 5.If it was less than or equal
to, you would make that asolid line.But it's not, so it's just all
of this area down here.All of this area below this
line, that's what that lessthan tells you.
