[Music]welcome back to yay math org with yaymath in studio I'm Robert of dudes withmy good friend Zach behind camera andtoday we're going to be talking aboutoperations with polynomials this stuffis a little weird if you don't knowwhat's going on but the second you seeit it's just gonna click right intoplace and that's my hope for you thatwhen you see it it's just gonna makesense so let's just jump right in thefirst I guess concept that this sectiontries to teach in the books is thisconcept of degree alright so degreebasically is the highest value of theexponent that's all that is so if youhave something like X to the fourththat's degree four in this case we lookthrough this entire polynomial we're notmultiplying anything we're onlysubtracting so this would be a degreetwo over here sometimes you havesituations like this and then you're ona fourth this would be degree sevenactually when you multiply these twoterms even though they don't combine thepower of the exponents culminate in thepower of seven so this will be degreeseventh this would be degree four onceyou understand degree just keeping inthe back of your mind for futureproblems which we're gonna do in theother videos okay let's learn how toconquer this particular polynomial inwhich they have us subtract these two sopretty much when we're adding orsubtracting or combining like terms theimportant thing to keep in mind is it'ssort of like we're subtracting thiswhole thing which means negative onedistributes to all three terms in otherwords all three signs will change insideit's called distributing the negative solet's go ahead and do thatthis would results in negative x squaredplus 2x minus 10 and then over here werealized that the parentheses serve nopurpose so we can just take them off 3xsquaredplus 2 X minus 7 and combine those uplike terminologies combining like termsjust go through it 3x squared and minusx squared results in 2x squared 2x plus2x is 4x negative sin you have a 7negative 7 and negative 10 not negativesin negative zebb to be like everythingnot negatives n negative 7 and negative10 we minus 17 pretty much itdistribute the negative through otherproblems we'll have a plus here noproblem you just add all the like termsok not everyone would be so not everyproblems so friendly sometimes they haveas multiplying polynomials we're gonnado that now so 2x minus y cubedoh the temptation to just bring in thecube to 2x and negative Y oh people loveit I'm gonna put a big fat non equal tohere people think it's 2x times 2x times2x which would be 8x cubed negative Ytimes negative Y times negative Y itwould be minus y cubed and it's wha-whadoesn't work that way we have tomultiply these binomials together so tovisualize that we have to write themside by side I'm going to start with twoof them two out of the three okay let'stake this take this off no wah wah vibesno what wives no all our lives 2x minusy 2x the - why people call this foilfirst outer inner lastbasically it's distributive property the2x will multiply by 1/2 and then whenwe're done the negative Y will multiplyby 1/2 let's go ahead and do that 2xtimes 1 - 2 x times 2x is 4x squaredthen you have 2x times negative Y isnegative 2xy then you have this negativeY times these two that's again negative2xy and then you have minus y squarednope plus y squared minus 10 months plusit's important lesson right to not beafraid to make mistakes that comes withthe territory fact there's a researchthat says that making mistakes is theonly way that our brains can growbelieve this Stanford Research so wecan't be afraid to make mistakes becausethat's the only way our brains will getbigger and bigger by now my brain mustbe enormous because I make mistakes allthe time let's combine like terms inhere 4x squared negative 2xy negative 2X Y is minus 4 X y plus y squared okit's problems halfway done because wehave one more 2x minus y to go now we'rewelcome to write it to the left or theright of this thing all right fromexperience I've noticed that writing itat the front is a little smootherexplain why ok let's make a little spacefor ourselves take this off okay bringthis up just as a note I do I have hadstudents before that like to writereally small and they think they'resaving paper or something like that andI remember my dad when I used to do thatwhen I was a kid he'd be like use paperand he would say like your education isworth it that's what you would say sodon't be afraid to really stretch outand write it large and in charge youreducation is worth it as long as you'reusing the paper to help you learn thenthat's what it's for right we're notadvocating to waste any paper but youreally want to spread it out on the pageso it minimizes mistakes and it's not asstressful ok so you'll notice I'm tryingto write it really big for myself aswell or just use white boards okay herewe godistributive property 2times 1 2 3 I'm gonna do it 2x times 4xsquared is 8x to the power of 3 cubed 2xtimes negative 4 X Y is negative 8xsquared Y that's these two and then youhave 2x times y squared is 2x y squaredplus 2x Y squared all right half donenow we're gonna keep an eye on negativeY times those 3 all right here they goI'm going to do that in blue actuallynegative Y times 4x squared is negative4x squared Y some students write it allout on the line you're welcome to dothat all right I'm going to show you acool stacking technique to help you keeptrack of all of the like terms so againthis would be negative 4x squared Ythat's right here minus 4x squared Yit's kind of cool so ready to add downand then you have negative Y timesnegative 4 X Y that'll be over here plus4 X Y squared and then we have negativeY times positive y squared that'snegative Y cubed it's out here all rightand then we're just gonna add down andthis problem is complete nice 8 X cubedminus 12x squared y plus 6x y squaredminus y cubed all right so basically itwas the first two things that we saidabove the first in the last and thismiddle action okay so don't forget thatwhen you're squaring or multiplyingbinomials two terms to write them outand distribute them through all rightthank you for watching this is Robertfrom the a mass org and we'll see youagain bye[Music]
