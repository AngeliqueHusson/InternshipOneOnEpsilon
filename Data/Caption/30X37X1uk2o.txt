g'day and welcome to the tech mathChannel but me having a look at in thisvideo is a very special video we'regoing to be looking at how to multiplymentally how to multiply big numbersmentally so bear with us you might lookat the parts wouldn't they say hey I cando this much faster with a pen and paperbut this isn't about two on a multipliedwith a pen and paper this is actuallytrying to get you eventually multiplyingmentally which is where the real artchallenge lies a lot of the time okay soI want to start this off with an examplelet's say I get you doing this one whatis our a nice easy one to start off with3021 and we're going to times it bythree so the answer that you should getfor this is nine thousand and sixtythree did you get that answer you knowwhat I reckon you probably did and I'llshow you how I reckon you probably gotthat how I think you probably got thatokay I would expect the way you've donethat is you would do this because you'redoing this a written method you would goone times three is three two times threeis six three times nothing is nothingthree times three is nine okay now lookthat's nice and easy if you're doing iton paper but it does become a little bitharder all of a sudden when you're notable to actually see the numbers okayand in a second I'm going to actuallyI'll give you one without the numbersthen I'll actually write it down andwe'll work through how your mind mightwant to get reprogrammed because I dothis slightly differently instead whatwe tend to do is we tend to work outquestions this way from right to leftwhereas what we actually when we thinkof numbers we actually think about themthis way okay we don't think about thisnumber being three and sixty and ninethousand we think about this is ninethousand and sixty three and this is thechallenge with multiplying mental is toturn the way around that you currentlywork your multiplication so you thinkabout them in the way that you actuallythink about them okay in that particularway rather than actually working againstthe way your mind naturally wants towork okay so the way that I would dothis is a little bit different and thisis what I mean with how we would have tochange the way that we arework we do this we times this by threebut instead what we would do is we wouldgo three times three is nine zero threetimes two is six three okay and we'reactually working this in the way that weactually you know you that you think thenumber okay I'll give you anotherexampleso I'll rub this out and then I'm goingto ask you for example to work out whatis our fifty-one thousand two hundredand thirty one times three okay so it'squite hard if you are if you're not usedto doing in that direction so the answerby the way is one hundred and fiftythree thousand six hundred and ninetythree okay let's uh I'll write that downso let's want to write the question downfirst fifty 1231it was times three so the way we do itis this three times five is fifteen weput that down so we're going from leftto rightfive times three is fifteen three timesone is threetwo times three is six three times threeis nine1 times 3 is 3 you see where we'reworking this way and this is the trickto mental calculations mentalmultiplication so I know it's going tohappen I'm going to start gettingprobably comments people saying this isharder this is not what I'm used tobecause it's not what you used to butthen again you also might realize thatthe method you're used to is no good formental multiplication so this is doestake a bit of practice but this is theway to do it mentally this is well oneother ways to do it mentally so I'mgoing to give you a another one now whatabout we deal with our hopefully dopretty good with this what about we do adifferent one here what about we dosomething say like a sixty 1413 I'llwrite that number down 60 1413 and we'lltimes that number bye for now from nowon rather than saythem I'm going to actually you know sowithout actually writing down you mightgo 4 times 6 is 24 1 times 4 is 4 thenthe 16 way to see how you're going todeal with this carry here what you say Idon't even know what just went on I willexplain to you slowly what the problemwill be here ok so when we're doing thiswe have a bit of a problem because whatwe do is we go 6 times 4 is 24 1 times 4is 4 4 times 4 is 16 wait a second thatmeans we're going to have to carrysomething so I'm going to put the 6there and we're going to carry the 1 sothis is going to become a 5 1 times 4 is4 and then 3 4 to 12 so 2 is going to gothere and the one's going to get carriedacross and that will also become a 5now the carrying all of a sudden canbecome a bit of a problem when we talkabout mental calculation becausecarrying numbers in your head tends tothrow things a little bit what we tendto have to do is we have to carry as wego but we also have to start doing thislittle thing which I call pre carryingokay it just involves glancing at thenext part of your answer to to work outwhat what your current answer will beI'll show you what I mean by thisokay then we'll go through a couple ofexamples with this so say for example Ido our this one here 30 1616 and I timesthis number by 4 okay I work through howthis concept of pre carrying works sofirst off we do this 3 times 4 and weget the answer of 12 but before I writethen 12 I look at the next part of theanswer and I go 1 times 4 the answer isbelow 10 I'm not going to have to carryanything so I can put down more 12 if Idid have to carry something I'd carriedacross and put that as part of my answerand you'll see how I'm on this one rightnow1 times 4 is 4 so I'll quickly look atthe next part in 6 4 2 24 24 I'm goingto have to carry this too ok so this iswhat I'm going to pre carry only precarried across so 1 times 4 is 4 plusthat 2 from the next part it's going tobe 6okay all right we'll see how we go withthat so the next one was six times fouris twenty-four we've already writtendown that two then we pre carried thatthe number afterwards is one times fourwe're not gonna have to carry anythingacross so I can just put down at fourokay for our one times four I'll look atthe next part okay and that's 6 times 4is 24 I'm going at the pre carry twoacross okay so 1 times 4 is 4 plus 2 is6 ok did you get that and then the lastpart well that's just going to bewhatever that unit's part was going tobe you know in 64 for 24 so that's awith that 4 goes down but this is theconcept of pre carrying okay and it's athe biggest part of this trick is to beable to get the pre carry right ok wecan get the pre carry right you'rereally on the way to getting thesementally are correct so what about I'llgive you another exampleok we'll write this one down what aboutfor instance 20 1613 and we times thatby 5 okay I'm just going to make sureI'm going to get some numbers where weare going to have to carry and pre carrythings across ok so first off what we dogoing from left to right 2 times 5 is 10now we look at 1 times 5 no pre carry soI can put down my 10 okay Oh put alittle tick there to show that's whereI've done it ok 1 times 5 ok that'sgonna be 5 and I'm gonna have to precarry 6 times 5 30 I'm at the pre carry3 ok with 6 times 5 is 30 I had to precarry 3 so 1 times 5 is 5 plus 3 okay isgoing to be highall right take that one off six timesfive is thirty I've already pre carriedthat three so I got that 0 and then 1times 5 I'm not gonna have to pre carryanything so with that I can put down thezero from the 30 think I've already precarried the three that one done 1 times5 is 5 then I look at the next one 3times 5 is 15 I'll add to pre carry youguessed it 1 okay because 3 5 2 59 ifthe pre carry the one off the 15 so 5plus 1 is 6okay and then what I do is I put downthat last bit which was that 5 how didyou go with that did you get that answerdid you get 100 9065hopefully you'll be able to actually arestart seeing how to do this it's all amatter of working out the pre carry okis it easy at the start no this doesrequire practice and what I'd recommendis you would start with smaller numbersto start off with okay you would startwith say somethingI like the and something like arepossibly you know what about 423 andwe're going to times that by 4 okay sothat's a good one because it's a nicethree-digit it's not too huge 4 times 4is 16 2 times 4 is 8 so it's less than10 so I can put down the 16 I can think16 I can keep that in my head 2 times 4is 8 3 times 4 is 12 I got to pre carrythat one so it's going to be a 9 and ato add you go with that hopefully prettygood anyway see here you go with thatbefore you start getting upset andsaying you despise this method orwhatever like that give it a fair gobecause this is trying to reprogram yourmind and so you are you will actually beable to do this mentally ok but don'texpect it's going to come to you in 3seconds flat ok this does take a littlebit of practice sometimes this does takea little bit practice these sorts ofthings anyway with a bit of practiceyour mental math will get faster goodluck on that anyway thanks seeyou
