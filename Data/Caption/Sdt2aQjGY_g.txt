the setup is a normal deck of cards nowhe's a cross-section of a normal takingcars and in case you don't play aroundwith cards very much let me tell youwhat's in the deck of cards for startersyou've got all of these different valuesof cards that most people up somewhatfamiliar with then you can see it startsfrom an ace which depending on the gameyou're playing is either worth of one ormore than a kingokay ace two three four all the way upto ten and then you get these on thesepicture cards Jack queen king in thatorderokay now as you can see if you replacethe ace with a1 you've got ten numbersand then three I think they're alsocalled court cards sometimes because ofJack Queen King so 10 plus 3 you've got13 cards and then you've got 4 copies ofthose because you can name them rightwhat are our suits over here they'refour of them diamonds hot clubs andspades so what you get is the same 13cards in diamonds the same 13 it coststhe same in clubs spades so if you'vegot 13 different kinds of cards and fourcopies of all of them then in totalyou've got good so 4 times now you willnotice that does not include a jokerokay for starters no games that Iactually know what I mean I'm sure theyaren't they exist because Joker's existno games that I know of actually rely ona joker and secondly whenever they say astandard deck of cards they only meanthese ones okay so therefore your samplespace is always going to be 52 fromsample space alright I hope I storedlong enough now have a look at the firstquestion this is part a it says what'sthe probability of not drawing out a sixof clubs are you looking the same withme yeahthis is exercise 8h question nine part aso how am I going to write this wellusing this sum this complement notationI'm going to say the probability of sixof clubs but I actually want it to benot a six of clubs right so I'm going toput my my complement sign over the topokay does that make senseso there's my probability the six ofclubsyes stay with me stay with me so thefirst thing I'm gonna do yeah if youlisten you'll find out the first thingwe're gonna do is I'm going to notice Icould work out how many cards are notthe six of clubs but a much better wayis to do this common theme right so I'mgoing to use this line or rather thisline okay and I'm gonna say theprobability of not getting a six is sixof clubs is one takeaway thatprobability okay so that's fairly easyto work out if you say what's theprobiem is six of clubs here are allyour clubs in heinous 13 of them rightwhich i haven't we haven't snuck off andonly one of them is a six okay this is asix of spades this is a six of heartsthis is six of diamonds so none of themare the ones I'm interested in there'sonly one in the entire deck make senseso therefore if there's only one in thewhole deck what's the probabilityII forgot to mention color actuallyyou'll notice if you can squint hardenough consider the small the diamondsin abouts are out red suits closetspades are black suits so they don't askwhat about the problem of getting a redsix which would be well there are twored six is not there there's only onesix of clubsthis is 51 52 yeah fancy yeah that'squestion I don't have an automatic okayI'll skip over B because these the samecan you look at C for me you look at Cread C now I'll tell you a little bit ofa secret see the way I've set up thisquestion on the board over there on theright hand side okay when we're markingthis thing that number at the end the 51or 52 the pot that's usually the mostimportant length of the odds-on okaywhen you're doing questions like this inprobability that 51 or 52 is actuallythe least important part of the entirequestion because someone can guess ifyou want to people too or you can get 51or 52 the wrong way this is the partthat demonstrates understanding okay soall the effort should really be I meanit's just like when we were doingquestions on like finance and I can belook tell me what's going on writesomething please don't just give menumbers now keep that in mind as youlook at Part C it says what's theprobability of not getting an ace ofdiamonds are at King of Diamonds what'sthe probability of not getting an ace ofdiamonds or king of diamonds so this isPart Cso please pay attention to the way thatI write this okay the probability ofgetting not an ace of diamonds or Kingof Diamonds yes they doI checked that it does imply it's a it'snot always clear but they do mean thesame to me okayyou're 11 are you ready this is where Ibeginlook at how I've set things up on theboard already I've got a complimentthere so the first thing I'm gonna do isget rid of that compliment using thisthing okay so I'm gonna say that's onetakeaway there probably of it actuallyhappening rather than not happening sothat make sense so this is theprobability of Ace of Diamonds walkingyou guys okay now please note I putwords in there I put commas only putslashes that kind of thing because thattells me what to do in the next itemtells me what to write when I combineprobabilities like ace and King do I addthese or do I multiply them I'm going toadd right because this this or thisthey're separate events right sotherefore I'm gonna write one takeawaynow I'm gonna put a big pair of bracketshere because these two things aretogether I'm subtracting both of themokay the probability of that ace plusthe probability of the King with mewatch the brackets as well an easy wayto get this wrong is to say oh I had toadd right there's a minus sign there andthen I'll put a plus sign but if youdon't have the brackets it changes yourpants off completelyit changes for something fun that 17:16a second okay now I'm done these arejust two specific cards and only one ofeach just like with this one over hereright so what is the probability of thisand this added together- 150 - its probability so it has to bea fraction I can simplify that of course- or 50 - is 26 so if you take away the26 that leaves behind 25 26 does thatmake sense now just as a quick notesuppose up here right I had forgotten toinclude the brightness rightwhat would happen what would change if Ihadn't included these brackets the nextline would look like this one take awayhe's the probability of getting the aceof diamonds and then he is the problemthat you've gained the King of Diamondsthat's not right is it cuz look what'shappening these guys are just gonnacancer with each other and there's somehow you got that it's guaranteed you'llnot get the ace of diamonds or the kingof ducks I'm just clearly not true okayso we're all done for matsing your wayout of that that's why things like theway you set it up and write the bracketssuper super point okay
