well welcome in this video we're gonnabe concluding this unit dealing withprobability I know it's a bummer but youknow all good things must come to an endat some point or maybe you're on theother side where maybe you've struggledwith this unit with probability becauseI know first time through it can be kindof a challenge because there's a lot tokeep track well regardless in this videowe're gonna be looking at what we callwhere we're gonna be looking at twodifferent laws where only one of them isgoing to be a valid law to be referringto but we'll talk about that here in aminutefirst though we're going to be lookingat this definition of expected countbasically all that is saying is that ifan outcome in an experiment has aprobability of P whatever that might bethen in n trials of that particularexperiment the expected count theexpected times that we'd expect aparticular L come would be n times P sofor example I have four children let'ssay if you have a one in two chance ofgetting a boy or a girl the expectedcount of having boys for example wouldbe 4 times 1/2 which would be 2 so you'dexpect that if you were to have fourchildren the expected count of havingboys or girls rather either one you'dexpect to have two boys and two girlswell I end up having four girls so thatjust illustrates the fact that theexpected count does not always tell youwhat happens it just gives you anexpectation of what we can look for nowlet's look at another situationinvolving expected count here we have atown that has about 25,000 adults in itspopulation if the unemployment rate inthis particular town is 5 percent andwe're gonna sample 200 adults from thattown and look to see all those 200 howmany actually are unemployed we canfigure out what the expected count ofunemployment would be by taking thatfive percent of unemployment times that200 and when we do that we get anexpectation of 10 now again that's anexpected count and that 25,000 adultsthat does not affect our answer at allthat's just extraneous information therewe're not going to be using thatinformation that has no effect on theoutcome andlooking at that sample of 200 adults sothat's how we would find the expectedcount now let's read out of this nextparagraph to learn more about expectedcount so it says if an event containsmany outcomes and the expected count ofan event is the sum of the expectedcounts of the outcomes to make moresense of that let's look at this it sayssuppose that the wet season in a regionis 125 days long and there is an85-percent probability of rain on eachof those days while the dry season isthose is the other 240 days of the yearand there's a 10% chance of rain on eachof those days so the expected number ofdays of rain in a year not the acceptedthe expected number of days in a yearthat it would rain the way that wefigure that out is we would take what85% of those 125 days we would expect itto rain and we would expect it to rain10% of the day of the 240 days and thatwould give me 130 point two-five nowlet's say that it actually during oneparticular year that it rained 144 daysin that region well the differencebetween the two would be well 144 takeaway what we expected to have happen theone thirty point two five gives usthirteen point seven five and thepercent difference would be to take thatthirteen point seven five out of 365days total gives us about three pointeight percent so again the expectedcount does that tell us what will happenin any particular case it tells us whatwe'll expect to happen in the long runnow this is a an important interestingpiece of history during World War twoJohn Carrick a South Africanmathematician was captured by the Germanarmy in Denmark and to intern at a campto pass a time he did experiments onchance processes and one such experimenthe tossed a coin ten thousand timesbecause I suppose he had the time to dothat and observed five thousand sixtyseven heads well we're gonna figure outwhat's the expected number of heads inthat situation well we expected tohappen half the time and half of 10,000would be five thousand so you wouldexpect to get five thousand heads if wewere to flip the coin ten thousand timeswell it actually happened five thousandsixty seven times so the differencewould be sixty seven now to figure outthe relative frequency of heads we wouldtake what actually happened the fivethousand sixty seven and divide that bythe number of trials the ten thousandand we get 0.5 whoops zero six seven orfifty point six seven percent so whatwas the difference between the relativefrequency and the probability of headswell if I take 0.5 0 six seven andsubtract 0.5 I get a difference of 0.00.0 0.2 we could even say 0.67% would bethe other way you could look at it butnotice that so notice that differencebetween five thousand and five thousand67 seems like a lot however the relativefrequency differed from the probabilityby only point zero zero six seven or0.67% so what's going on here is therelative frequency gets closer andcloser to 0.5 as a number of trialsincreases and that's what we call thelaw of large numbers nothing more thatwe do an experiment the closer thatwe're going to get to our actualprobability our expected probability nowyou might have heardlaw of averages where someone's calvinga string of bad luck and they say youknow what well do a lot of averages Ishouldn't you know next time I playedthis game I should win because I've hadsuch a string of bad luck that I'm boundto win sometimewell that law of averages really isinaccurate because the probability everytime you do something the probability isalways gonna be the same before thestring of bad luck happened theprobability is still going to be thesame after the string about every singletime you do it you have the sameprobability so there really is no suchthing as the law of averages so that isthe law that is inaccurate so whenyou're asked about the law of averagesit is not true really the law of largenumbers is true where the more that wedo a probability the closer that wewould get the closer that we approachedthat expected outcome expectedprobability but that does not mean thaton the next turn you have any more of achance that you did on the previous turnand that pretty much summarizes thislesson it's pretty simple they're justlooking at those two different livesso hopefully you understand thedifference now if there is an activityif you're using the UCS MP functionstatistics and trigonometry book thereis an activity that you could do if youwant to look in the book - just toillustrate the point of the law ofaverages versus the law of large numbersbut for the sake of time and the factthat we're gonna have different outcomesbased on because again it's just asimulation that we would do we're notgoing to take the time to do that inthis video but with that we're going toend the video so good luck now as youwork on your assignment
