We're asked which of these
lines are parallel.So they give us three equations
of three differentlines and if they're parallel,
then they have to have thesame slope.So all we have to do over here
is figure out the slopes ofeach of these lines, and
if any of them areequal, they're parallel.So let's do line A.Line A, it's 2y is equal
to 12x plus 10.We're almost in slope-intercept
form, we canjust divide both sides of
this equation by 2.We get y is equal to 6x--
right, 12 divided by2 -- 6x plus 5.So our slope in this case, we
have it in slope-interceptform, our slope in this
case is equal to 6.Let's try line B.Line B is y is equal to six.You might say this hey, this is
a bizarre character, how doI get this into slope-interceptform, where's the x?And my answer to you is
that it already is inslope-intercept form.I could just rewrite it as
y is equal to 0x plus 6.The x term is being multiplied
by 0 because theslope here is 0.y is going to be equal
to six no matter howmuch you change x.Change in y is always
going to be 0, it'salways going to be 6.So here, our slope is 0, so
these two lines are definitelynot parallel, they have
different slopes.So let's try line C.Line C-- I'll do it down here.Line C, so it's y minus 2 is
equal to 6 times x plus 2.And this is actually in
point-slope form, where thepoint x is equal to negative
2, y is equal to 2.So the point negative 2, 2, is
being represented here becauseyou're subtracting the points.And the slope is 6, so we
already know that the slope isequal to 6.And sometimes people are
more comfortable withslope-intercept form, so let's
put it in slope-intercept formjust to confirm that if we put
it in this form, the slopewill still be equal to 6.So if we distribute the 6, we
get y minus 2 is equal to 6times x, 6x, plus
6 times 2 is 12.And if you add this 2 -- if you
add 2 to both sides of theequation, you get y-- because
these guys cancel out-- isequal to 6x plus 14.So you see, once again,
the slope is 6.So line A and line C have the
same the slope, so line A andline C are parallel.And they're different lines.If they had the same
y-intercept, then they wouldjust be the same line.
