rewind just a little bit okay when youthink about events in isolation justthink of the simplest example you canlet's go back to thinking about and I'mokay now that example I always go backto is just pick a number and I'ma pick anumber and die for me I have four boysif I said something like this okay P 4how do you read that in the context ofchance there's a probability of rollinga four okay so far so good now if I saidin theoretical terms like in theory whatwere the posi your answer would be yesokay now just remind me 1 out of 6 whereis the one come from what what does itmean because it's the favorable outcomesand there's only a single four on theface of the dialyes and then the six current correspondsto it yes very good at turtle events thesize of the sample space there are sixplaces you get now underneath this wayyou've written this what I want to putalongside this river I said I know whatdid you think about eventual isolation Iwant to think about that in relation toother events so for instance if I posedthe parallel question if I said what'sthe probability of not rolling a for nowdon't just yell out the answer rightaway I just want you to think about itfor a second how would I go aboutanswering this there's at least two waysokay there's a long way a veryinefficient way and there's a better wayand the long way is what are the ways ofnot rolling for what are the actual waysthank you one two three five and sixokay so the probability of rolling not afour is all of those probabilities do Imultiply them or do I add them I addthem right because really this is theprobability of one or two or three canyou wrap this with me or five or six andwhen it's all or or you're adding thesethese are separate theyhappen all at the same time can I have a1 in it all rightso unless you're on the place so becausethere or is that means I can add that'sthe probability of a 1 plus theprobability on the 2 and you get theidea okay now that I've set it out andhopefully you already worked out whatthe answer is you can see where theanswer comes from right each of these isjust like the probability from the fallif the diet is fair each one is a sixthere's five of them so that's why theanswer of course is Isis okay so this isfine and for a diet which only has sixalternatives I you actually can writethis out even though it's inefficientbut like I said there's a faster waywe're gonna do two things number oneinstead of saying not for we're gonnagive a fancy dancer this we call it asyou can see by the heading thecompliment of four which basically meansnot afford but we write it in thisparticular way you put whatever eventyou're interested in and then you put asquiggle over the top okay so the way Iread that instead of saying theprobability of relative for this is theprobability of the complement or wronguniform which is exactly the same thingas saying not for I can't do noticeright if you roll a four all you all arenot for that's all of the options rightthat's the total sample space right sowhat's the probability of rollingsomething anything within the samplespace any of those options it's going tobe six out of six isn't it right sothat's why a six a sixth plus five sixis one says guarantee you're going toget one of these rightso therefore the way I can write this ifthese add up to one then rather thanjust adding up all of these which takesforever I can just subtract from one doyou see that the probability of thecomplement of an event is the wholeprobability take away the original oneyou started with right you guys you seethe numbers that make sense right thisof course is one and take awaya sixth which gives you the five six wehad before this is much more handy whenyou know maybe there's not six outcomesmaybe there are like 600 outcomes andyou don't want to write all of them evenif it wasn't 600 it might be somethingsimple like 52 okay I don't have towrite all 51 other options I just wantto write it in a nice efficient way okayso this language here this idea if I cangeneralize it a little bit a lot aboutspace over here on the right you can goahead and you can put this underneath ifI just don't want to get in the way ofmy cards for any event and we usuallyname our events eight for them right theprobability of that event not happeningthat's the compliment right it's theopposite the probability of that nothappening is one takeaway the poetry ofit actually happening does that makesenseso this is the way an event and itscomplement the way the probabilitiesmatch up together okay now from thatsentence which is kind of like writingthis but not just for fours for anythingokay I can get through differentrelationships out of that which I'd loveyou to put underneath it you can eithersay if you rearrange this equation justthe TEB for instance I could add thisprobability of the event I could add itto both sides right if I add it to bothsides over on the left I'll get this howlikely is the event happenhow likely is the event not to happenthey'd better add up to onedo you see that because look at thedisappear from the right-hand side allalternatively in the same way that everat this if I think about the actualevent there's no probability of thathappening is one take away itscomplement okay all three of these theyall say the same thing it's just thatwe'll use different ones based onwhatever you want to do okay
