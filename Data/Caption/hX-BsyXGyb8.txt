in this example we're asked to find themean median mode and range of the givendata set so let's first find the meanremember that the mean of a data set isthe sum of the numbers in the data setdivided by however many numbers are inthe data set so to find the mean of thegiven data set we first find the sum ofthe numbers in the data set and we have15 plus 60 plus 42 plus 8 plus 33 thenwe divide by however many numbers are inthe data set 1 2 3 4 5 now simplifyingin the numerator 15 plus 60 plus 42 plus8 plus 33 is 158 and we have 158 dividedby 5 which equals 31 point 6 so the meanof the given data set is thirty onepoint six next we're asked to find themedian of the data set remember that themedian of a data set is the middlenumber when the numbers are in orderfrom least to greatest so let's writethe numbers in our data set in orderfrom least to greatest and we have 8 1533 42 and 60 now we can see that themiddle number is 33 because 33 has twonumbers on either side of it so themedian of the given data set is 33next we're asked to find the mode of thedata set remember that the mode of adata set is the number that appears mostoften in this set however notice thateach of our numbers appears exactly onceso no number appears more often than anyother this means that there's no modefinally we're asked to find the range ofthe data set remember that the range ofa data set is the difference between thelargest and smallest numbers which inthis case is 60 minus 8 or 52 so therange of the given data set is 52
