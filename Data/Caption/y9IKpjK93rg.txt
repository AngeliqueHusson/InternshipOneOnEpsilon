 working with fractions in we're gonna do
in this case is just youa little division involving fractions
and the main thingyou need to remember when dividing
fractionsis that we turned division intomultiplication so typically the ideaswe have one fraction say a/b divided
by another fractionc/d what we do is we leave that the
first alonethat one we're dividing by we we
actually flipped end overso the "d" goes on top, the "c" goes on the
bottomand that's it you're the good thing
about multiplication and aswhen you multiply fractions you just
multiply whatever's on topso "a" times "d" and then you just multiply
whatever's on the bottom"b" times "c" so remember if you are adding or
subtracting fractions you have to havecommon denominators butmultiplications actually a little bit
easier because you just multiply acrossthe top and across the bottom inif you can reduce you simplify you do
but I amadded net that's that's it so a case on
the first one we have six divided by twoover seventhe first thing I always do if I have
anymember that's not you know not it's not
written as a fraction we can alwayswriteany number as a fraction by just dividing
it by one6 divided by one is the same thing as
sixokay so we were dividing by to over
sevenand now all I'm gonna do you just apply
my little rule here and I'm flip thesecond fractionand make this six over one times7 over two you and we cando this we can multiply either cancel
first butmaybe we just multiply six times seven
is 42divided by two and forty-two divided
by two is21 notice the other thing we could have done is we could have 
 canceled we could have saidyou know so there's a 6 on top and two on the
bottomwell 2 goes into 2 one time when timesand two will go into  six 3 times so we simplify
we will get  three times sevenwhich would be twenty-one and then on the
bottom we have one times one so you canget 21 over one war21 so typically I tried to cancel things
out before and multiply I foundin my own experience and it makes things
a little quick and a little easier butas long as you simplify at the end it doesn't  really
matter okay so what's your other exampleherewe have -7/4 divided by 4/7 same ideawe just leave the first fraction 11 so
negative 7 number 4and then i turn my division into
multiplicationin my second fraction I just flip it
over so now the 7 goes on topand the four goes on the bottom and again now I just
 multiply the numbers on top so I have -7timespositive 7 that will give me a negative 49and then 4 times 4 is 16and in this case nothing will cancel out or
 reduced so this from yourfinal answer okay so nothing too badagain the main thing with dividing
fractions you have to rememberdivision to do that we turn it into
multiplicationand again when multiplying you just do the 
cross the top across the bottomand you know if you can I would say make
use of any canceling that's out there
