g'day and welcome to tech math Channelwhat we're gonna be having a look at inthis video is how to working out thearea of circles okay so this is theamount of space I guess enclosed by acircle and so the way that we do this isas follows I'll drop the circle and Ithink first off I'll just go through afield in terms of we'll be using when weare looking at the area of circles firstoff we're going to be looking at thisthing called the radius the radius isthe distance from the middle the edgewhich is the same no matter where youare okayso this is called the radius radius andthe other way we might measure a circleis the same in terms of this entiredistance across which is called thediameter now the diameter as youprobably can see here is twice that ofthe radius now the way that you work outthe area of a circle is as follows thearea of a circle equals PI squared if piis a special constant that's used toworking out circles are generally it'sequal to about 3.1415 but the easiestway are the most accurate way for youguys to use it is to actually get anycalculator I will be multiplying thereby the radius squared by the radiustimes itself so whatever this is timesitself and then two times pi so put thecalculator off the computer as you'llsee I've actually it's got a output fromstandard mode in this scientific modeand we got down here pie okay it's noton a lot of calculators it'll be writtenlike this but on this particular onethat's written as piedid we do that we actually end up with areally big long than that okay3.14159265 bla bla bla bla bla bla blait's big a rational string of numbers sowe're going to use this to actually workout the area of a circle that's prettyeasy stuff so these are the types ofquestions you'll get when you get askedto work at the era of a circle so I'mgoing to leave that particular formulathere cuz we're gonna be using that alot but say we have a circle here and wewanted to work it out and the radiushere we want to look at the area theradius we know to be rid of that theradius is 5 centimeters so the area iswhat we want to know the area obviouslythe space within here I mean we lurkhere in centimeters squared guys werethe radius in centimeters arrogance isgoing to come out in centimeter squaredso first off what we do is we're justgonna sub in this formula so this equals2 pi times radius square which is 5centimeters times 5 centimeters and nowwe're just gonna hit this into ourcalculator okayso first off let's go PI times 5 times 5and we get the answer of seventy eightpoint five four rounded up seventy eightpoint five four centimeters squaredthat's how easy it is to work out thearea of a circle but it's really reallycritical that you remember thisparticular formula here okay so whatabout we go another one of these andwhat about you give it a go for workingit out to say you have I'll give you aone with a diameter this time rememberdiameter is twice that of the radiustwice the size of the radius so I'lldraw a circle and the one I want you towork here has a diameter it's all theway across of what about 18 meters okayso what we're gonna do is gonna look atthe area there the area equals PI Rsquared so this equals pi so you knowwhat the certainly pauses and then I'llcome back and answer it he pause itanyway I'm answering their table is theradius no the radius is half the diamondso times 9 times 9 and these are both inmeters so an answer is gonna be inmeters squared okay I can even fix it upright now just so 9 meters times 9 me sothe area to this equals as follows let'sget the calculator up clear that so pitimes 9 times 9 equals 254 0.47 what wasthat two hundred and fifty four pointfour seven I hope that but it doubleshake that 254 point for 72 itokay and that's in meters squared that'show easy just to work at the area of acircle now the other type of thing youmight get asked this of course is youmight get asked where it's actually asegment of the circle to say you weregiven a circle right as far as I'mknocking a half circle that's whatyou're expecting say you actually wereasked or within the area of this quartercircle and what you knew is only onething which is this distance here whichis six centimeters so on another area ofthis this is a part this is a quartercircle okay that might not be a verygood pitcher of one put it to quartercircle so the area equals PI squared butbecause it's a quarter of a circle whichwants to draw it would look like thisthere's a circle that's a quarter of itwe're gonna actually divide our answerby fourokay so let's do thisso this equals pi times the radius whichis six centimetersso I'm 6-0 minutes for the squareddivided by 4 and we're just gonna go inthe order and his rent so let's just geta calculator outwe're gonna go pi times six times sixtimes but OOP clear start that againpi times 6 times 6 divided by fourequals twenty eight point two seven okayso this equals twenty eight point twoseven centimeters squared now I justwant to put this calculator up just toshow you something really really arequickly with this and this is this soyou decide okay I'm not going to use piinstead PI's around about as you see3.14159 and instead what you're gonnause is 3.14 because this is the type ofproblems forgiver this I'll show you thedifference that you get if you use PI orif you actually use this particularnumber here it won't seem like much sopi three people instead of power using3.14 times six times six equals dividedby four equals twenty eight point twosix yeah you know say that's notactually much of a difference and it'snot in the scheme of things it'spossibly not a huge difference so thisis a we use 3.14 we get 28 point two sixjust double check that that's what wegot centimeters squared now that's only1/100 of I that's one hundredth of acentimeter square it's not a huge amountjust be wary with certain applicationswe really really want to have this exactin fact I think it's really really goodpolicy that you shouldn't get this is ananswer I know it's very pedantic youshould be using pi the PI button likeI know some calculators don't have pi soyeah I know you're sort of stuck thereokay but try to get one that has PIanyway that's how you go working at thearea of circles and possibly are quartercircles okay see you next one
