in this video we're going to learn howto find the volume of a cylinder andmore specifically where the volume of acylinder formula comes fromwe'll start by going back down to thebase of the cylinder which happens to bea circle and in previous years you'velearned that the area of a circle is PIR squared but where does the PI Rsquared actually come from so let's takea look if we strip away the formula andbegin just with one R we can see on ourcircle that's the radius if we multiplyby a second R R times R actuallyproduces a square covering an area of Rtimes R so whatever the radius is timesitself and we can also show this as Rsquared like we can see on the screennow also note that this is one R squaredwhich does not cover the entire circleso let's add another R squared whichgives us a total of two times R squaredwe can see that that covers about alittle more than half the circle sothat's not going to do so let's add athird R squared to the mix and we cansee we're covering 3/4 of the circle andjust a little bit more but we can stillsee that some of our circle 1/4 of thecircle is not covered so let's toss on1/4 R squared we've now covered theentire circle but you'll notice that wenow have a large square that is coveringthe circle plus an additional space inthe corners so for R squared actually isan area that is too big to be called thearea of a circle we actually have thearea of a square here so it's a littlebit bigger than what we need so let'sbreak this down a little bit by takingthat 4 R squared and visualizing thecorners that we need to eliminate thosecorners have an area of 0.8 6 R squaredand if I subtract those two values for Rsquared minus 0.8 6 R squared we end upwith 3.14 times R squared which isultimately PI R squared later in anothervideo we'll talk about where that point8 6 times R squaredcomes from but for now we're going to goback to the base of our cylinder whichis a circle we know how to find the areaof a circle and ultimately the area of acircle essentially represents the volumeof a cylinder with a height of just over0 if it is 0 then obviously the volumeis going to be 0 anything times 0 is 0but picture this as our height increasesto one unit we can see the volume of acylinder simply the area of a circle PIR squared times 1 I can increase theheight and I now have PI R squared times2 PI R squared times 3 and finally wecan sub in any height we'd like bysimply using a variable of H so ourvolume of a cylinder formula is actuallythe area of the base which is PI Rsquared for our area of a circle andthen we simply multiply it by how tallthe cylinder is so we end up with avolume of PI R squared times H for thevolume of our cylinder
