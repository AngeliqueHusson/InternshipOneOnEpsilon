all right let's not go make this anymore complicated than has to all rightthe vertex of an angle all that is isgoing to be the endpoint of your tworays kind of where your two rays aregoing to come together to form yourangle so let's look at an angle lookslike this that's kind of one in standardform and that's look like one like thatall right little bit darker so rememberthe angle angle is two rays right anarray member excuse me they haveendpoints so your endpoint going to gofrom here to infinity and here toinfinity the same point from there nowremember when just talking about theangle is the measurement between yourtwo rays so what happened what reallyhappens is between your two sides a lotof times we call it our initial and ourterminal side we're rotating about apointwell that point that we rotate about iswhat we call our vertex so that's allthe vertex is in an angle it's whereyour two endpoints are or your oneendpoint is for both of your rays sothere you go that's just a quick littledescription of a vertex in for an anglethanks
