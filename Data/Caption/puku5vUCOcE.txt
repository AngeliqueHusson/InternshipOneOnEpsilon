g'day welcome to the tech math Channelwhat we're going to be having a look atin this video is ratios this is just abasic introduction into ratios and insome later videos we will be looking athow to play around with these and workout some more complex things with themso first off what is a ratio and ratiois a way of comparing two or more setsof quantities I'll give you an examplethat if that sounds a little bit funnyso say I was looking at the amount ofcordial in a drink okayso I've bought myself some cordial I'madding it to a drink and it could saysomething like I'm adding for everythree parts cordial one two three threeparts cordial I have seven parts waterone two three four five six seven okayso this would be said to have a ratio ofthree parts to seven 3 is to seven okaythis is how we write these alrightso we're comparing one quantity toanother quantity so they're prettysimple and you can do this for all sortsof quantities okay whether it be thingsto do with weight or just even sheeramount of things and we'll go through afew examples with this so just a coupleof things with ratios the first one isthis I guess the first thing I'd want totell you is that units are importantwith ratios I'll give you an example sayI wanted to compare 3 centimeters to ameasurement of 20 centimeters you'llnotice that these are both incentimeters since fairly simple we couldsay that these had a ratio you guessedit as 3 is it's 20 okay we don'tactually write the unit's we just writeit has a ratio of 3 is 20 but I'll makethis a little bit harder near say forexample I changes this towell I changed it to two meters now howwould you write a ratio of these twoamounts because you'll notice that wehave different units so we're going tochange one of these units I'm not goingto change the cinemas you're gonna leaveat the same three centimeters loving thechanges so that the two meters is alsoin centimeters is a hundred centimetersin a meter so this is 200 centimetersnow we can easily write a ratio wherethis is a ratio of three is to 200 okaynow we're going along fairly well withthis so hopefully you're not finding ittoo hard because it is fairly simple buta few people do be I panic when they getthese so the other thing with ratios isratios can also be written as fractionsso say we were looking at something likeokay what about seconds and minutes sayI was looking at 17 seconds and I wantedto compare this to one minute now firstoff what you'll notice is to write thisas a ratio I need to change this okay soI'm going to change this all in a second17 seconds and 60 seconds here okayso we'd have a ratio of 17 is 260 we canalso write this as 17 over 60 we canwrite this in a fractional form okay andthat's all that means is but ratios canalso be written in a fractional form theother thing with ratios is they can bemade into more simple forms okay this issomething we're going to have a look atmore extensively in another video soI'll give you an example the sales weretalking about the amount of kids walkingto school we could say 20% of kids in aclass didn't walk to school they got tolift off their parents and 80 percentwalk to school so we could write this asa ratio as 20to a knee okay and that's that's why I'mgonna raise sure the air of 20 to 80 butyou can actually simplify this furtheryou're going to notice that 10 goes intothese numbers so I could divide 10 intoboth of these all right and if I do thatdivided by 10 I would get 2 is to 8 youmight look at that and go hey wait asecond - also goes into this number 2goes into both of these numbers once and4 times 2 goes into 2 once and into 8 4times so we can simplify a ratio make itmore simple and you'll notice that youknow this is always four times as muchas this you know this numbers 80s fourtimes as much as this number and eightsfour times as much as two and ones fourtimes as much as there's four there okayso this is just a simplified version ofa ratio okay so hopefully that helps youa little bit ratiosit's the next videos coming up we willactually be looking at just how tosimplify ratios and that sort of deal Ican see you next time bye
