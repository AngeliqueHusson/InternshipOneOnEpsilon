welcome let me talk very about a verybasic feature in graphing functionsoften we are students and given a sketchof a graph y equals f of X can you thenfrom that sketch draw a graph ofsomething like y equals f of X minus 3or y equals f of X plus 5 or modifyingthe upwards like was f of X plus 5 thatover all plus 4 we tried it ofteninstill upon those kids of thesecorresponds to translations lefttranslation to translations the lefttranslations to the right up and downand so forth I can never get us straightin my mind where the X minus 3 say thisfirst example corresponds totranslations to the left or to the rightthe Edler and f of X plus 5 I don't eventhink of those terms so what like to doin this video is address another way ofdealing with graphing functions like fof X minus 3 or f of X plus PI withoutthinking terms of left or righttranslations he goes to really get thisgoing I need an actual example of agraph of a function y equals f of X solet me just make something up right nowsuppose that a graph that did somethinglike comes swooping down at some greatbig arc and then one unit over it levelsoff so at 0 it dips down to a vertex ofthe like parabolic type thing and oneunit over it levels off let's make thisy equals f of X and suppose I were thenfrom that asked to graph y equals f of Xminus 3 well I asked myself what are wedoing here we're actually modifying theinputs the inputs are no longer just Xthere now X minus 3 now I original graphdoes something very interesting at 0 sothen ask what input is now behaving likezero for the x's well obviously i put inx equals 3 I'm getting f of 3 months 3 fof 0 so I could say that 3 is the new 0for this graph which means whatever thegraph was doing at 0 is now doing itinstead at 3all right then there I know the graphmust be coming in swooping down have avertex at 3 and then 1 unit overleveling off must be occurring at 4that's it there's the graph I guess thatdoes correspond to a translation to theright but I don't even think of thoseterms Isaid what number is the new zero for theX's in this case three years which meansdoing the second problem y equals f of Xplus five I'll do this one in green if Iwas to sketch that well I need to askmyself was okay what's the new zero forthe x'swell negative five was obviously the newzero for the X's so where the graph wasdoing at zero before it's now doing itat negative five there's gonna swoopdown and Bend up and one even over go tothe right that must be at negative fourthat's it there's the graph of y equalsf of X plus five in this third examplelet me get a different color this boardis gonna be a mess and it's alreadymessy I'm actually doing two things hereI've taken the graph y equals f of Xplus 2/5 and to each the outputs I'madding four units as I take all the withall the outputs I had before and makethem for higher you know with kids I'dgo through some process here but it'spretty straight for that means I whatthe graph had before in green but noweverything has shifted four units higherso this zero now is for us higher thisleveling office for high everything'shappening for its higher I must have agraph like that so there it is there'sthe graph of y equals f of X plus fiveplus four I mean thought about left orright translations I guess I did tothink about vertical translation therehowever if you wanted to this is anoption I actually I even leave it likethis personally but you can tie thistogether and rewrite this equation as Yminus four equals f of X plus five now Ican ask myself okay I am I modifying theX in X inputs yes I am then modifiedthis way what's the new zero for the X'sI guess negative five is clear the newzero for the X's and we won't find theupwards wise yes I amwhat's the new zero for the Wiser's foris the new zero for the wisest sowhatever is happening at height zerobefore for the Weiser's is now happeningat height four greatso here it is here's the new zeros forthe exercise whatever is happening atheight zero before for the Weiser's isnow happening at height 4 here it isthere's my graph all happening at high 4instead with negative five being my newzero for the x's so some people doprefer actually to think of what's thenew zero for the Weiser's what's the newsuitdoesn't do it that way I tend to staywhat's the new zero for the exes andthen think about adding four to theoutputs there's just a matter of stylethere all right that's it of coursethere are more complicated functions yequals F of 2x minus 3 plus 7 and soforth and put a 9 on front here's alittle bit more analysis but then we getinto scaling that's worth another videoso basic transformations of graphs by ascaling and dilation and so forth itgets a little next one I'll do all rightthanks so much
