okay in this video I'm gonna talk aboutwhat are called arithmetic sequences andrecall a sequence is just a listing ofnumbers a regular just a plain oldsequence doesn't have to have anypattern at all to the numbers thatappear but an arithmetic sequence isgoing to be a sequence where succedingterms in the sequence differ by aconstant amount so in this video I justwant to give a real quick introductionto what arithmetic sequences are andanother video I'll talk about findingthe general term a sub N and then alsoabout finding sums of partial arithmeticseries so the only thing we're gonna dohere determine which of the followingsequences are arithmetic if they arearithmetic we're gonna give the value ofD so we'll talk about this D here so theidea of an arithmetic series is simplenotice okay so to go from 3 to 8 wewould have to add 5 to go from 8 to 13we would have to add 5 to go from thenumber 13 to 18hey we add 5 and notice this patterncontinues we'll just keep adding 5adding 5 adding 5 and you know assumedlyif this pattern continues well then itwould certainly be what we call anarithmetic sequence because every termis is differing by a constant amount andthis value that you have to add to getto the next term is gonna be positive 5so we say our D value is positive 5notice in my second example here I startat negative 0.7 then we go to negativeone point seven negative two point sevennegative three point seven negative fourpoint seven etc in this case every termis differing you have to subtract one toget to the next term so in this case wewould say yes this is arithmetic and ourD value equals negative one and ourthird example okay well let's just testone of my numbers here so so one pointsix to two- point - it looks like we've added on0.62 point - 22.8 we've added on pointsix oh two point eight two three pointthree though we've added on positive 0.5and once you find two numbers that aredifferent it doesn't matter what happensfrom then on out since they're notdiffering by the same amount we say it'snot arithmetic okayso you know the only real thing here tocheck of a sequence is arithmetic isjust to be careful with your arithmeticand in my last one here four thirds fivethirds to seven thirds eight thirdsthree well notice we could change - ifwe make that into a fraction we couldmake it two over one multiply top andbottom by three hey we would get sixthirds likewise we can make three intonine thirds and we go from one-third 5/36/3 seven thirds eight thirds 9/3 so itlooks like we're adding the value of 1/3each time to get to the term after thatone so again we would say this one isarithmetic and our D value would equalpositive 1/3 so the first one yes it'sarithmetic the second one is arithmeticthe third one we said wasn't and thefourth one we also said was arithmeticso that's the basic idea of anarithmetic sequence that's all there isto it so finding again a formula for thegeneral term and using that cansometimes be a little trickyalso sometimes - they'll have you add upfinitely many terms and we'll in someother videos I'll talk about doing bothof those things
