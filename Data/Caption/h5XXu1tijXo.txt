radical expressions ready class yeahgame ah yeah all right never gets oldokay so first you probably know how tosimplify the square root of 9 rememberto speak up question or thought I wantto hear it and I'm gonna do the same sowhat's the square root of 9 3 but what'sa radical radical is the square root agood question these little things areradical that's an 80s expression forcool or they're just square roots youknow you can call them group or whateverokay so what is square root of 19 wellwhat does it mean the base know what isneat work oh it's if there's 3 times 3is 9 but ever no okay one number timesitself equals not ah what number timesitself equals 9 3 ok 3 what number timesitself equals 100 yes 10 ok mr. doobguess so it's kind of like its oppositeof like squared I don't know yes andit's like okay it's the opposite ofswing that's what I call it square rootkind of get to the root of the matterlet me comesquare root so x squared is 100 okaywhat number times itself equals 8now we're getting into it is there anumber a whole number time - no no so wehave to do something elsewhat is it approximately approximatelywhat is it just so we know 3 3 is itmore than 3 or lessor 3.5 3.5 well if the square root of 9is 3wouldn't the square root of 8 P lessthan 3 it's like 2.5 yeah me want to becloser to 3 or 2.5 or closer right maybe2.8 that's my best guess to two pointeight oh two point Matt just so we knowthat's what it isall right watch the door there okay okaywhat we need to do is need to actuallysplit this into factors in which one ofthem is a perfect square I'll show youwhat I mean finefirst and foremost what is a perfectsquare yes okay what is the definitionof a perfect square just when there's anumber times itself let's make a list ofall the perfect squares here goingvertically because vertical is fun noI'm standing vertically the Skyler'shorizontal my mighty number need Georgegun okay what's 1 times 1 1 let's dothem too boy next since 9 3 times 3 4times 4 16 5 times 5 25 6 times 6 moreMORE 80 100 more 21 21 more ready formore calculate what say what sister diesokay let's see what if they're luckynumber 13okay these arethe list of perfect squares okay what weneed to do now is split the eight intofactors in which one of them is theperfect square so factors means whatmultiplies to 8 so what two numbersmultiply to 8 in which one of them is inthis list or 4 times 1 all right here 4times 2 many other teachers will do thisdifferent ways they do what's called afactoring tree this is my way so feelfree to do it another way you know so 4times 2 now that we wrote it like thisbecause 4 times 2 is equal to 8 we splitit like so any problems with thatfor a more time square to make thisclear that's the next step that's thenext step the reason we did that was forthe next stepsquare root of 4 is equal to 2 squareroot of 2 we can't simplify any more sothis is the answer so the square root of8 simplifies to 2 root 2 or 2 rad 2 or 2times the square root of 2 nice allright let's do another one we'll leavethat one up as an example okaysquare root of 26so what is the first steps a lab you'resaying it go key factor factor in whichone of the factors is a perfect squareand nine is one of those factors yet sothat's my horseexcept my leg the horse and my other legis the giddyup don't you have a horsedon't have a horse a pony oh I would letyou have a little sister and a brotherokay one of the factors is a perfectsquarenine nine so now let's go good techniquenine times all right so what's thesquare root of nine dear I'm pleased nowwe're playing all the animals partstoday okay so we're going against thanksso precious yes yes please yeah thisnever mindsquare root of nine is what we're tothree stay the square root of three andthat's it so that's it in a nutshelllet's do it bigger numbers all right nowwho can explain what we're doing withthe nine and three again in their ownwordscaptain factory in which what know whatit factoring in what manner re one ofthe factors is what a perfect square oneof the factors is a perfect square okayfor example let's do20 okay wouldn't you agree that whenyou're factoring 20 you can do 10 times2 sometimes two works but are ten or twoperfect squares no also one of them hasto be a perfect one of them has to be aperfect would be that would be 4 times 5times 5 that's right that's the idea soyou don't I'm going to put here andtimes 2 and I'm going to cross this outthis is we don't we avoid we avoid thisbecause none of them are like space noneof them are perfect more in force youget it thank you for the thank you forchecking in sometimes she gets okay thisis now if we write this as 2 square rootof 4 is 2 square root of 5 remainsthat's it okay I'm going to add to thisconstruction up not only do you want oneof the factors to be a perfect squareyou want one of the factors to be thelargest possible perfect square thelargest possible perfect square and herecomes the classic example I've hadtrouble with this one when I was yourage I got this one wrong I remember like48 all right we're going to have funwith 48 so what are some factors of 48in which one of them is a perfect square
