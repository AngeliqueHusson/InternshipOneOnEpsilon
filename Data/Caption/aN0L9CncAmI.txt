okay in this example we're going to findboth the focus and the directrix of theparabola y equals 2/5 times x squared sothe way I'm going to kind of approachthis problem is the way I think about itis we kind of want to write this thisequation in a certain form and I'm goingto try to write it in the form x squaredequals well 4 times P times y and you'rethinking well hey okay there's no P inthere but again all it really says to dois get the x squared by itself okay wecan do that and then whatever the thecoefficient is in front of Y we'll sortof rewrite that so that it when we take4 times the number P we get the samecoefficient and again the point is whenwe get our p value it turns out that theline y equals negative p is going to bethe directrix directrix and it says thefocus for this type of parabola it saysthe focus is going to be at the point 0comma P so again I'm just trying torewrite it in this form and thenhopefully it'll be a little bit moreuseful so ok so let's try to do thisokay so we've got y equals 2/5 times xsquared okay well again this to me saysget the x squared by itself okay so whatI'm going to do is multiply both sidesby 5 over 2 right so 2/5 times 5 over 2that would just give us 10 over 10 or 1so we're left with 1x squared and thenwe have well just 5 over 2 times y sonow we've almost got it in this form andmaybe I'll just reordered here I'm goingto write it as x squared equals 5 over 2times y obviously we don't have to dothat but I'm I'm going to just to makeit look almost exactly like this okay sothe idea again now it says whatever's infront of the Ythat's going to be our value we're goingto rewrite that so that it says fourtimes some number equals five over twowell okay it says so we need to solvefor P so it says four times some numberis going to equal well five over twoall right to solve for P we can justmultiply both sides by one over fourokay so on the left side a fourth timesfour will just leave us with P fivetimes one is fivetwo times four is eight hey we've gotour p value and now we've done all thehard work so it says the directrix forthis parabola it says our directrix willbe y equals negative 5/8 so that's ourdirectrix and then it says our focus forthis this parabola will be zero comma Por zero comma 5/8 so now we've got we'vegot our solutions so and the sotechnically we're done and you know Ialways just like to think about it againjust a little bit more if you thinkabout graphing the parabola y equals 2/5times x squared well x squared justopens upwards 2/5 is going to change howit you know is bending a little bit butin general that's kind of a rough sketchof our parabola two-fifths x squared andagain it says our directrix is is kindof behind the parabola at y equalsnegative five over eight and thatcertainly seems reasonable and it saysour focus here was at the point 0 comma5/8 which also seems reasonable you knowthis would be kind of a quick way for meintuitively just to make sure that Ididn't make maybe a sign mistake ormaybe I didn't switch the coordinatesout incorrectly just little things likethat so again though that's kind of allthere is to it so you know I think themoral of the story really is just sortof remembering to write it in this formwell and then kind of you know all thelittle associated procedures with it
