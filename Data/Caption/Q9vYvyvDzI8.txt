an architect is building a verticalmonument the base of the monument is arectangular prism there is a prayer maidat the top so this looks a little bitlike the Washington Monument themeasurements are shown below what is thevolume of the monument so we have thisrectangular prism and then we have thispyramid on top and so the volume of arectangular prism is prettystraightforward it's just the widthtimes or you could view it as the lengthtimes the width times the height so justthe prism and let me color this prism inblue so this is just the base right overhere let's figure out the volume of justthe base so I'll call it the volume ofthe well let's call it B volume of thebase is going to be equal to the lengthtimes the width times the height so thatis 16 times 20 times 85 and well I couldwrite the unit's down just so we seeit's going to be cubic feet 16 feettimes 20 feet times 85 feet 85 feet isequal to something feet cubed or cubicfeet and I can work this out 16 times 20is going to be 320 and then I want tomultiply that times 85 multiply thattimes 85 5 times 0 is 0 5 times 2 is 105 times 3 is 15 plus 1 is 16 now I haveto worry about the 8 right over herekeep a zero here because it's really 80so 8 times 0 is 0 8 times 2 is 16 8times 3 is 24 plus 1 is 25 25 and thenwe add them all up 0 plus 0 is 0 0 plus0 0 6 plus 6 is 12 and then 2 plus 5 is7 and then you get bring down the 2 so27 thousand two hundred twenty seventhousand two hundred cubic feet that'sjust the base that's just the base overhere now we have to figure out thevolume of this pyramid and I'm not goingto prove it here and actually I'll maybeprove it in another video and you need alittle bit more sophisticated math to beable to prove it but it's actuallypretty neat what the formula forvolume of a pyramid is because it's kindof what you would guess based on if youknow the Vaught the the area of a circlethe volume the volume of a pyramid isthe length times the width times theheight of the pyramid divided by threeand the reason why I say that's prettycool is because if you're looking forthe area of a triangle the area of atriangle it is the base times the heightand you could view the width or thelength as the base of the one of thedimensions of the base it's the basetimes the height divided by two this isyou could view area as kind of a volumein two dimensions and volume is volumein three dimensions two dimensions threedimensions so it seems like that worksout III don'tI can't even visualize a pyramid in fourdimensions but I'm curious what would bethat high per volume what would be theformula for the hyper volume for pyramidin four dimensions that's something thatyou can think about after this problembut with this out of the way now that weknow the formula and we haven't provenit to ourselves but it has a certainelegance to it so we'll just run with itfor now so the volume of the pyramid andthis pyramid in particular we know whatthe length and the width are it's thesame as the length and the width of theactual base it's going to be 16 16 feettimes 20 feet and then we're going tomultiply it times the height of thepyramid now you have to be careful herethe height of the pyramid is not thelength of one of these edges right overhere the height of the pyramid is if youwere to go into the middle let's sayimagine this pyramid is transparent andif you're in the if you're in the middleof the top of the base right here andyou went straight to the middle of thetop of the pyramid that is that is theheight and they gave us that height at22 feet so this is from the top of thebase if we were to go straight up notalong this edge if we were to gostraight up to the same height to thesame height as the top of the pyramidthat is 22 feet so the height over hereis is 22 feet so that gives us it'sgoing to be 320 times 22 so let me writethat down this is going to be equal to320 times 22 times 22 just multiply itout so first I'll do is that towe'll do it in blue so 2 times 0 is 0 2times 2 is 4 2 times 3 is 6now I'll worry about this too well thisis really 20 so we have to put a 0 here2 times 0 is 0 2 times 2 is 4 2 times 3is 6 and we add them all up 0 4 you geta 10bring out the 1 and 7000 so thenumerator right over here the numeratorthe length times the width times theheight is 7040 but reaction I have todivide it by 3 if we just left it thisthis would be the volume of a cube ofthose dimensions but we care about apyramid so we actually have to divide itby 3 so it's going to be that quantitydivided by 3 and its feet times feettimes feet so it's cubic feet so it'sgoing to be that divided by 3 cubic feetthat's going to be the volume of thepyramid volume of the pyramid and let'sactually figure out what this is so if Itake 3 in 2 and I could use a calculatorbut that wouldn't be as much fun 3 into7040 3 goes into 7,000 2 times 2 times 3is 6 subtract 7 minus 6 is 1 bring downthe 0 3 goes into 10 three times 3 times3 is 9 subtract you get 1 bring down the4 3 goes into 14 4 times 4 times 3 is 12subtract subtract bring down the 0 3goes into 20 6 times 6 times 3 is 18 yousubtract you have remained or 2 we couldkeep going and have a decimal or we canjust write that the volume of the prismis 2346and 2 with a remainder so 2 and 2/3 and2/3 feet and 2/3 if we kept dividing wewould get point 6 6 6 6 6 and we wouldjust keep on repeating forever so that'sthe volume of the prism we already knowthe volume of the base the volume of thebase is let me align things the volumeof the base is 27,000 27,000200 feet cubed these are both in cubicfeet and then we can add them togetherso you're definitely gonna have the 2/3there you're gonna have to the 2/3 6plus 0 is 6 4 plus 0 is 4 3 plus 2 is 5comma and both of them 2 plus 7 is 9 andthen you just have this 2 over here sothe volume of this entire WashingtonMonument like looking thing is 29,500and 46 and 2/3 cubic feet and we're done
