okay just let me go through this realquick so we have the fourth term equals125 the tenth term equals 125 over 64and they want us to determine the 14thterm all right so obviously later onwe're trying to find an term right we'renot talking about sums so therefore weknow that the formula we're going tohave to use is a sub N equals a so 1times R to the n minus 1 right now all Iwant to go through ladies and gentlemenis when we're looking at something likethis remember when we talked aboutgeometric sequences if I said a sub 1times a 2 2 times a 3 times a sub 4remember we said a so 2 minus s 1 has toequal a so 3 minus H 2 2 right those addto equal each other write that and thatequals our difference however what if weweren't given a 2 2 and a so 1 what ifwe were given a so 3 and a sub 1 we knewthough that we can still find thedifference between those two valuesright we could take the difference ofthose two and kind of like divide it by2 and that would still give us ourdifference and we also knew that a so 3minus a sub 1 is still going to be thesame same as a so 3 minus a sub 2 rightis its because they're both 2 unitsapart they're not going to give us ourdistant or difference but they're stillgoing to be equal to each other nowlet's look at geometric ratios we knowthat geometric ratio is 2 to erase 1 hasto equal a so 3 of raise to 2 which hasto equal a so 3 of creates a 4 a Sephoraquits of 3 however if we know we have acommon ratio with the ratio then of a so3 over a sub 1 still be equal with a so300 or a so 4 over a so - it won't beour R but would it still be our ratiowould still be equal Rachel yes soladies and gentlemen what I can do thenis I can still apply the terms that weregiven to be able to figure out what ourRS because that's what we need to do isfigure out the R so to do that let'shave rather than we don't have a sub 1all right so let's just go and take thisis our 10th term so let's do a sub 10equals a sub four times R to the 10-4all right so what I'm doing is I'm notstarting at 1 & 1 now what I'm doing isI'm just finding the ratios between thetwo terms okay that were actually isgoing to help us now find R okay doesthat kind of make sense because we'renot starting at one it's a sub 1 and 1right we're not going between 1 & 1we're going between a sub 4 & 4 okay sonow we know at a sub 10 is 125 over 64equals a sub 4 which is 125 times R tothe sixth power now by solving for R byplugging these two values and solvingfor R I can find out what the exactratio is so it's like me given I havetwo values but just dividing these twovalues is not going to give me my ratiobut if I plug them into the formula Ican now find out what that are what thatratio is all right so now / 125 remembertaking a fraction divided by anothernumber you can multiply by thereciprocal that will multiply that outto one multiply the top by thereciprocal that now divides out to oneso you're left with 1 over 64 equals Rto the 6th power so remember just likewhen we had x squared equals 4 you tookthe square root of both sides now wehave R to the 6th power equals 1 over 64so we take the sixth root of both sidesand then you say what is the sixth rootof 1 over 64 well remember we can breakthis up into sixth root of 1 over the6th root of 64and you could say the sixth root of onewhat number multiplied by itself sixtimes gives you one that's obviously onewhat number multiplied by itself sixtimes gives you 64 and you want to firststart and see does easy basic numberswork first and then try to say thenactually try to calculate in yourcalculator but we notice 2 times 2 times2 times 2 times 2 equals 64 you couldguess I'll tell you guys what to do howto do that in your calculator but yeahyou can plug in your calculator or youcan just understand what numbermultiplied by itself six times so youcan see that R is equal to 1/2 yeah it'sa six come on that's a beautiful sixit's beautiful so now we know our 1/2equals our R and we want to be able toterm in the fourteenth term all right sonow ladies and gentlemen if we have asub N equals a sub 1 times R to the nminus 1 now if I want to figure out what14 is I know what a sub 1 is not soactually I need to go ahead and figureout what a sub 1 is going to be firstyes so now we at least figured out whatR is right and that's good so now sorryso ok so we have a sub N equals a sub 1times R to the N minus 1 right now whatwe need to do is be able to figure outwhat our a sub 1 is yesokay so we have a sub n equals a sub 1to the 1/2 times n minus 1 no we'retrying to find out our rule yeahwhich problem is to work with huhlet's keep the constantwelllooking at this I'm having a issue withit right because how am I going toreally be able to find out my rule howto be able to solve for ace of 1 becauseor 8 how am I going to be able to solvefor my ace at 1 which is this and Istill don't even know what my value ofedit so it's not going to work like myarithmetic sequence what is 10ok but what I can do though well listenwe can do this the same thing thoughyou're right I'm sure what I was tryingto do is like arithmetic you can go backto your original points and figure itout but we can't do that in this caseright we can't figure out what it ishowever I could do this if I say a sub nequals a sub 1 or the other right nowwhat if I started I need to figure outwhat the 14th term is I know what the10th term is I don't know what the firstterm is but I know what the 10th term isand I know what my R is which is 1/2right I'm sorry let's do let's just doour and I know I could do 14 minus 10 isthat something I could plug in that willtell me what 8 to the 14th is because Iknow what 10 is and I know what 14 minus10 and I know a sub 10 I know R and Ican do 14 minus 10 so therefore I couldsay a sub 14 equals a sub 10 which wesaid was 125 over 64 times 1/2 raised tothe fourth power and 1/2 raised to the4th power so 4 raised to the 4th poweris going to be 1 over 16 so we have a tothe 14th equals 125 over 64 times 1 over16so I just do 64 times 16 and 1024 so asub 14 equals 125 over 1024 so what Iwanted to show you is we don't alwayshave to go back to use this formula tofind a sub one you don't have to go backand find the formula to go to one if youknow your value of 10 right and you wantto find 14 you can plug in 10 and 14 youjust need to make sure though Kellyyou're not doing 10 minus 4 or 10 minus1 if you're finding a sub 10 and a sofor you got to do 10 minus 4 rightokay you just use with yes and but it'sa little different because what I toldyou guys in geometric a lot of times
