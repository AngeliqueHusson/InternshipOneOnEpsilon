g'day and welcome to the tech mathChannel what we're going to be having alook at in this video is a way ofworking out cube roots and these arefair numbers whose cube root value liesbetween one and a hundred it's a reallyreally good little trick ahthat's one you can really amaze yourfriends on it does require a tiny littlebit of work but it's once you'veactually got a couple little things downpat it's a really good little trick forare working at cube roots almostinstantly okay so first off flaco a lotof well the videos I'm going to ask youa little question how fast can you findthe cube root of this number here twenty1952 okay I'll give you five secondsokay times uphow did you go with that ah now if yougot the answer of twenty eightcongratulations you did really reallygood you got the right answer reallygood hiif not don't worry keep watching thisvideo because what I'm going to show youright now is how to work out the cuberoot of say this number here or anynumber whose cube root value liesbetween 1 and 100 okay so here we gothat's before we go though I think it'sjust before we do that I'm going to showyou something that's a really uh that'ssomething that that's probably the bitwhere the work goes ok so I'll move thatacross and sees something I prepared alittle bit earlier and what this is isit's a table that shows you all thecubes of numbers from 1 through to 9 so1 cubed is 1 2 cubed is 8 3 cubed is 27so on and so forthand we're going to use this idea to workout cube roots ok so like I said thereis a tiny bit of work but it's not toobad ok so just bear with us first offwhat I want to do looking at this is Ijust want to draw your attention to acouple of things I want to draw yourattention first off to this one herethis particular one here the 3 cubed is27 this one here the 7 cubed and the acubed now I'm just going to write thosenumbers down and you might be able tosee something with these ones are whatabout all our make these a good blackcolor so we have two and you're going toseeas an aide over here tosser eight downthere so we have this pair 2 & 8 both ofthose add up to 10 so they sort of gotogether pretty well we also have thispair 3 & 7 and what you to notice isthis if it's 1 cubed the answer is 1 + &4 cubed the answer is 4 and the answerends in a 4 & 5 cube the answers end ina 5 and the 6 cube the answers end in a6 and 9 cube the answers in a 9 but forthe to the 8 the 3 and the 7 somethingslightly different happens for the twoand ends in an 8 and for an 8 and endsin a 2 and for the three and ends in a 7& 4 7 and ends in the 3 you see thatokay so probably the major thing youhave to remember so far under these guysand these particular ones here theseparticular pairs 2 & 8 & 3 & 7now with that in mind we can work outour cube roots and I'll show you howthat's done now I'm going to work it outby you know quietly and see we can workout what I do here okay this is how youwork it out to the thinner bit ofthinking music and there we go there'sour answerdid you see how I did that okay I'llshow you it's not too bad at allnow the way this works is this so firstoff what we do when we're working theseout is we will have a look at the lastdigit okay so this digit here the twonow if it's a two we put down your mighthave guessed it we put down the oppositepair though the pair that goes alongwith that the eight if it was an eightwe'd put down to two if it was a sevenwe put down a three if it was a fourwould put down a four okay so hopefullyyou've got that and then we cross outthese three digits here and we're leftwith this 21 here now what we do is welook for a number who is either 21 orless which occurs over here so 21 orless on the answers here is this 80 okayand that's 2 2 cubed so our answer is 28did you get that you might you might notof I reckon I'm going to go through afew more of theseokay so I'll rub these out and I'll giveyou a couple of other examples here I'llrub that number right out and oh Ididn't want that to happen I'll put himback I'll keep those up there let'slet's just leave those I want to giveyou a different example so what aboutsay what's the cube root of 157 thousandfour hundred and sixty-four okay so whatdid I doit's a four and A four is not a twothree seven or eight so what I do is Iwrite down my four okayChrist how those three last digits andthen our 157 recur about here so thenext number under is 125 which is thisfive cubed so our answer is 54 yeahhopefully yeah yeah no you get yourunderstanding that one hey let's doanother example I'll tell you what withthis example I'll give you a littlemoment to try and work it out okay I'llgive you a nice easy one what about ourtwenty-nine thousand seven hundred andninety one okay so do you remember whatto do here it's okay so it's a 1 okaycross out those three digits 29 the next127 which you over here is a three allright sir 31 yeah pretty good all rightI'm not going to let you go that easyah what about I'll give you this oneeight hundred and fifty seven thousandthree hundred and seventy five okay lookat that last digit it's not that eighttwo three or seven it's a five so we'regoing to put down that five and eighthundred and fifty seven the next numberunder that is this 729 which is a ninecubed95 their answer okay what about one lastexample what about this particular onewe will put down 570 1787 okay how areyou going with this one you mightrealize this is one of those specialones this is one of the the only withthe 71 here so we're not putting down a7 this time we're putting down a threeokay last three digits out of the waythe next number under 571 over here is512 our answer is 83 so that's how youdo these and you can do them prettyquick but as I did say to you there is alittle bit of work with this because asyou might have realized with this andyou're going to go aaaa a few people Ican always guarantee I'll get the oddlittle comment where people say hey manI can't wait that off the top my headthis one you do have to go through andlearn the cubes for the numbers 1through 2 9 here look a few of these afew of them you probably if you're okayat Matt's you probably be fairlyfamiliar with and it's not that huge adeal you pick these up pretty quick Ireckon you be able to learn them in afew minutes okay it's a matter ofsitting down and remembering them andonce you can actually do that you startto be able to do this mentally which isreally good because I tell you youreally throw you you may tell you thoughyou can basically say you're working youknow work out a anomic in the cube of anumber any number between 1 and 100 andI'll tell you what the cube root is Itry it out ok they'll be amazed when youcome out that number automaticallythey're gonna think you're genius lookit's not genius it's just a little trickok anyway I hope you really liked thatoneI'll see you next time
