to do is we want to find a line that'sperpendicular meaning at a right angleto the segment and cuts it in halfbisects it okay so what we're gonna dois we're going to take our compass okayso this is just a basic compass herewhat you want to make sure is that thesetwo points come together you don't wantone to be like down here and therethey're going to be up there you wanthim to come together at the end and sowhat you're gonna do is you're gonnaopen it up and what you want to do isyou want to make sure that you open itup more than halfway if it's less thanhalfway you're gonna have an issue youwant to make sure you open up more thanhalfway it doesn't have to be exact butwe're gonna do is we're going to make anarc below the segment and above thesegment like so okay and if you wantsome students will just make acontinuous arc like like that but youcan separate the two arcs and then whatyou're going to do is go from the otherendpoint okay like so and they're gonnamake two more arcs let me just make surewe got it correct here so we've got thisarc and then we're gonna just rotate thepaper like this we're going to makeanother arc above and below okay andthen what you're going to use you'regoing to use those two points to draw aline okay so those two points ofintersection right here and right hereand that's going to be yourperpendicular bisector okay there you goso you can see that that's the rightangle 90 degrees and you can see thatit's cutting that segment in half sothis has been how to construct aperpendicular bisector I'll see you inthe next video
