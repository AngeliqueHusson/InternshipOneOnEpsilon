So I mentioned in passing in another video
that if you throw a dart at the real numberline your chance of hitting a rational number
is exactly zero.And there's no tricks here, the dart is guaranteed
to land on the line, and there are an infinitenumber of rational numbers on the number line,
just waiting to be hit.Rational numbers flooding into every crevice
between two other rational numbers, everypossible ratio of one integer to another,
so many numbers, but yeah, the dart won'thit any of those.0%.Really, actually, 0.Think about them written out with all their
digits.There¡¯s some nice simple numbers with a
finite number of non-zero digits before it'sinfinite zeroes.Then there¡¯s rational numbers with repeating
digits.Every rational number has a section that repeats
infinitely, sometimes it's just a repeatingzero, sometimes a single digit, and sometimes
many digits.The repeating sections may get longer and
farther as you get more and more between,but if it can be represented by a fraction,
it can be represented with a repeating decimal.And you can make up any set of repeating digits,
and it will be a rational number: the repeatingsection over an equal amount of 9s. .1repeating
is 1/9, .11repeating is the same thing, 11/99or 111/999, it's all 1/9th, and of course
2 times .1repeating is .2repeating or 2/9,.3repeating is 3/9 or 1/3.12345678901234567890 repeating is 1234567890/9999999999..9repeating is 9/9.A number that repeats infinitely has only
finite information.But when you don¡¯t repeat, there¡¯s just
so many more possibilities.Any infinite sequence of numbers can make
a real number, and if it doesn¡¯t repeat,the number's irrational.You could make a random irrational number
between 3 and 4 by starting with 3 and rollinga 10-sided die an infinite number of times
for the digits.What are your chances of getting exactly pi?What if you wanted a rational number that
ended in repeating digits, like 3+1/3?How long could you expect to keep rolling
3s, on a fair die?Doesn't matter how lucky you are; if you literally
roll infinite times, the chance of all 3sis zero, exactly zero.You'll eventually roll something else, and
then even if you go back to threes for a while,you'll eventually roll something else again.Same with any rational: imagine rolling a
dice and getting the same repeating sequenceover and over every time you roll it.How long would you realistically expect that
to last?Forever and ever through infinite rolls?No chance.Of course, the chance of getting all 3s is
the same as the chance of getting any particularnumber, and if the chance of getting any particular
number is exactly zero then how can you hitany number?It calls into question the very process of
how to pick a random real number, becauseyou can't actually define a real number through
a series of random dice rolls, and math hasproblems with randomness in general, and a
single infinite random numbers would be infiniteinformation which doesn't fit in our universe...But before we get to transcendentals, let's
talk algebraic.Algebraic numbers can by definition be defined
with algebra. (which, spoiler alert, othernumbers can't.)So for example every rational number can be
defined as some finite combination of digits,a division sign, and another finite combination
of digits, and throw a minus sign into thefirst symbol's mix, but you can also use other
symbols to get irrational numbers.Some irrational numbers can be defined very
simply with just a couple algebraic symbols,like sqrt2, or just a few algebraic symbols,
like Phi the so-called golden ratio whichis exactly (1+sqrt 5)/2.Then, some numbers can only be defined as
part of an unsolved equation, here there'sno algebraic way to solve for x, you can only
approximate.But we don't care if we can solve for x as
long as we can fully define it, no approximations.Which, by the way, it's totally crazy that
you can make up algebraic equations that algebracan't solve, but also entirely inevitable,
and a hint that there's much cooler math lurkingbeyond algebra.And you can totally list the number of possible
combinations of algebraic symbols, startingwith combinations of 1 symbol and then listing
all valid combinations of 2 symbols and then3 and so on up until an arbitrarily large
but finite number of symbols.You'll have a lot of combinations that aren't
valid or that are equal to earlier ones sothey don't need to go on the list.But since you can list all possible algebraic
numbers, they match up 1 to 1 with the countingnumbers, there's exactly as many, they have
cardinality aleph null.This also matches up 1 to 1 with trying to
list all numbers in decimal by putting togetherall combinations of digits, which is something
a lot of people mentioned in response to Cantor'sDiagonal proof.Does this process get you all the numbers?Well, it gets you all possible finite combinations
of digits, but nothing with infinite digits,no irrational numbers, and not most of the
rationals either, since most rational numbersend in an infinitely repeating series.It's not a one-to-one number correspondence
unless you can make a function that tellsme exactly which unique entry on the list
corresponds to pi, and which to 1/3, and whichto champernowne's constant... and the answer
can't be "it gets to the irrationals at infinity"because first that's not a whole number and
second that's not one to one, so, yeah, probablynot a one to one number correspondence.It's so simple to list all possible combinations
of algebraic symbols, but this list will neverget to the numbers that would take an infinite
amount of symbols to define, just as listingall combinations of digits will never get
to numbers with infinite digits.These non-algebraic numbers are the trancendental
numbers, they transcend algebra.And even if there is some infinite way to
define them, this list of all combinationsstill never gets there.Maybe there's a way to approach a given transcendental
number with a pattern that makes sense, likefor pi and e, but for most numbers we have
no idea how to define them or whether theycan be defined at all.You hit a random real number with a dart and
we don't even know how to look at the result,how to differentiate it from all the ones
around it.Does the dart give results in decimal?Because no finite amount of digits will tell
you what this number is.Does the dart report back in algebraic symbols?Because there's a 0% chance that you've hit
a number that can be defined with a finiteamount of algebraic symbols.Somehow, out of the uncountably infinite set
of transcendental numbers, 100% of real numbers,most people only know Pi and e and maybe,
like, champernowne's constant, and... whatelse is transcendental?Well, maybe one reason most people don't know
more transcendental numbers is that nobodyknows very many transcendental numbers, the
field of mathematics is a little slow on figuringout how to prove whether numbers are transcendental
or not, there's lots of open questions inTranscendence Theory, like, we don't even
know whether Euler's constant is irrationalmuch less transcendental-- super embarrassing...
or maybe it's rational or maybe tomorrow someonewill come up with an algebraic equation for
it or maybe someone will prove that you can'tprove whether or not you can prove it's transcendental.I mean, that kind of thing happens.Sometimes.Anyway, I think most people's problem with
Cantor's Diagonal Proof is actually a problemwith Real Numbers, with the idea that there
are numbers that cannot be defined, that haveany arbitrary combination of infinite digits,
infinite information, because yeah, that'spretty weird.Whoever decided to call them "real" numbers
didn't think that one through.Thanks a lot, Descartes.
