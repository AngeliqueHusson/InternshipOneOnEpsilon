so for this one first of all Layton Johnwe don't like even though we use thisvery often when we're calculating a lotof things we're probably not reallygoing to want to be dealing with toomuch too much of dealing with minutesand seconds we're going to want toconvert this over the decimal form soremember we're talking about decimalformwe have degrees plus 19 minutes over 60minutes yes right it's 19 over 60minutes actually I just have one of themplus 20 seconds over 3600 seconds rightbecause it takes 60 minutes to make onedegree and it takes 3600 seconds to makeone degree so now I need to find thedecimal version of this so what I'mgoing to do is I'm just going to take 19divided by 60 and I'm gonna add that to20 divided by 3600 and that gives me 75point 3 to 2 and I can't remember itsaid around or I just say convert toradians so we'll just leave like thatbut we know that this just repeats onright those just keep on repeatingcorrect okay well now I need to convertthis over to degree format remember thisisn't a degree right so let's just roundthis to 7.2 I need to convert this todegrees so how do we convert a degreeI'm sorry we need convert this Radianhow do you convert a degree to a Radianwe need to multiply by rememberwhy would it be pi over 180 and not 180over pi there's one special thing thatwe know that I like to use personally toremember which one is correct why do youwant to multiply by one PI over 180 then180 over PI which is correct but why doyou want to do it they might no want toraise their hand yes yeah because thedegrees symbols are knocking about cuzright if you're writing radians you'renot writing something in degrees rightright radians is just a whole number orin terms of pi so when I have a degreesymbol down below my degrees does it saylike they cancel out so now all theysimply need you to find my radiant formis I just do seventy five point three totwo times pi divided by 180 and myanswer in radians is one point three 1radians I camera how much that said theround but it's just gonna be one pointthree one radians okay got that one
