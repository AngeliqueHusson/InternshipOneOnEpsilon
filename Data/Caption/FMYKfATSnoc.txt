hi this is fresh talker in this videoI'm going to explain why I could guessthe card you were staring at we startout with the set of five cards you startout at the number one and that reallydoesn't matter you could actually startat any card in the trick when you gothrough these moves it actually doesn'tmatter which way you move which day ofthe month it is the move which reallymatters is the second and last move thaton an odd card you need to move threetimes and on an even card you need tomove four times the reason is that ifyou're on an odd card you're going toend up on an even card and if you're onan even card you stay on an even card soif you're on an odd card one you can endup at the cards two or four if you're atthree you'll end up at two or four andif you're at five you'll end up at twoor four similarly on an even card youwill either end up from two you'll endup at two or four or from four you'llend up at two or four and the reason isan odd number plus an odd number is aneven number and similarly an even numberplus an even number is an even number soafter this step I can be completelycertain that you are either at the cardstwo or four the final move is just tomove left two times and if you're on thenumber two you're going to move to oneand then back to two and if you're atfour you get to two so with certainty Ican say you're at the cart too andthat's how the trick worksI hope you enjoyed this video pleasesubscribe to my channel you can catch meon my vlog mind your decisions onTwitter at pressure Locker or again myebooks at Amazon
