today and welcome to Tech math Channelwe're going to be having a look at inthis videos we will be looking at how toadd and subtract certsso this looks this this takes intoaccount a few of the our ideas of I'velooked at in previous videos looking inthirds and first off I'll go through acouple of these first off what 1/3actually was now certain is a numberwhich is exactly expressed as saysomething under a square root sign okayso the square root of 2 now we wouldhave type this into calculator you getthis number with a big long string ofdecimal places after that are neveroccurring so the most accurate way ofsite expressing this answer under thisnumber is as the square root of 2 theother things we looked at this othervideos was how to multiply since wherewe found this particular law or rulewhich was a square root of a times thesquare root of b is equal to the squareroot of a times b now an example this issay a square root of 2 times the squareroot of 3 is equal to the square root of2 times 3 which is the square root of 6another really really important propertyto understand is that that we had a lookat what thirds can be simplified byexpressing the number under the rootside as a product of factors so one ofthese factors you're looking for is aperfect square so one of the factors ofthe numbers under here is a perfectsquare it means you can simplify it alittle bit further so say you had thesquare root of 12 or you can actuallyone of the factors before you canactually simplify that a little bitfurther okay if you can't you can'tactually simplify it further so we'regoing to be having a look attoday we'll in this video so let's havea look at a couple of examples to startus off with this our perfect squares bythe way we might be looking saysomething like 2 squared which is 4 or 3squared which is 9 or 4 squared which is16 5 squared 25 and so on and so forthso I'm not even keep those up for whenwe're working through these becausethat's a really great idea again that'sone of the big ideas to get us how youcan actually simplify them further wedid look at that but I think it's it'ssomething which eludes people a littlebit so without much further talking I'mjust going to launch into how to add andsubtract suits now say you get saysomething like 4 times square root of 2and we want to add this to 5 times thesquare root of 2 now we can do this andthe reason for this is as follows thisis a go here to 4 times the square rootof 2 and this one over here is equal to5 times the square root 2 okayso altogether we have square root of 2we actually have altogether this manyPlus this many so we actual togetherhave 9 times the square root of 2 andjust what is 9 square root 2 so this isthe answer to this so you can directlyadd thirds together like this as long asyou have these like terms in it asassert okay just a square root 3 youcouldn't add these guys but as long asis it a like terms you can add themokay now let's take this a little bitfurther so say for example we wish to dosomething like the following we wish tosay do something like three times thesquare root of three and I want to addthis to two times the square root of sixas add this to the square root of threenow look if you can say something likethis to answer what you might noticestraight away is that we have a lightterm here to here okay so we can addthese guys together we get this answerof 3 square root 3 plus square root 3 is4 square root 3 this number here I can'tbe simplified any further because it hasno are factors that are perfect squaresactually none of these do so can't besimplified any further and it is anunlock term so we just have to actuallywrite this as 2 square root 6 and that'show we know when we finish thesequestions we should be able to look ateach of the actual numbers under thesquare root sign and go well they've gotno factors that are actually perfectsquares here okay so it's a reallyimportant thing to get so this here isthat answer okay so what about we addsomething a little bit harderso say I get you to add we'll add ittogether the square root of 8 plus thesquare root of 18 now this can besimplified a bit further because if wehave a look at the square root of 8 thefactors of a we have a couple that areactually perfect squares we actuallyhave one that's a perfect square whichis 4 okay so this one here is equal tothe square root of 4 times 2 okay whichis we can break up further because thisthis law of when we multiply them intothe square root of 4 and the square rootof 2 okaywe're adding this to the square root of19 so this here can also be broken upinto the square root and if you have alook at here because we have 9 9 times 2which can again be broken up into thesquare root of 9 times the square rootof 2 and these are being added togetherokay so we can go through and answer acouple of these because the square rootof 4 is 2 and the square root of 9 is 3and this has been multiplied by thesquare root of 2 so I can just write thesquare root of 2 next week and this isbeing multiplied by the square root of 2we're adding these guys together so weend up with is 3 square root 2 plus 2square root 2 sorry and 3 plus 3 squareroot 2 is 5 square root 3 again this hasno factors obviously that there's nofactors apart from 1 so we can't takethis any further this is our answer sohopefully you're understanding that abit hopefully this is really beginningto get how you can actually even see ananswer when you've got one of these okbecause it is a real art form I thinkdoing since I've got very confused Iremember it's for doing news because Ididn't even quite understand that so I'mgonna go through one last example whatabout I do is square root of 54 plus thesquare root of 45plus the square root of 125 now withthese look for factors that are perfectsquares and they some say we cansimplify them this fall go into themthere's nine and you're looking forpossibly the biggest ones if you can so9 goes into 54 it goes in 9 goes in thesquare root of 9 and we have the squareroot of 6ok the six nines are 54 over here we arethe ones we're going to be adding thefeminine put the pluses of differentsides we can really separate things uphere so over here we have 45 and 45 andothers and go into it here 9 5 is a 45so we have the square root of 9 timesthe square root of 5we're adding this to finally we have alook here the number to go in here thatlargest one I can think off units 25 is23 the square root of 25 and 25 times 5so in the square root of 5 125 ok you'regood with that so we can answer a coupleof these the square root of 9 is 3 thesquare root of 9 here is 3 and thesquare root of 25 is 5 and then we justwrite these square roots next one sosquare root of 6 and square root of 5the square root of 5 X if I multiplyeach fromand put the same signs between so do wehave any life term C we do so we can addthese guys together we end up we threesimply equals three times the squareroot of five plus five the square rootof five so put this one down here firstactually because it's a bolt in thatorder this is going to be three timesthe square-root sixties or one sake copyfactorize anymore none of these numbershe younger none of these perfect squareI was going to it so he can't join youany further down and these guys herethey're they're factors can't go anyfurther now because neither could maybethey don't have any factors that areprolific squeezing him so we just haveto add these guys together say 3 plus 5is 8 square root 5 and that's our answerso hopefully that really helped you areadding the adding square root numbersand subtracting look I know I didn'tactually do it examples here butsubtracting a similar sort of thing justwhere you would actually be takingnumbers away obviously but really reallyimportant I think that I understand howto multiply thirds but also and thatthat that's in order to add them butalso that this idea how you canfactorize them using this idea ofperfect square numbers perfect squarefactors okay I hope that was a big helpgood luck in doing surds in math classsee you next time
