the beauty about not theory is it's sortof a special subfield of mathematicsMarie don't have to know muchmathematics you don't need to know a lotabout numbers you don't need to knowabout differential stuff no integrationno matrices it's a branch of mathematicscan pick up from scratch all by itselfand actually come up with interestingresults and understand what's going onpeople then often ask what about Nazisor something practical I cannot think ofsomething that's really practical in theterms of your shoelaces or so when theystill believed that our universe isfilled with some ether ether was thatmedium that would transport you knowlight waves and so on and then I thinkit was Lord Kelvin and others thatbelieved that the atoms are justdifferent knots so the simplest possibleatoms say hydrogen maybe just the unknotand then maybe helium is next morecomplicated knot and so that's the tryfor a lot and then you go down theperiodic system and and of course it wasa beautiful and tempting way of bringingorder into the periodic table except itwas just plain wrong I mean pretty soonpeople found out that is no ether and ofcourse also people found that actuallyAtmos break apart into into particles insome way there's more structure to itand they're clearly not not they're moremore like little planetary system and sothat was the end of that on the otherhand not actually now play a role inadvanced physics in advanced chemistryand in advanced biology you're onphysics you know even with string theoryand and similar things there instatistical mechanics that suddenly theyuse some of the things they could proofis knots that seem to apply there inchemistry they're now building moleculesthat are deliberately knotted incomplicated ways they're also peopleworking with nanoparticles that seem tofind materials that have interestingproperties when you're the elementaryelements at the small scale are not itand finally in biology you probably havemillions of knots in your body it turnsout many bacteria but even in your cellsome of the DNA strands are actuallyclosed loops and some of them areactually happened to be knotted if youhave so very close DNA strand that maybenot that and you can see in this casethere may be a particular group exposedand it can undergo some chemicalinteraction with other molecules butthen if this thing kind of folds up in adifferent waythat part may no longer be available butsomething else may pop out and then thatcan interact so as part of theregulation of what goes on inside a cellsome of these strands may recoil andchange their shape and turns out thateven can change they're not goodnessbecause there actually are some enzymesand these enzymes say can we essentiallycome along and snip strand andessentially let another strand passthrough and then reconnect it somethingcourse mathematicians would never dobecause that that's totally against whatyou're allowed to do in knot theory sothat's their nots play a role in veryadvanced fields and flee challenges foryou here typical kind of exercises youwant to do and you get started with knottheory is you look at something that youmight draw arbitrarily you know havingover-and-under crossings in some way andthen the question is what knot is thisand now you may want to go and take yourpipe cleaners or wires and try tocarefully lay out this particular knotwith over and under crossings carefullyobserve fuse the ends together and nowthe question is okay which knot is itI'm just counting here it's going to beone two three four crossings so youthink oh it must be the for crossing notmust be the figure eight knottrue or not truelet's take this loop that's of hangsdown and just kind of flip it up rightso now somehow this thing goes up theremakes a loop and comes back down andthen goes into this knot this loop upthere can be untwisted and it goes awaybut then we're just left is this partwith this closing back onto itself haveyou know what that is that's a trefoilso here you see an example where youhave something that looks likely morecomplicated it's relatively easy tounravel this and figure out okay this isjust a trefoil knot well things can getworsewhat knot is this now yeah you can do alot of mental exercise I think I couldtake this whole loop and kind of flip itover and then I can actually pull itthrough here and similarly I can takethis loop here and flip it around theback to the other side I'm pretty surethat this knot will get simpler when youtry to unravel it I think you shouldreally lay this out try it with somewire or pipe clean and figure out whatnot it is I imagine people don't likehomeworkall right go on no more difficulthomework here is yet another knot onetwo three four five six six crossings noproblem I mean I can try to mentallyflip these loops around or so andnothing comes of it so I'm probablystuck now I go back to the nut tablethat we had before can we figure outthis six crossing knot which one ofthose three it is and you may want to doa lot of deforming and probably will getvery frustrated because you may not beable to find anything and he said way tomake them is there a fourth differentkind of knot not reallymathematicians call this a composite nutit's really too trifling not stucktogether you can see from here to thereit's clearly a trefoil knot and we cantake this loop and kind of flip it downand then we'd have another triple knotand it's coupled to this one with thesetwo links so anytime you can take onecomplicated knot and cut it opensomewhere so two strands stick outanother complicated knot cut it opensome or two strands stick out you put ittogether you essentially get a compoundknot and that's not I don't know it'sthat's likedoesn't fit into a table of well itwould make things much much morecomplicated so this allows to simplifythings now all of the nuts that you seein here are called prime nuts theycannot possibly be reduced to somethingsimpler they really on their own ascomplicated as they get but there aremany many complicated nuts that can betaken apart like a complicated numbercan be taken apart into prime factorsbut once you have a prime factor you canno further simplify it so all the nottable does is give you only prime nutsthat are not themselves compound but nowyou can take 7 3 and take you know 6 3snip it open here snake it open therestick them together and you makesomething that has on the order of 7plus 6 crossings but it's not a 13crossing not it's it's this compound notlet us see graphically you've dropped abomb on me so if you didn't do that youknow then the not table would becometotally unwieldy okay now it wouldexplode you even more quickly and evenfaster you're actually are on the otherside and then you have to go oncethrough more through the roller-coasteruntil you come back to where you startedso it's just one long string you knowessentially tied together
