yes good question this is not a questionthat we have addressed directly at themoment because this is a question thatcomes on to like fractions decimals andpercentages are but even though wehaven't been doing fractions decimals orpercentages in particular these thingsdo come up in the topics that we'relooking at think about this think aboutpercentages that's an easy example whichtopics that we've been doing to top ityou know interest interests are allpercentages percentage rate right 4%baba you've got to convert that to adecimal okay in the same way even thoughfractions is not the explicit topicwe've seen a whole bunch of fractionsbut take a coordinate geometry okay sothis raises a question example supposeyou were um you are finding an answerfor something okay and when you punchedit into your calculator it all superfind out and this is what you got okaynow the question is should I leave thatas an improper fraction with thenumerator bigger than the denominator orshould I convert it okay so the firstthing to say is you should just read thequestions read the question if thequestion says give your answer as animproper fraction there leave it and ifthe question says provide your answer asa mixed numeral then convert it and thecalculator will still do that for youlike you know how to press the button todo that right shift and infraction okaybut there's a second thing sometimes thequestion would tell you but if you'reclever and thoughtful about it you'llknow which one's more helpful you lookat the context okay you think what isthis number for what is it meant to dookay um what am I going to use it forokay so for example suppose these aresome coordinates okay suppose thiswasn't like say the x value and the yvalue was like what okay so that's apoint in space okay and then suppose foranother part of the question you getanother you know suppose that was amidpoint okay and then you get someother pointyes this is I followed this examplebefore and you'll see why in a secondokay now suppose these are what you'vegotI can't plot this I can't see what theselook like and the reason why is becausewhen you have improper fractions they'rereally hard to compare right which oneis bigger I don't know I don't know myyou know I know how to compare hearts ofbirds and quarters they're easy I dealwith them all the time but it is its25th they're hard now what do you thinkyou think the top one who else yeah yougreat ok now it turns out you're rightok it is the top one you can have itthink about how the ratios work butuh-huhmixed numerals make this super easy okif you go to calculator and you convertboth of these to mix numerals it'sactually very very simple because youlook at the top one I like this upbefore it turns out to be 4 and 118 okyou check out because 4 times 18 thatwill give you 72 so it works okwhereas this fraction down the bottom is3 and 8 2015 this this is a 4 insomething and this is a 3 in somethingokay now the question maybe wasaccording to ahmud question and you haveto plot these graphs ok I'll put thesepoints rather the question didn't tellyou you should do one or the otherok but when you look at the context andthe fact that you need to compare theseand compare them accurately and knowwhere to place them so now on your axisright where would you put these thingsokay well you got 0 here y axis x axisright if I plot some compass I take onetwo three four five and one okay wherewould this be for and a little bit it'llbe somewhere like bathokay it's cold this one a and calledthis one B so there's a and B is gonnabe well if that's for this would bethink it'll be somewhere around herethat's me so you can see yeah that'sright that's right another 32 it's quiteright whereas this is quite close tofour isn't it yeah okay but the wholepoint is that like we are sort of goingaway from this where we just kind ofhand it to you and say we want it thisway we want it that way it's now sort ofbecoming a little more real-world whereyou can decide yourself but one way isbetter than anotherlike if you're thoughtful about whatyou're going to do with it
