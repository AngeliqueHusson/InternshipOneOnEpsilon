I can absolutely see how you do it doesit hurt does your head it as afirst-year undergraduate as a secondyear undergraduate as a third-yearundergraduate and as a professor ofphysics it does my head in so it's yeahit's it's a very tricky concept so onesymbol that's very important to me isthe symbol J and it represents a part ofa complex number and it has a veryspecial significance because to allphysicists and engineers J squaredequals minus 1 and that sounds alreadyto be an extraordinary kind of objectit's something that has only beenappreciated for a few hundred years inmathematics the idea that we can findthe square root of a negative number andwe call it naturally an imaginary numberwell yeah I can explain the theconundrum of a square root of a negativenumber if I take 0 and square it I get 0if I take 1 and square it I get 1 and ifI do the same with the negative numbersnow minus 1 squared unfortunately isplus 1 and minus 2 squared unfortunatelyis plus 4 so you can't get at thenegative side of the axis with a squareuntil you use Jyou know I call if I understandcorrectlywhat Sheamus calls je I would call thatI in that is a square root of -1 from AJwould be something like a currentdensity so the difficulty here is thatwe've got the sort of same letters thathave been used in multiple senses andactually that does make it quitedifficult for example from undergraduatestudents to get get the heads aroundsome of these concepts when we keepchopping and changing a long time ago itwas depicted by the Greek symbol iotaand I think that people have alwaysassociated iota with either somethingvery small or something very veryabstract indeed and over the yearsbecause I is used for so many otherthings Jay has become the preferredsymbol we are certainly set in our waysand that you won't get many physiciststo sort of go over to the dark side ofthe engineers and start using J forexample but that's a question of theculture you've built you you grow up inI guess things become moreinterdisciplinary we might start to seea little bit more cohesion in terms ofthe usage of symbols J is all aboutrotation it's about things that go roundand round or that oscillate up and downin some kind of sinusoidal or smooth wayand J has particular significance inwhat we call the the complex plane canyou get your head around I know you useit but can you get your head around theidea of an imaginary number in truth noit's a device it's only a mathematicalconvenience it's a way to help us to usethe equations to get a predictionalthough we can mathematically representit and mathematically represented withAI for example we cannot observe it it'snot an observable quantity it's not aphysically observable quantity and theoutput in the input are both real thingsthey're both measurable instantaneousquantities like displacement and forceor voltage something we can measureinside in the middle of thismathematical process we use some numbersthat you can't measure you could nevermeasure an imaginary quantity and yetthey help us to make the rightprediction of what comes out in terms ofI is a really really important consolereally important number for forphysicists does thatbut do you see how that looks to peoplelike you understand a bit can youimagine how that looks people like me Ican perfectly well imagine how it looksand I distinctly remember firstencountering the concept of an imaginarynumber and there are some superb paperswritten that in fact discount the ideathat we should ever use J on the groundsthat it conceals some structure that wecould explain by another means and soyes this this the way complex numbersand these mathematical quantities arelinked into these very fundamentaltheories of physics in the physicalworld means that yes there are thingsthat although we can express themmathematically we certainly have not gotour heads completely around but inactual fact it's proven its value inengineering it's taught in allundergraduate courses probably fromengineering courses from the first yearand it simplifies all of ourcalculations in dynamics
