all right we are stuck on thisparticular polynomial division X cubedminus 3x plus 2x cubed no exquisite 3X's + 2 / x + 2 hmm looks like we'restuckwe thought about unexploded brilliantidea turns out not helpful here becauseI don't know how many dots to drawwinner and explode because I not tell mewhat X is what can we doall right this is why I love being amathematics teacher because right now wehave a wonderful opportunity to learn alife lesson so here's the life lesson Iwant to teach right now if there's somein your life you want just make ithappenand deal the consequences oh so what Imean by that I see one dot two dots isI'm really wanting here and I got thatone dot there's something in life I wantright now what do I want right here wellI want two dots to go with it so my lifeadvice there's something life you wantjust make it happenthere it is two dots but deal with theconsequences now I can't just changethis box it was meant to be empty sotechnically I'm going to keep this boxempty so how could I keep that box emptyand still do what I get what I want wellwhat if I did this whoa I put in someanti dots with these two dots that boxwith annihilations is still technicallyempty so I haven't changed anything andI've got something I've got what I wantto I say in fact all right so that's atleast one group of was looking for bingonow like all green ideas that was bluethat was clever that was grand but thereal question is was it helpful it gotus going a little bit but I'm not quitesure but we need got us all the waythere hmmall right so what can we do now I seethose two dots there let me know likethat one right now serving a nail I wantrip to go with them you bet there iswhat I want in life right now is a dotright there to go with those two dotsthere make another one two pairbrilliant now something life you wantmake it happen but deal with theconsequences what will be all thatconsequences actually put another antidot to counteract it run it so now I seetwo of what I want one there and onethereI'm still quite a bit helpful got me alittle bit furtherfeels good but not for sure if it'sreally doing what I wantbecause now I've got all these anti dotsfloating around oh heavensall right so murmurs like these mightjust say we really are stuck or might betime to go for a little walking is thatyour mind rest and think about this fora while and then maybe a flash ofinsight has come to you because actuallyhaha I see somethingwell they did this one anti dot andthose two energy dots one is e dot -anti dots is that the exact opposite ofwhat I'm looking for that's an anti oneof what I'm looking for in fact there itis againwhoa one add you dots - NT dots makesanother anti one and that accounts foreverything now that feels really goodbut I see the artists it has to be 1xsquared - anti X's and one seniors I wasactually lying about lying earlier onthis method is point it really does workso what I'll do now is yet anotherexample to show how this works just topractice it it is actually grant theskills tour for this is excitingI just love it so let me clean the boardwe'll do one more exampleall right board is clean let's doanother example let's do say X to thefifth minus one divided by X minus onelet's try okay the numerator okay lotsof boxes so there is a one box an Xbox xsquared X cubed x to the fourth X to thefifth one exorcist yep no extra force noexcludes no X Squared's no X's and oncean t1 all right I'm looking for X minusone all set looks like well that's an Xand an anti one so I'm looking for onedot and one anti next to each other Isee none right now but I'm not going topanic because I have a life lesson itunder my belt which is something likeyou want make it happen I would love anedgy dot to go with this dot please makeit happen do all the consequences gotone of what I want okay anything else inlife on one right nowsoon that dot there a lot so an edge dotthere make it happen do all theconsequences enjoydot tag it up make it happen deal theconsequencesthat can happen deal the consequences ahand look it worked out perfectly becausethere's a final final copy of what I'mlooking forso that's this division public that nicething I got this really strange answerlooks like is what an excellence or andan X the cube and an x squared and an Xplus 1 this polynomial division worksout magically by the way I need to pointout people really do seem to forget thatX can be a number in algebra class forexample I think this problem now so thisworks out to be a nice answer tells methat 17 to the fifth power minus 1 whatabout crazy big number that is is amultiple of 16 so multiple of 16 I claimthat's divisible by 16 look you see Icould see that from there huh actuallyall this great polynomial work is reallygreat result in number theory you cantell if numbers have factored or not byplaying with some polynomial work likethis crazy all rightgrand stuff probably a polynomialdivision high school algebra here isjust beautiful just draw a picture andit all just falls out magically love ityou
