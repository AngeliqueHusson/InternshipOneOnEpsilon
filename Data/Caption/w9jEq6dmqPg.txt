Identify all the rays shown in the image below.and this is a reminder what a ray is.A ray start at some point and then goes on forever in some direction.In order to find a ray you need that point that you're starting off onso let's that point over there is called Xand then you need another point that sits on the rayand the ray is just keep going beyond, wewill name that point as "Y" and we will call the ray "XY"It starts in "X" and keeps going in the direction of "y"for ever, it crosses "y" and keeps going furtherwe need the second point to specify the directionin which the ray is going.So, lets identify all the rays shown in the imagebelow, we can start anywhere, we will start atpoint J, the only line segment we have starting from Jis JH going up, goes upto H and keeps on goingin that direction beyond H, ray JH, starting from Jgoing through H and going beyond it forevernow if we go to H, there is no ray HJ as the line endsin J and does not keep going beyond J, there is noray H as it is just one point, just usiing one point,we cannot say it as a ray. now looking at our diagramthe only ray is JH. Now let us look at the other points.If we look at point C, once again there is no pointafter C to specify it as a ray, we can have a ray CE,starts at C goes through E and goes on for ever,you can also have a ray starting at C, going through Fand going on forever, CE & CF are the same raysas F sits on ray CE and E sits of ray CF,so CE & CF are the same rays,now lets think about what we can do from point E,We can start at point E , go in the direction of Cand go beyond C, so it is a ray, ray ECyou could start in E and go in the direction of A and gobeyond A, so EA is a ray, and we can start at E andgo in the direction of F and go beyond F, that is ray EFray EF and ray CF are different as thestarting points are differentNow lets go to point F. To the left of point Fthere is no other point. We can look at the right,we can have ray FE, start at F go through E andbeyond E, you can have ray FC, start at Fgo through C and beyond C that is teh same thing as FEray FE and ray FC are the same as the point Eis on ray FC, then finally we have not focussed on point Ayou may think there is ray AE, but the line does notgo beyond E, so it is not a ray, to the top of Athere is no other point, so there is no ray there eitherthat is all the rays based on the points specified.If they had given us a point over there, we could havehad other rays,There are 6 rays in this problem
