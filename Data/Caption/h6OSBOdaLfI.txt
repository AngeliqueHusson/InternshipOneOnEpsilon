I think I already did this is my videobut I was making on one okay to do thisproblem again there's two different wayswe can do this the first way is just totransfer it to exponential form rightyou have a logarithm transfer next bunchof form e to the negative first equalsthat then you can evaluate this as xequals 1 over e so take 1 divided by eand that equals x the other way we coulddo this is I noticed that this has abase e right that s base e so I can getrid of this logarithm our whole goal insolving guys remember when you'resolving for x your whole goal is to getx equals right well when we're solvingwith logarithms our kind of goal is notreally to have a logarithm unless wehave to right because logarithm prettymuch tells us we're gonna have anapproximate answer so always try to getrid of logarithms we don't really wantto be dealing with them if you can avoidit so here I can get rid of thislogarithm if I raise if I raise e to theLn of E it's going to equal 1 right sowhat I'm doing is I'm gonna raise thiswhole equationa lot of X equals e to the negative overthat one on one property got you guyscan raise or e be raised on both thosesidesso then what happens is this now cancelsout x equals E to make it first
