hey everyone we've been getting a lot ofquestions about how to graph functionsinvolving cube roots let's go ahead anddo an example together so our focus hereis how can we graph a cube root functionover a specific domain which we'll calla restricted domain so a cube rootfunction is going to look like thiseither f of x equals or y equals thecube root of something so let's move onand do an example together here we wantto graph the function represented by yequals the cube root of x minus 2 forthe domain negative 6 to 10 so we callthis a restricted domain since we onlycare about how the function acts betweennegative 6 and positive 10 so we onlycare about one portion of the coordinateplane so if we think about this in termsof a table of values for this functionwe only want the X values from negative6 to positive 10 and since we arelooking to plot coordinate points we'rereally only concerned with the integershere now for each x value we have tofind the Y value so that we can findsome coordinate points that we can ploton the graph and then construct ourfunction so for the first x value ofnegative 6 I want to take that value andreplace that with X in the originalfunction and then evaluate so negative 6minus 2 equals negative 8 and the cuberoot of negative 8 equals negative 2 sowhen X is negative 6 Y is negative 2 andwe have the first point that is going tobe on our graph now to find the rest ofthe Y values for this table you caneither repeat this process for each xvalue or you can use the table on yourgraphing calculator by inputting thisfunction into y equals and that would bethe cube root of x minus 2 either waywill allow you to find the value of yfor each input value of X now keep inmind you're going to get a lot ofdecimals here since only certain numbersare perfect cubes so that's okaynow once you have completed the tablewe're ready to plot some points andconstruct this graph now we only want touse the points that have x and y valuesthat are integers because we don't wantto have to estimate the location of thepoints that have values that aredecimals and also we'll see why justusing these five points will be enoughto create an accurate sketch of thisfunction starting with the first pointnegative 6 negative 2 you can go aheadand plot these five points and theneventually we can draw the graphnow the mistake that students often makehere is that they connect their pointsusing straight lines this results in agraph that is incorrect boom the graphof a cube root is curved so we need toconnect these points with a curved lineso now we have constructed the graph ofthe function y equals the cube root of xminus 2 over the domain of negative 6 to10 now another thing to look out forhere is that since the domain isrestricted we do not include arrows onthe end points of the graph so againwe're only concerned with the graphbetween negative 6 and positive 10 wedon't care what it does beyond thatdomain and that is how you graph afunction involving a cube root over arestricted domain piece thank you somuch guys for checking us out pleasesubscribe to our YouTube channel formore free animated math lessons updatedevery week
