[Music]hey guys Robin here and Levi and todaywe're going to talk about polynomiallong division okay let's get startedtoday we're going to talk about a base Xmachine here is a base machine but whatbase is it we can still do math with iteven if we don't know the base we'lljust call it base X the first column isthe one column the next home is the x'scolumn and then we have the x squaredcolumn and the X cubed column if wewrite down this number we have one xsquared two x's and two ones that's apolynomial okay so far you guys haveseen base one you've seen base to base 3base fiveyou've seen it all but now we're gonnamix things up so what if you don't knowthe base say it could be any of thenumbers I mentioned before but you haveno idea what it is we're gonna let thatbase be X so base X so here's an examplewe have the first box this is a ones boxthe second box this is the x box and thethird box is the x squared box as itkeeps going on each box progressivelyadds one to the degree so this would beX cubed x to the fourth X to the fifthand so on we have the polynomial xsquared plus three X plus two and we'regonna divide that polynomial by X plus 2and so to show that we're gonna look atit down here where in the ones box aregonna put two dots to represent the plustwo and then the X Box gosh it feels soweird to say X Box this is not sponsoreddon't worry we're gonna put one and soit works just likeat this point it's just like what you'vealready learned with division just withfancier names you'd find the pattern onthe bottom in the top and you'd replaceit with a blue dot so as you see in thatbox is an X plus two and that's a singledot and then two dots you find thatpattern up here and you'd show it likethis and you replace that with a bluedot so get rid of these guys get out ofhere right there right there yeah don'tforget that and then you find these guysput one right in theresince there's one the x box and this onein one's box that the X plus 1 so xsquared plus 3x plus 2 divided by X plus2 equals x plus 1 it seems like cheatingespecially if you've already experiencedpolynomial division long divisionsynthetic division and all that it seemslike cheating but it's not it's math oklet's try it under tips okay so we haveX cubed plusthree x squared minus X minus three andthen we're going to be dividing that byX plus three every time we see X plusthree up here we're going to change itinto a 1 so here we have X plus 3 so wecan do it place it just don't and thenover here we've another negative sowe'll just replace it it's so then wehave our answer X cubed plus 3x squaredminus X minus 3 divided divided by Xplus 3 it's x squared minusall right so here we have a much biggerproblem as you can see yeah we're donewith the baby stuff alright let's getgoing so there's one new thing as youcan see there's no dots in the box righthereit's just there's no X to the 4 so whatwe have here is 2 X to the 5th plus 5 Xto the 5 X cubed like 2x if it plus 5and X cubed plus 4x squared plus 3 Xplus 4 divided by x squared plus 1[Music]here's all the patterns that we found sowe replace them with these blue guys soyeahwe have this ready oh and there's youranswer[Music]2x to the fifth plus 5x cubed plus 4xsquared plus 3x plus 4 divided by xsquared plus 1 equals 2x cubed plus 3xplus 4 yeah they're in there you have itthis is some basic polynomial division Ihope you enjoyed watching the video butdefinitely try this at homealso this is not the only thing that youcan learn about this division there's aproblem that comes up and we're going toshow you how to fix it in a future videobye guys thanksyou
