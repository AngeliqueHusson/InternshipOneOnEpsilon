alright so another example here if sortof figuring out you know we're trying tofigure out which trig function we coulduse to bestest describe a given graph soand again just assume this thing keepsrepeating so suppose we have asymptoteshere at negative PI 0 pi 2 pi and thenwe have this sort of general shape wellto me this looks a lot like the graph ofjust regular oh let's see it's eithertangent or cotangent and I believe thislooks a lot to me like just plain oldcotangent X so remember cotangent hasasymptotes at 0 at PI at 2 pi atmultiples of piso negative pietc and but remember cotangent normallykind of this place where it sort ofchanges we actually call this this wouldbe what's called known as an inflectionpoint kind of changes from sort ofbending upwards to sort of bendingdownwards it's sort of like you knowthere's there's a sort of a change indirection in the bend of the graph righthere but that normally happens at the ycoordinate of zero so again at PI overtwo we sort of have this sort of changeand the way that the graph is bendingalright so no problem there so there'sjust y equals cotangent of X and againthe only reason I'm sort of pointingthat out is to me this new graph looksvery similar to just plain old cotangentX but notice this sort of point where itsort of changes it's the way that it'sbending again this inflection point iswhat it's called notice that now happensat the y coordinate of negative two soto me it looks like this original graphit looks like the graph of cotangent Iwould just like to take that graph andmove it down two units well to move agraph up or down to shift a graphvertically all we have to do is justeither add or subtract the number thatwe either want to move it up or we cansubtract the number if we want to moveit down so in this case I want to movethe graph down two units so to me thislooks simply like the original graph ofy equals cotangent X but we'll subtracttwo to simply move that graph down twounits and I would say that's probablyyou know again a rough sketch here butto me I would say this is probablyexactly the equation that would describethis graph again we don't need anycoefficient on the X because the periodhasn't been changed there's no sort ofhorizontal shift so we don't have toto add or subtract anything from the Xinside the parentheses so I get nothingtoo bad just kind of recognizing heythat looks like the original cotangentjust move down a little bit
