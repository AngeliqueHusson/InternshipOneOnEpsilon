g'day and welcome to the tech mathchannel what we're going to be having alook at in this video is we are going tobe looking at how to master your timestables especially your upper timestables are under 10 and this would beyou'll be able to do this in under 10minutes you'll be able to get much muchbetter at these this is a great littletrick now it does require a couple ofthings that requires you first off it'sreally really handy with these to knowyour ones twos threes times tables okaywe're going to be looking at how you canmaster say is sevens your eights herenineseven your sixes pretty rapidly but we'llbe good to know your ones twos andthrees types times tables it's alsoreally good to be able to add andsubtract pretty simple numbers okay sowe have much further ado we'll get intothese and I'll show you how the trickI'm working these out so what about togive you an example say I was asking tocalculate seven times nine okay nice andeasy I'll move it up there a little bitand we want to work this out now firstoff the way we do this trick is asfollows underneath I'm just going towrite how far these numbers are from 10so this seven here is three away from 107 plus 3 is 10 this 9 here far away isthat from 10 that's one away ok so thattwo numbers underneath alright that'sour first step the second step is we'regoing to subtract these numbersdiagonally and I'll show you what I meanby this okay so this means either we'regoing to take 1 from 7 or 3 from 9 it'sgoing to give us the same answer that'sgoing to be the first part of our answerok so 7 take away 1 is 6 the same way 9take away 3 is 6the next thing we do is we're going tomultiply these two numbers here okay so3 times 1 is 3 and that is our answerpretty easy right yeah so as steps we'regoing to do first off remember we seehow far we are from 10 they can we writethose underneath we then diagonallysubtract and then we multiply thesebottom numbers but they're really reallyeasy numbers to multiply okay what aboutI I give you another example here I didsay this is going to be nicely did youknow I hit alright what about we haveanother look here and we'll have a lookat what about 8 times 7 okay so firstoff what we do is we see how farunderneath 10 we are so this is 2 under10 and this is 3 under 10 okay the nextthing we diagonally subtract to 70k 2 is5 or 8 take away 3 is also 5 and then wemultiply these two numbers 2 times 3 is6that's pretty cool right it's a reallyreally easy way of working these out Itell you what I'll give you a couplemore of these to practice and then we'llwe'll call that a day almost all reckonso what about our couple more of thesewhat about we do nine times nine we donine times sixwe also are going to do seven timessevennow give these a quick go and we'll seehow you go so I'm going to answer thisright now but you can pause the videoand then we'll go through these answersso first off this is one under ten thisis one under ten okayso nine take away one is eight one timesone is one the next one set nine timessix this is nine is one under ten six isfor under ten nine take away four isfive the same way six take away one isfive one times four is fourokay the last one how you going so farprobably good I hope what about thisnext one this is three under ten this isthree under ten okay seven take awaythree it's four then three times threeis ninehow easy is that for learning your timestables now look I still think it'sreally really important that you dolearn your times tables I mean do youneed to learn this up at times tableslook now you've got this methodit means you probably could get awaywith not doing it so you don't have tomemorize your tables like in the pastpossibly because with a little practicewhat happens is you'll do seven timeseight you'll calculate it listen Masonyou're calculated a dozen times you'lljust start remembering the answers andthat sort of deal so you'll have learnedyour times tables all right but it's areally really great method especiallywhen you're starting those particulartimes tables out anyway I hope that wassome help I hope you enjoyed that we'llsee you next time bye
