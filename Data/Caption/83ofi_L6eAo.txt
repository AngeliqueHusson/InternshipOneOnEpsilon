PHIL MORIARTY: We're talking
about something called tau,which is equal to 2 pi.So there's been a huge amount of
debate and discussion aboutthis right across
the internet.There's even a Tau Manifesto.So one of the real advocates
of tau versus pi is ViHart,and I really recommend you
go and visit her videos.Brady might put the link in
somewhere-- maybe down here orup there or over there--
somewhere.For some people, it's
not an issue.And initially, my response
was what are peoplearguing about this?This is total nonsense, because
if you want to usetau, then you just go tau--I'll repeat it-- tau is equal
to 2 pi, and then proceed.It's more than that though,
because, with maths and withphysics, what you want to strive
for all the time isclarity, particularly when
you're teaching this stuff.It's far too easy, if you've
been teaching this for 15years like I have, not to be
able to put yourself in themindset who's doing this
right from the start.And so if you're got
schoolchildren who are comingto trigonometry, who are coming
to angles, who arecoming to pi and circles and
circumferences and radius forthe first time, you do not
want to confuse them.You want to minimize
the confusion.And moreover, in maths and in
physics, a really importantproperty is symmetry.And you want to try and have
the most elegant, concisedescription of something.Here's my very wonky circle.And let's put our
center there.And that's our radius r.And from there to there,
you all know, I hope--let's do it in a different
color--is d.And we define pi, very simply,
as the ratio of thecircumference to the diameter.And this holds true
for any circle,regardless of its size.Pi crops up in very many
different ways.And the first thing we've got
to think about is how wedefine angle.So let's draw another
circle on this verycrumply brown paper.If we start here at this point
and we move around and comeback to the same point, that's
how many degrees, Brady?BRADY HARAN: 360.PHIL MORIARTY: 360 degrees.So there's a much more natural
way of defining an angle.Let's take a circle again.Here's our radius.We're going to call
that r again.And let's say that, instead of
walking all the way around, weinstead walk a distance
r along here.So that's r as well.And we call angles,
conventionally, in physics--you can call it whatever you
like, but conventionally, wedenote it by theta.That angle, when this arc length
is equal to the radius,is equal to 1 radian.OK.So that's a much more natural
definition, because here,we're basing it on
just fundamentalproperties of the circle.Instead of going, well, that's
360 degrees, we're saying thatwhen we go around a certain arc
length which is equal tothe radius, that's a radian.Now, the question is, how many
radians do we get if we go allthe way around the circle?How many radians does
that turn out to be?Well, it turns out to
be 2 pi radians.And the reason is--because you remember that
the circumferencelength is 2 pi r.All right?So 2 pi radians.Here's where the debate
kicks in.Some, particularly
Bob Palais--I hope I've pronounced
that right.It all stems from
this wonderfulpaper, "Pi is Wrong"--Bob Palais.What he argued--well, isn't this rather
confusing?So you go around one turn, and
instead of being pi radians,it's 2 pi radians.I have a daughter who's
nine and anotherdaughter who's six.And my daughter who's nine is
starting to look at shapes andstarting to look at angles,
doing basic geometry.And I can see how this is going
to be a big problem.I'm looking around
for the paper.And what we're going to do now
is we're going to look at anumber of different angles.So we define angles
counterclockwise.So we go that way rather
than that way.Quite why we do that,
I have no idea.It's convention.Here's where it gets
interesting.0 radians--exactly the same.We go around a quarter
of the circle.That angle is not pi over 4.It's pi over 2.That's already confusing.We go around the circle
a bit more.Instead at of being pi over 2,
because we've gone half wayaround, it's pi.And here, it's 1 and 1/2 pi--3 pi over 2--and here, it's 2 pi.A natural unit is one turn.A natural unit is you
go around once.And yet, when you go around
once, that's 2 pi.Now, I think that's confusing,
not just at a basic elementarylevel, but that use of 2 pi
instead of pi or instead ofsomething which represents one
turn, which represents onerevolution--well, let's just
redefine that.Let's say that tau
is equal to 2 pi.One turn is equal to 2 pi.And let's just put the
pi thing to one side.So that's one turn.So we start off with 0.How far have we gone?Well, we've gone a quarter
way around.We've done a quarter
of a revolution.That's tau over 4--much more natural.This is tau over 2.Because we've gone halfway
around, it's natural.What's this one, Brady?BRADY HARAN: That's going
to be 3/4 of tau.PHIL MORIARTY: Exactly.And this one's going to be tau,
and then 2 tau and 3 tauand 4 tau and 5 tau.And that's much more natural.And of course, any professional
physicist ormathematician or scientist is
going to go, well, it'sstraightforward.If I want to use that, I just
write that and I continue myequation, my analysis.I continue my derivation
using tau.But that's not the point.It's not about the professional
physicists.It's about teaching
this stuff.2 pi appears throughout physics,
all the way from thevery large scale, all
the way rightdown to quantum mechanics.And I'll get on to quantum
mechanics in a sec.Let me show you a simple
demo, first of all.Mass on a spring--we let that bob up and down, it
performs something which isthe bane of so many first year
undergraduates' lives inphysics, which is called
simple harmonic motion.It goes up and down.What describes that?Oh, we call it circular
motion.And what describes that
is a sine wave.And the period of that motion,
again, is 2 pi.In terms of how atoms vibrate,
atoms vibrateall the time in molecules.We describe that in terms
of an angular frequency.We describe in terms of a
frequency, but often, we usesomething called omega, which is
an angular frequency, whichis 2 pi times f.And this is where it gets
really, really interesting,because even as physicists, we
even extract out that factorof 2 pi, because we
have somethingcalled Planck's constant.It's a fundamental constant
that crops up throughoutquantum mechanics.And we actually redefine it.And we have got something
called h-bar.And h-bar is equal
to h over 2 pi.And one of the reasons this 2
pi factor crops up time andtime again throughout physics
is that when we get down tothe quantum level, matter
behaves like a wave.It's got oscillatory motion
associated with it.It moves back and forth
with a period.We can describe that in terms
of waves, which havea period of 2 pi.It crops up absolutely
everywhere.Here's my favorite equation.That is called Fourier
transform.And as you'll see, you've
got 2 pi here.But, not only do you
have 2 pi there--that's an omega, which is 2 pi
f-- you've got a 2 pi factorand there's another
omega up here.What that does--BRADY HARAN: That's got
2 pis everywhere.PHIL MORIARTY: That's got 2
pis absolutely everywhere.Now, what we could do--and you can just replace this
instead of having 1 over root2 pi, have 1 over tau here,
have 1 over root tau.That's not the point.I really don't think
that's the point.If you go to the various
websites--where are they?The tau manifesto and
the pi manifesto--and they have this game
where they bat eachother back and forth.Look, this equation's more
simple if you put tau and thisequation's more simple
if you put pi in.That's not the point.It's about the fundamental
teaching of this.For professionals physicists,
we're notgoing to change this.I really do not think we are
going to change this.If you open up any textbook,
there's a 2 pi.2 pi there, actually.There's one already
earlier on.So open a book up at random.You're very, very likely in a
first-year physics textbook orin any physics textbook
to come across a 2 pi.We are not going to change
these textbooks.That's not the point.The point is when you're
teaching this stuff, tau is abetter representation,
is a better concept.The idea that you do one turn
and that's tau, as opposed to2 pi radians.That's just a much better
way of explaining it.BRADY HARAN: If no one's going
to change, why are we eventalking about it?Are just we just saying this is
what we should have done?PHIL MORIARTY: Yes, it is what
we should have done.Euler, I think, possibly had an
opportunity to change thishundreds of years ago.We should have done it.We haven't done it.Perhaps we could, from this
point onwards, think aboutwriting textbooks and at
least mention tau.I think what we need
to do is you can--perhaps in a textbook like this,
throughout it's going totalk about 2 pi.But we could say right at the
start that there is thisconcept of tau--many students find
it very helpful--and introduce it.And perhaps, then, there
will be a gradualevolution towards tau.I doubt it.I really doubt it, but it might
be nice to think so.-You've got to keep in your
mind when you're doingcalculations--and actually, if you're a
seasoned mathematician--PHIL MORIARTY: --the sampling
and the effects and frequencyshifting to get it into
the right pitch.But I'll play you Vi's vocals
again, because they are reallyquite neat, if I can
find the channel.-And also, that 1/2's here,
because the half tells yousomething.-This works out just as nicely.
