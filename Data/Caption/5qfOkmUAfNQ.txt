hello my name is Maria wheeler from MattMontcalm and this is mathie my assistantand mascot in this lesson we're going tostudy measuring in each ease to thenearest 1/8 inch and also measuring incentimeters and millimeters and I intendthis lesson for about third or fourthgrade level okso children have already been measuringat least in ho centimeters and maybeknit to the nearest 1/4 inch before thisand here I drew a really big ruler thisruler is for measuring to the nearest1/4 inch and let's see what it has thesenumbers signify the whole inches fromhere here would be one whole each andthe blue marks signify the half inchmarks so from here to here is 1/2 inchthen from here all the way to here isone and a half inches right and then thegreen little tick marks are for the 1/4inch increments so from here to here is1/4 inch from here to here is 1/2 inchbut it is also to thoughts of an inchand then from here to here is 3/4 of aninch so this red line here actuallymeasures exactly 3/4 of an inch likethat now let us practice a little I willextend this 3/4 of an inch line a littlelonger and let's see how long it becomeslet's see I drove up till here now howlong is it can you tell there's onewhole inch up till here then 1/4 of aninch so now it is 1 and 1/4 inches andlet's make it all the way here how longis it now ok we go past the 2 inch markso it is 2 inches and the blue mark isthe half inch mark 2 and 1/2 one moreover there how long is it nowwe will have three inches and then overhere three fourths right 3 and 3/4inches now in this ruler we have thesame marks as here the blue marks arethe half inch marks and then the greenones are the 1/4 inch marks 1/4 and thenthen 3/4 so and then I've added one tickmark in between each that was there nowwe have a rule that measures to thenearest 1/8 inch okaythis inch here is divided into eightparts now so therefore each littleincrement is 1/8 of an inch okaythis distance here would be 1/8 of aninch and from here the view is twoeighths of an inch which at the sametime is also 1/4 of an inch and fromhere to here would be 3/8 of an inchfrom here to here is four eighths or 1/2and from here 3/8 5/8that's my redline 5/8 of an inch and so6/8 and 7/8 and then eight eighths orone whole each okay let's do the sameI'll draw a few lines let's say we havea line up to Leah can you tell how longit is there one inch and then thislittle increment is running one and oneeighth of an H let's say it goes overhere we have one inch then the greenmark here it was for the 1/4 inchincrements so we have 1/4 1/4 1/4 or 3/41 and 3/4 inches and how about one moreover there now we go past the two inchmark so there's 2 inches here and thenyou can count 1 2 3 4 5 67/8 of an inch all you can notice thatit is the last tick mark before thethree inches and these tick marks werefor the one eight inches so it must be 78 2 and 7/8 inches okayalso on children to learn to measure incentimeters and millimeters so thisruler is for that and this of coursehope centimeters of course this is drawnto a much bigger scale than in real lifeokay but it is so that you can see it onthe video clearly these are marks forthe hole centimeters then this littlething is here of all the millimetersthere's ten little millimeters in eachcentimeter remember that ten millimetersin one centimeter let me write that downone centimeter is equal to tenmillimeters millimeters the millimetersare the tiny things here let's see myline here how long is it it has two holecentimeters it goes past two centimetermark then a little bit further how manylittle tick marks one two and three sothis line is 2 centimeters threemillimeters flow you have to write itlike thattwo centimeters three millimeters or youcould also write it in whole millimetersbecause here would be 10 millimeters isanother 10 total 20 and then three morethat is also equal to 23 millimeters letme continue it a little bit and let'smeasure another line here up till herecan you see how long is it can youmeasure with this ruler we go past 4centimeters so it's 4 centimeters andthen we need to check these little marksI'm going to now check how many littlemarks it is missing from the next holecentimeter that's too little too littlemillimeters lacking so to speak from 5centimeters so that must be 8 here 4centimeters8 millimeters okay which is also 48millimeters remember each one of these is tenmillimeters 10 20 30 40 and 848millimeters and of course students needto practice this by measuring linesmeasuring objects so they becomefamiliar with both kinds of measuringboth kinds of rulers but now let's go onI don't Mattie here what do you thinkMassie did I enjoy the well this ispretty well okay and we're going tomeasure how long message picture is andstudents might enjoy this exercise stillif they draw if they sketch the favoritestuffed animal and then measure how longit is I'll just measure the animalwithout drawing it okay I'm going to usethis ruler and first measure in incheslet's just measure the longest distanceI can find from the tip of the tail tillthe tasks okay you may not be able tosee it but it is eleven and a halfinches let's make a masse also incentimeters and millimeters my rollerhere actually doesn't Mark themillimeters it is max centimeters and1/2 centimeters but let's trysix twenty nine and a half or it wouldbe twenty nine centimeters fivemillimeters about and you can do thesame with your stuff then then draw aline that is these lengths but beforebefore I draw it with the ruler I'mgoing to estimate I'm going to guess andwhen sometimes it's kind of estimate howlong would it be anything it would befrom here to know maybe here that's myguess 4 8 and 1/4 inches but now I'mgoing to draw it exactly okaymy guess is way too long I guessed alittle bit over 10 inches 10 and a halfinches in reality I have to go to 8 andthen 1/4 inch there that's how long itis in reality let me do the same withthislet me first guess how long will it be32 centimeters and 5 millimeters I don'tknow maybe over there now let me checkdraw it exactly oh I got it really closeuncle didn't it - just a little bitlonger would open is 32 centimeters fivemillimeters and lastly we will practicea little bit converting betweencentimeters and millimeters here fivecentimetres to millimetres how manymillimeters is it to simply rememberthat each centimeter is ten millimetersso he has 50 millimeters and two more so52 and here 21 centimeters okayeach centimeter is 10 millimeters so Imultiply this times 10I get 210 millimeters and then sevenmore in fact it is very easy I'll justcopy these digits to 1/7 over there as ashortcut but now the other way 18millimetersmany centimeters is it and maybemillimeters leftover this is easybecause each 10 millimeters makes acentimeter so we have here 8 centimetersand then 72 millimeters while 70millimeters is exactly 7 centimeters andthen the 2 millimeters are left over soto speak and similarly here 245millimeters 240 millimeters is exactly24 centimeters and here's 5 millimetersoh that is easy I hope this video wasalso helpful
