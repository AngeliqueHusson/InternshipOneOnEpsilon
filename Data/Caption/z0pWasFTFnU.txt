we looked at a bunch of ID's yesterdayand the reason why what are you talkingabout yeah even though it's like whatonly two lessons in is because datastatistics I feel this is just mypersonal sort of vibe from the subjectfrom this coming is that more than anyother of the parts of the course strainsof course you've done it sees it kind oflike a grade of mismatch ofideas like what do any of these have todo with each other and you can kind offold this type of learning that we gothrough although it's understanding thembut not getting the fact that there areall connected in these very veryfundamental ways so yesterday we focusedon three main ideas and they all sitaround the idea of questions now cananyone remind me you can if you canremember around questions what kinds ofthings did we learn about the kinds ofquestions you would pose in a surveyunder data and statistics we asked threesimple questions about questions do youwant yeah okay so we looked at differentkinds of questions right lots of lots ofdifferent kinds so we said I'm gonna putit here we said what kinds of things canyou ask what kinds of things can you askso we looked at all the differentcategories of questions at which therewere many different kinds okay what elsedid we talk about with regard toquestions not just what ah good yeah wedid in the second group we talked aboutthe people right so we talked about whoyou're gonna ask in the problems and tryto get an accurate data sit we'll comeback to that in a minute there's onemore thing yeah very good so in terms oflike once you have your questions youdon't either you want to ask that wayyou convey those questions there's lotsof different options right and they tendto be kind of um sort of grouped intoall that ordered in terms of what costand practicality okay now just to drillinto these ideas a little further underthis idea of what based on the kinds ofquestions you ask on a survey you willget different kinds of data out of thatand you might recall we drew a funkylooking tree diagramsomething like this now we don't have torehearse the whole thing but just sothat we can refresh our memory therewere two main categories of types ofdata that you would get out of differentkinds of services they don't rememberwhat they wereokay very good cat a carp categoricalwhich is basically you know words andalso quantitative which was basicallynumbers rightthen within categorical and clutteragain we had more sub categories so so Iwant to tell me yeah very good sonominal is just when you've got wordsokay and is there order to themwhatsoever like I color versus ordinalwhere it's like the quality of a bookyou know it's like it's poor decentquite good brand-new and you can putthem on a scale right say it again sonominal order and all those peoplemoving yesterday don't need to copy ofit is that because you have them flop uptree diagram I just want to refresh yourmemorywell I'm just try to remind you of likeI said about this thing like I thinkthis is just enough of a cue that youcan remember what the bits are hey youshould have this tree you should alreadyhave this written on a quantitative fivenumbers okay yeah good it's the kind ofnumbers you're dealing withso you've got like a count of some typelike your carry the number of people thenumber of siblings or the number ofwhiteboard markers those are separatenumbers right so we call them discretequantitative alternately if you'remeasuring something counting versusmeasuring we call that continuous doesso if you measure a weight or youmeasure our height or you measure ouranything basically it can be on a rangeright so we had continuous data underthat kind of idea okay very goodso the the pieces of feed is yeah nowlet's come back to this food questionbecause we spent a while under this wesaid ideally obviously if you want toget done you want to get all the datayou want to get a complete set you wantto ask absolutely everyone that yourquestions are related to and what's thatcalled the group of people who ever it'severyone that your questions are relatedit has two words in it who are thepeople it's that I think I heard it thetarget population right now if you getthe entire target population right youask questions to all of them that wecall that a census right but if you onlyhave like a part of the targetpopulation then we call it a simple okayand more often than not this is alreadyresort to god that's really hard to do acensus which is why we only do one everyfive years okay so now you have allthese pieces together you might be ableto be able to understand what we'relooking at today three ideas and theyall fit under here because there aresamples and then there are samples sothere are three kinds of samples we'regonna look at today in the scheme of therest of this diagram I'm gonna give youthe a cutest one and then we'll explorethem one at a time then our s and s yesyes no not air bags I do get find outwhat SRS stood for actually stands forsupplemental restraint system as in whathappened to him your seatbelts I don'tknow
