are the triangles shown below congruentsimilar or neither so for two trianglesto be congruent they have to have thesame size and shape or another way tothink about it is if you were to rotateor flip one shape could you make itcoincide with the other or another wayto think about congruent is especiallyin the case of triangles is all of thecorresponding sides and angles have tobe the same so right over here we seeone side on this shorter on the smallertriangle is five here it's 7.5 actuallyall of these sides here are 5 all ofthese sides are 7.5 so clearly these twotriangles do not have the same sidelengths so it is not congruent andactually you can figure that out just bylooking at them that they are not thesame size that this is a larger trianglethan this one over here so they cannotbe congruent similarity on the otherhand two triangles can be similar evenif they are different sizes as long asthey are the same shape and when we talkabout the same shape there's two ways tothink about it one is is that the ratiobetween corresponding side lengths arethe same or that all of thecorresponding angles are congruent toeach other so we could look and thisright over here this little mark saysthat this angle is equal to this angleis equal to this angle and we know thatthe sum of the angles in a triangle haveto add up to 80 if these 3 I start hadto have to add up to 180 and these 3 areall the same three things adding up to180 each of them have to be 60 degreesbut that's also going on over here thisangle is equal to this angle is equal tothis angle they all have to be they allhave to be 60 degrees so for these twotriangles all of the correspondingangles are the same and in fact all ofthe angles are the same so because ofthat we can say that it is similaranother way to think about it is thatthe ratio of corresponding sides is thesame so if we say that this side j/kcorresponds to side zy and here we cankind of take our pick because all thesides have the same length we say theratio between these two sides so JK overzover Z y is equal to five over sevenpoint five and that's the same ratio asKL as KL over Y X so that is equal to KLover Y X which is five over seven pointfive and that that's also the same ratioas JL over ZX that's the same as JL overZX so two ways to think about it youcould say hey look all of thecorresponding angles are the same andyou actually only have to look at two ofthe angles because if two of them arethe same the third one's going to be thesame all of the corresponding angles arethe same that by itself tells you it'ssorry that by itself tells you it issimilar and on top of that another wayto think about it is the ratio betweencorresponding sides are the same so thisis a simply two triangles are similarnow one thing I want you to realize acongruent triangle is a little bit morestrict it's kind of a similar trianglewhere all of the sides are also the samelength really all of the correspondingfeatures are the same size so allcongruent triangles if something is iftwo triangles are congruent they aredefinitely going to be similar if twotriangles are similar they might becongruent but not necessarily I guessone way to think about it if you thinkabout the universe of similar trianglesif you think about the universe ofsimilar triangles congruent trianglesare a subset of that so everythingthat's congruent is similar to trianglesare congruent to each other they'regoing to be similar to each other buttwo triangles that are similar to eachother may or may not be congruent
