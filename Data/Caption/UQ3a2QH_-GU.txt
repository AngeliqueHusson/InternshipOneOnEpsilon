okay in this video I want to talk aboutthe greatest integer or the floorfunction I like to think of it as thefloor function because it reminds me alittle bit more about what to dosomehow greatest confuses me so thegreatest integer or the floor functionit says basically it says whatevernumber you put in there it will round itdown to the nearest integer okay so whatdoes that mean well we can always graphand let's also plot some points so thefirst one I'm going to look at here isgoing to be y equals the floor of X soif we start plotting points here sohere's X and here's why if I plug in sayzero point five you look at the firstwhole number that's less than or equalto that number well if you look at orequivalently just like we said if youround it down to the nearest wholenumber you'll just get zero likewise ifI plug in zero point six if I round itdown to the nearest whole numberI'll get zero if I plug in zero pointsevenI'll get zero likewise you know if I goup to nine nine again if I round thatdown to the first whole number it'll bezero likewise if I plug say even zero inif you round that down to the nearestwhole number that's less than or equalto that number we also get zero so ifyou want to graph this basically whatyou're doing is just kind of choppingoff the decimal part that's another wayto think about it so it says the graphwill extend all the way over until youget to one but now if you think aboutthe same idea if we go to graph pointsokay when I plug one in the first wholenumber that's less than or equal to 1 is1 so that means my graph is now going tojump up hereand just continue this process if youplug in 1.1 the first hole number lessthan or equal to that is 1 you know I'mpicking stuff at random 1.7 again if youkind of chop off the decimal part you'rejust left with 1 again up to 1 point 9 9that'll still give me 1 if I chop offthe decimal part so this will just be aflat line until I get to 2 and the samethings going to happen once I get to 2you know if I think of the first wholenumber that's less than or equal to 2well the first whole number that's lessthan or equal to 2 is just 2 and this isgoing to extend over in the same mannerit'll just go over a little circle willjump up at 3 it'll start at 3 it'll goover and it'll just keep keep thislittle stair step pattern up let's thinkabout if we maybe plug in a few negativenumbers so if we plug in a couplenegative numbers here suppose I plug innegative 0.5 well the first hole numberthat's less than or equal to negative0.5 would actually be negative 1 samething if you plug in negative 0.6 wewould get negative 1 if I plug innegative 0.9 I'll get negative 1 if Iplug in negative 1 the first hole numberthat's less than or equal to that willbe negative 1 so for all of thesenumbers it said I'm basically gettingthis little portion of the graph nomatter what number I plug in betweennegative 1 up to but not including 0 itsays that'll give me negative 1 outlikewise I could pick maybe a coupleother numbers I think hopefully you kindof see the pattern at this point if youplug in negative 1.5 the smallest numberthat's less than or equal to that wouldbe negative 2 so when I'm here atnegative 1.5 I'll have a dot down hereat negative 2 likewise at negative 1.6it's negative 2 etc etc etc so this iswhy this floor function or the greatestinteger phonemakes this little it's sometimes calleda step function as well because it lookslike little stair steps so that's thebasic idea and now we have graphed thefunction again notationally sometimesthey'll put it with kind of that lookslike it's in braces or sometimes we'lljust write it like where the the toparms aren't there means the exact samething okay so now once you understandkind of that basic part of the greatestinteger function to graph these othertwo would be relatively easy if you alsoknow about graph transformations andI've got definitely a couple of othervideos where I do graph transformationsso you may want to take a look at thosebut just as a refresher so let me erasethe step function that we have here thatwe no longer need okay so you may wantto you know you may want to cop you maywant to backtrack the video and writedown a copy of that greatest integerfunction so that you know you can kindof compare it to what we're graphingthis time remember if you replace theX's on the inside with X minus 3swhat is going to happen to your graph inthat case okay so you may want to lookat my video about horizontal andvertical shifts if you replace the Xwith X minus 3 it actually shifts theoriginal graph it's going to shift theoriginal graph of the greatest integerfunction to the right three units soinstead of starting at zero andextending over to one it's going tostart at three so I move it over one twothree and then it'll go over to fourokay and then now this little steppattern will start over okay so thiswould correspond to the x coordinatefive and then it'll just backtrack theother way as well okay so kind of everyone unit every one unit and this thispattern would would continue okay andyou can kind of plot points again justto check and make sure that this makessense I mean if we're graphing now thestep function suppose I plug in x equalssay three point five well if I plug itinto the bars I'm going to get threepoint five minus three it says on theinside I'm going to get the floor ofthree point five minus three but that'sthe floor of 0.5 and again if you thinkabout the first number that's less thanor equal to 0.5that'll be zero so it says when we plugin three point five I should get the ycoordinate of zero out okay so that'swhy we get again this basic graph againreally the easiest thing I think is tothink about it in terms of graphtransformations so last but not leastlet's graph our floor function minus twoand again if you have seen the graphtransformations you'll know that all theminus two does to it is now it moves theoriginal graph down to complete unitsokay so let me just put a couple littlemarkings on hereso instead of starting at zero zero likeit did before and extending over now ifI move it down two units it'll start atnegative two and then it'll extend overokay and likewise when I'm at one it'llbe one level above and a circle so thisis two three four five the same thingit'll jump and move over it'll jump andmove over jump andmove over and this pattern again willalso continue on the left side just likebefore okay so it's the basically theexact same graph it just gets shifted alittle bit up or down or left and rightokay so I hope these couple exampleshelp to make a little bit of sense outof the greatest integer functionhonestly it's a function that you don'tsee that much of so if it gives you alittle bit of issues hopefully it'll goaway soon and you probably won't have tomess with it again too terribly much soall right if you have any questions feelfree to send an email to my YouTubeaccount and if I can I'll try to get toit but I'm getting inundated with callsand emails so don't hold your breath butI'll do what I can all right good luckout there
