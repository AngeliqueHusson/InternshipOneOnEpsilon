[Music]okay so today I want to talk about whyone is generally not thought of as aprime the first thing I want to talkabout is the intuition behind what aprime is so if you think about a numberlike six you can write it as two timesthree in other words you can sort ofbreak it down into smaller numbers so itfeels like six should not be primewhereas if you take a number like sevenyou can't break it down any further Imean I guess some of you will say youcan write seven is seven times one butit feels like that shouldn't reallycount because the seven is still inthere so seven counts as a prime and ifyou think in these terms it feels likeone should be a prime because you can'tbreak down one any further sointuitively it feels like one should beprime now I've done some research and Ilooked through certain YouTube videosand I found a number of differentexplanations given as to why one shouldnot be a prime now one of theexplanations that I've seen is that inthe technical definition of what makes aprime people say that a prime number isa number that has exactly two factorsone and the number itself and one hasonly one factor in other words one sothey say that one therefore should notbe prime now I don't like this becauseit feels extremely technical andrequiring that a prime number haveexactly two factors that fact doesn'tfeel like it has anything to do with theintuition behind what makes a prime aprime it feels like it's just atechnicality designed to exclude thenumber one but there's no reason why weshould want to exclude the number oneanother explanation that I've seen quiteoften is that it has to do with thisidea of unique factorization so I'm sureyou've heard of this theorem it'sextremely extremely useful it doesn'tget as much credit as I think itdeserves but let's say you take a numberlike 350 and you can write 350 as aproduct of primes you can write 7 times5 times 5 times 2 and if you tell me youhave also factored 350 as a product ofprimes I know yours and my factorizationwill be exactly the same I mean yournumbers might be shuffled as compared tomine but it will be exactly the same andthe issue that people say arises if youcount 1 as a prime is that you might sayaha I actually do have a differentfactorization it's 1times seven times five times five timestwo and I want to be able to say in thatcontext that hey like that's notactually different and to exclude thissort of weird case people exclude onefrom being a prime now this explanationis good but not great and the reason forthat is how hard would it be to say thatthis person you know one doesn't countit just in this context you know pleaseyour factorization will be the same asmine as long as you're notchucking ones in the middle or somethinglike that another reason I don't likethis explanation is that it's also ahistoric so people for a very long timeincluding some incredibly famousmathematicians did count one as a primeso one example would be if you look atgh Hardy's book in the 1930s gh Hardy ifyou know is an incredibly incrediblyfamous analytic number theorist and evenin the 1930s he had no problem in histext books writing one is a prime and Iguaranteed that this man knew aboutunique prime factorization and it didnot seem to bother him enough to excludeone from being prime so it leaves thequestion what is the real reason well Iaccept the idea that of course onecannot be broken down any further into aproduct of other numbers the same way anumber like say six can however there isone thing about the number one thatmakes it very special that distinguishesit from the other so-called Prime's andthat is that one divides every positivewhole number so for example take yourfavorite positive whole number like say12 then if you write down the equationone times x equals 12 you can alwaysfind a positive whole number X thatsatisfies this equation and of courseit's quite clear that number is 12 andthis always works no matter what numberyou pick to put on the right-hand sideyou can always find a positive wholenumber X that solves this equation nowthis property is so special that numberswith this property in other wordsnumbers that divide every other numberin a system are usually called units andwhat I'm gonna try and convince you ofis that being armed with this concept ofa unit and having it be separate fromprimes will allow you to make sense ofwhat a prime is and what uniquefactorization is in a number of contextsthat you may not have previously thoughtof before let me give you an example solet's sayyou wanted to expand into the realm ofboth positive and negative numbers sowhen I think about breaking a numberdown I'm allowed to use both positiveand negative numbers so let me ask you aquestion is seven still prime in thiscontext it might seem like it should bebut I'll point out that you can write 7as 7 equals negative 1 times negative 7now this might confuse you of courseunless you are aware of the concept of aunit see the thing is like one with thepositive whole numbers negative 1 alsodivides everything if you set up theequation negative 1 times x equalssomething you can find an integer X thatalways satisfies that equation so yousee when you think about what makessomething a prime you should think aboutit in terms of a prime as a number thatcan't be written as the product of twoother numbers both of which are notunits breaking it down as a productinvolving a unit shouldn't count formuch because of course units divideeverything also having the concept of aunit at hand makes unique primefactorization clear here as well forexample if I take a number like 6 I cansay it's written as 2 times 3 and if yousay to me ah but I have a differentfactorization of this number look at itit's negative 1 times 2 times negative 3I can say that yours and myfactorization are actually the samebasically because all you've done ismaybe you switch the order around a bitand you sprinkled some units on top nowmany of the places that these conceptscome up are extremely advanced butthere's one more example I'd like togive you simply because I can't resistthose of you who have taken high schoolalgebra may have encountered polynomialsbefore and you may have noticed thatsometimes you can write a polynomial asa product of two smaller degreepolynomials and sometimes you can't andI'm sure this is already soundingfamiliar because it turns out that thesenotions of prime and uniquefactorization extend into the realm ofpolynomials as well so it turns out thatif I factor say a real polynomial if ifactor a polynomial with realcoefficients and you factor the samepolynomial with real coefficients yoursand my factorizations will be exactlythe same except once again you may haveswitched the order around a bityou may have you know sprinkled someunits into the mix now since I don'twant to get too deep into this I willleave it to you to figure out what theunits are in this context and whatunique prime factorization looks like inthis context I think it's really fun tothink about thatso to summarize having this concept of aunit and a prime and keeping these twothings separate will give you way moreconceptual mileage than it would if youmix them up it will allow you todistinguish Prime's it will allow you tothink about unique prime factorizationin any number of algebraic contexts thatyou may encounter in your life of courseit might happen one day that you mightexplore mathematical realms or playmathematical games of your own and if itso happens that in the context ofwhatever game you're playing it doesn'treally make sense to keep one separatemaybe you're not doing the types ofthings that I was talking about you'redoing something completely different andwith whatever you're doing you findyourself having to write things like letP be a prime or one over and over againand if you find yourself in such asituation please at the start of yourpaper you can just write in this paperI'm going to allow one to be a prime andno one will blame you as long as whatyou're doing is clear now hope all ofthat made sense let me know in thecomments if it didn't and do not forgetto like this video share it with afriend and
