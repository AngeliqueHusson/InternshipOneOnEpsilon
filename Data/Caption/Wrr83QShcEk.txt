g'day I'm James what would you buy frontyard a beautiful Arizonathat's a lovely evening here better sitdown enjoy it both icky baths inmathematics I'll sit in my chair providebooks on my table and have a grand timetonight except I have a problem my tablehere is on this rough ground is nicelystable but my chair is not it's allwobbly I don't like sitting on wobblychairs so I've got a problem if I'mwandering out what's different betweenmy table and my chair we might noticethat in my table has three legswhereas my chair has four and that turnsout to be the key difference in fact nomatter where you put a three-leggedobject on the groundoh don't always be stable which is kindof curious and obviously chairs need notbe that way what's going on well thefact is three legs are good because Ialways put two legs on the ground howrough that ground is and just tilt thetable down until the third leg touchesno worries that assures me a stableposition no matter where I choose to putthe table in fact the camera right nowfilling me is on a tripod tripod threefeet there deliberately three footedbecause you know how rough the ground asyou can always find a stable positionwith a tripod in fact in the olden dayswe want to milk the cow you got atreadle of milking stool and stools backthen were always three-legged becausewere how rough the barn floor was athree-legged stool will always be placeddown in a stable position no matterwhere you wanted to put it greatfour-legged objects clearly not so whatcan I do about my fall they couldproblem here with the chair I have amath problem if that I can see there's alovely way to solve this problem usingmathematics let's do it right now sowhat I've got here I've got definitelytwo stable legs in fact we always canfind two stable legs in this case thisopposite corner are my good leg so I'llcool it's a good legs I'm gonna keephold of those good ones and right nowthis other pair of legs the bad onesthat each hovering just above the groundor they're just hovering above theground I could actually make them touchthe ground if I could send up push thischair down make my good legs go belowand have these ones be good and be onthe ground instead but I can actually dothat because this is on rock right now Ican't actually push this into the groundbut that does tell me I could make anypair of legs I want good like maybepushing the chair into the groundso right now okay my good diagonal pairperfectly surface for this rough groundmy bad pair above when we do now is takethis chair on a journey I'm just goingto move it around but not bring it backthe same spot it was on before but I'mgonna make sure I've switched the rolesof the legs so my good legs which onesI'm still holding my hand and now abovethe ground but they're not good anymoreand the other pair are on the surfaceall right because I just switched theirpositions they're on there's level earththat's where the surface position wasbefore however my good legs are meant tobe good so now push this chair downleast theoretically to make my good pairgood and now the other pair are belowthe ground I think what I just said westart off in a position with my bad pairbut the ground rotate over Taylor nicesmooth continuous way and brought it toposition where I have to can I have thebad pair below the ground that was anice smooth continuous transformationfrom above the ground to below theground there must be some niceintermediate spot where actually the badpair is on the ground for a positivenumber down to negative number I musthave passed through zero so that meanslike good pairs on the ground right nowabove for the bad pair below for the badpair there's some intermediate positionbetween 0 and 90 degrees Oh like thisone we're on the ground and zero abovezero below the ground for the bad pairthat means stable we've just shown onrough groundterney a four-legged object like this atmost 90 degrees you'll find a positionwhere all four legs are stable that isbeautiful now I'm putting the ball ofyour eyes a little bit here the groundI've got here is actually made of rocksit's very discontinuous surface soactually this the arguments regionshould work only for a nice smoothcontinuous service ok because I'm usingsomething called the intermediate valuetheorem here we want anything to be nicesmooth and continuousif this ground was like extremely bumpylike had spikes all over then I gottroubles good despite some of the spotswe can go through the chair I couldn'tdo it at all so there are some caveatswith this but actually mathematicianshave to study this problem and theyanalyzed not just square objects likethis but rectangular tables you canalways be found have a nice position onthe ground that's stable as long as theground isn't too wild keep a continuousdon't make it too spikyand all will be good so there we are sonow I'm all set with my stable chair nowthis thing I put down anyway what isstableI'm now set to have a lovely relaxingevening thinking about some moremathematics all right thanks so muchyou
