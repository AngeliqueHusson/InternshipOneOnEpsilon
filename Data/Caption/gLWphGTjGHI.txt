so welcome to my video on adding mixednumbers here we have 2 and 1/6 beingadded with 4 and 2/3 and the first thingI like to do I wrote this for you ingreen is I like to add the whole numberstogether and then the second thing Ilike to do is I like to add thefractions together so that's what I'mgoing to do now so since we have a wholenumber of 2 in our first mixed numberand we have a whole number a 4 in oursecond mixed number I'm going to addthose 2 whole numbers together in purpleand since we have a fraction of 1/6 inour first mixed number and a fraction of2/3 in our second mixed number I'm goingto add those two fractions together ingreen so now we need to simplify this asmuch as possible the first thing I'mgoing to do is add my 2 whole numberstogether we have 2 plus 4 which is equalto 6 and now we can add the twofractions together however we need tohave common denominators to add orsubtract fractions so since we have adenominator of 6 the denominator of 3 wehave uncommon denominators we need tomake the denominators the same before wecan add these two fractions so if wemultiply 3 times 2 3 times 2 is equal to6 which gives us the same denominator asour other fraction so now we have commondenominators but one thing you have toremember is that whatever you do to thebottom of the fraction you have to do tothe top of a fraction so since wemultiplied the bottom number by 2 wehave to multiply the top number by 2 aswell so now I'm going to simplify my twofractions our first fraction of 1/6stays the same and our second fractionin our numerator we have 2 times 2 whichis equal to 4 and in our denominator wehave 3 times 2 which is equal to 6 sonow that we have a common denominatorthese two fractions can be added quiteeasily since our denominator is 6 whenwe add these fractions together ourdenominator is also going to beand in the top of the fraction we justadd our two numerators one and four andone plus four is equal to five and wecan't forget to bring down our wholenumber of six and we have a final answerof six and five over six so here aresome more videos with some more exampleproblems related to the video you justwatchedI really hope you're finding mytutorials helpful so until my next videoI will see you later
