welcome to another episode of Fort Bendmathematics tutoring take a moment tosoothe your nervesremember these is just numbers theycan't hurt nobodyhello ladies and gentleman this is mr.Whitworth Fort Bend tutoring and today'slesson is about multiplying binomialsthat's right two terms times two termsand here's an example of the format sobasically anytime you have two binomialstwo sets of parentheses with two termseach within them then you can use twodifferent strategies in order to solvethis oneyou can use my favorite which is thedistributive property meaning that I gotmy arrows popping here because that'swhat my arrows do and you would end upmultiplying the first term times bothterms in the second set of parenthesesand you would multiply the second termalso by both terms in the second set ofparentheses therefore you would end upwith these following products you wouldend up with a times C plus a times Dplus B times C plus B times D uh-huh andthat's just simply distributing eachterm in the first set of parenthesestimes everything and the second set ofparentheses which is what I preferhowever they have simplified the processin such a way that they've defined it asthe following mm-hmmthey say that you could multiply thefirst terms together meaning that a andthe C term you can then multiply theouter terms together meaning a times Dthen multiply the inner terms B times Cand finally the last terms in each setof parentheses meaning B times D to endup with fol aka the foil method mm-hmmnow I preferably just simply do thedistributive property because the foilmethod is just something extra forstudents to learn and it's the samething that's right the distributiveproperty multiplying a times C a times DB times C and B times D is the exactsame thing as the foil method ladies andgentlemenso students please understand this aswell as teachers that when learning thefoil method all you're doing isdistributing okay so if you don't wantto have to learn what the F the oh the Ithe L stands for then just simplymultiply everything out and you'll befine just fineall right so let me show you that let'sstart out with the first problem herehere with the problem number one I havethe quantity of X minus 3 times X plus 5so what I'm going to do first andforemost is get my arrows popping allright so I know that I'll be multiplyingthis x times both terms in the secondset of parentheses as well as takingthis negative 3 and multiplying thattimes both terms as well so I'll end upwith the following results x times Xwill be x squared x times 5 is 5x andnotice I circled that negative 3 that'sreminding me that that second term inthe first set of parentheses is negativeso keep up with that all rightso here we'll have negative 3 times Xthat'll give me negative 3x and finallynegative 3 times 5 is negative 15 andfor those of you that love the foilmethod we did the exact same thing asyou we multiply the first terms togethermeaning that x times X we multiply theouter terms meaning x times 5 wemultiply the inner terms and negative 3times X and finally we multiply the lastterm's those second terms in each set ofparentheses that negative 3 and the 5together to get the negative 15 keep inmind that when you're looking for termswhen you're searching for terms termsare always separated by plus or minussigns okay so here in that first set ofparentheses the first term is X secondterm is negative 3 and the second set ofparentheses the first term is X thesecond term is positive 5 now once youfinish distributing you always look tosee if you can combine any like terms sonotice that my middle terms here that 5xand negative 3x they both have X to thefirst power meaning and making them liketerms so let's add them together so I'llbring down my x squared 5x minus 3x isgonna give me a positive 2x and finallyI'd bring down my positive 15 and donethat's it you got it so I'm gonna put ared box around my answer because that'swhat I like to do always so that's theprocess of multiplying binomials allright just like that all right and youknow what I think want to switch up pinshere and so let's pull out this one okayall right there we go for proud numbertwo I have the following I have 2 Xminus 7 times 8x plusso once again I'm gonna start by gettingmy arrows popping I'm gonna circle thatsecond term because it's a negative so Iwon't forget thatand finally I'll start multiplying thisout so 2x times 8x gives me 16x squaredI then have 2x times 1 which is 2x nextI'll have negative 7 times 8x gives me anegative 56 X and then I have negative 7times 1 which is negative 7 once Ifinished multiplying that out I'm gonnawrite my answer in descending order of Xmeaning that I'm gonna start with theterm with the highest exponent and workmy way down so if you're ever concernedabout what order to put your terms inalways write your answer in descendingorder of your variable and less tohdotherwise all right so let's bring downthis 16x squared I'll be combining mymiddle terms together meaning that 2xand negative 56 X that gives me anegative 54 X and I'll bring down thisnegative 7 and that's the answer that'sitI'm gonna put a red box around that okaythere it is you got it so let's keepgoing all right next problem I have thequantity of X minus 5 times 14x minus 3once again I'm gonna give my arrows popin that's right get those arrows pop inladies and gentlemen okay so here we areI'm gonna multiply x times 14x thatgives me 14x squared I have x timesnegative 3 which is negative 3x next wehave negative 5 times 14 X which isnegative 70 X and I also have negative 5times negative 3 remember that anegative times a negative is a positiveso I'll end up with a positive 15 asthat last term once we finishdistributing remember your next thing todo is to combine like terms that's rightso look for any terms that can be addedor subtracted together so we do have ourmiddle terms negative 3x and negative 70which can be combined so I'll bebringing down this 14x squared here andsee like signs you add alright and youkeep the sign of the biggest term so I'mgonna bring down a negative 70 3xlike signs and unlike science attractalways keep the sound of the largestnumber then I'll be bringing down thatpositive 15 all right and that's theanswer let's put a box around that therewe goin problem number 4 we have 4 8 minus 3times 4 8 plus 3 so what I'll be doinghere is I'll be distributing all rightget my arrows popping I'm gonna circlethat second term there because it'snegative all right and it won't alwaysbe negative but anytime that second termis a negative sign I prefer to remindmyself that is negative by putting acircle around it all right thencontinuing on I have 4a times 4a that'llgive me 16 - a squaredmy next will have 4 8 times 3 which isgonna be 12 8 then multiplying negative3 times 4 8 that'll give me a negative12a and then I have negative 3 times 3which is negative 9 notice that wealways will distribute and then combineany like terms that we may have thesetwo middle terms are like terms butthere are also additive inverses meaningthat they're opposites of one anotheranytime you're trying to combineopposites it equals to zero in otherwords these twelve eighty's will cancelout all right they're gone so you'lljust end up with 16 a squared minus 9and this type of binomial here this 16asquared minus 9 is called a differenceof squares a difference of two squaresso if you ever want to figure out how tofactor in other words get back to youroriginal alright that 4a minus 3 times 48 plus 3 go ahead and check out ourvideo on difference of squares ladiesand gentlemen alright so here we'remultiplying but in the other one you'llbe factoring so if you need a lesson onthat check that out alright I'll put alink in the description box alright gooddeal so that's problem number 4 rightand now we're off to the next problemlet's check it out alright for problemnumber 5 we have the quantity of 2mminus 3 squared anytime you have morethan one term inside of a set ofparentheses then you have an exponent onthe outside of it do not repeat do notdistribute the exponent inside theparentheses you can't do thatis not mathematically correct insteadwhat this means is that you have thisbinomial this 2m minus three raised tothe second power meaning you have 2mminus 3 times 2m minus 3 that's rightyou have that quantity that 2n minus 3raised to the second power meaningmultiplying against itself so you mustexpand it in other words your first stepwhen doing a binomial squared is toexpand it and so it will look like theprevious problems that we were dealingwith when we were multiplying a binomialtimes a binomial which means we canapply the distributive property and/orthe foil methodokay so here I'm gonna get my arrowspopping you got it you get those arrowspoppins here okay so let's go ahead andmultiply this out we have 2m times tothem that gives me 4m squared 2m timesnegative 3 is negative 6 mmm negative 3times 2 is negative 6 mm and finallynegative 3 times negative 3 will give mea positive 9 all right so once again anytime you finish distributing you alwayslook to see if you can combine your liketerms those terms that have the exactsame variable with the exact sameexponent on those variables all right solet's bring down our 4m squared firstall right then I'll end up with mynegative 12 mm bringing down thatpositive 9 and done all right so whatare you saying that you don't like that4 and I'll fix it all right I don't knowis that betterall right therefore it's better so wehave four M squared minus twelve M plusnine as your result and that's italright let's go ahead and put a boxaround that so next let's look aroundnumber six for problem number six wehave another binomial squared rememberanytime you have a binomial squaredyou're going to expand it you're gonnarewrite it by multiplying the 4x plus 9Y times itself yea the 4x plus 9 Y sothat's gonna be your first step anytimeyou see a problem such as this do notdistribute the exponent inside of theparenthesis all right that is not theproper way to do itso here we're going to go ahead andmultiply everything out after I get myarrows popping let's not forget to getthose arrows popping and finally thatsecond term is positive right so you'llhave 4x times 4x this gives you 16xsquared you'll have 4x times 9y that'llgive you a 36 X Y notice that I'mwriting my variables in alphabeticalorder and I always do that and thathelps me identify my like terms by theway so here I'll have 9 y times 4x andonce again this will give me 36 X Y andthen finally I have 9 Y times 9 Y whichis gonna give me a positive 81 y squaredonce I've done that I'm going to attemptto combine any like terms I may have andonce again you identify like terms bythose terms that have the exact samevariables with the exact same exponentson those variables and that's exactlywhat we have our middle terms here so wecan combine those so I'll be bringingdown this 16x squared adding our middleterms together we have a positive 72 X Yand finally it'll be a positive 81 Ysquared as the last term there and thisis the answer that's it alright okaylet's check out the next problem allright and problem number seven we havethe quantity of 3x minus y times 2x plus5y so what I'll be doing once again isI'm gonna start out by getting my arrowspopping here second term is negative soI'll be distributing that as well makingsure that Iknow that the second term is negativeand starting out I'm gonna multiply 3xtimes 2x that gives me 6x squared I thenhave 3x times 5y which gives me apositive 15 X Y then multiplyingnegative Y times 2x then gives me anegative 2xy and then finally negative Ytimes 5y gives me a negative 5y squaredalright so next I'm gonna combine mymiddle terms and I'm gonna write myanswer in descending order of X meaningI'm starting with the term that has thehighest exponent on my X variable andthat'll be the first term so this isgonna be the 6x squared then combiningthe 15 XY minus 2xy I end up with apositive 13 X Y and then I'll bebringing down that negative 5y squaredok and that's gonna be the answer therethat's it done and done now it's primenumber seven mm-hmm just like that let'smove on last problem ladies andgentlemen we have problem number 8 hereand in problem number 8 we have 5xsquared y plus 3z times 11 X minus C solet's see what happens with this problemall right so I'm once again got myarrows popping I'm going to distributethat 3z to both terms in a second set ofparentheses so multiplying 5x squared Ytimes 11 X I end up with 55 X cubed Yremember that your exponents when you'remultiplying like bases they add so I hadx squared here I have X to the firstpower here so that 2 plus 1 gives me Xto the third power and then my variableY then I'll be multiplying 5 x squared Ytimes negative Z that gives me negative5x squared Y Z notice how I'm writingthese variables in alphabetical orderthat's rightABCD efg you know the rest right okaythen we're gonna multiply three Z times11x that gives me a positive 33 X Z allright once again the purpose for writingyour variables in alphabetical order isto help you identify any like terms whenyou're finished multiplying so please dothat every time then we'll bemultiplying 3z times negative Z thatgives me negative 3z-squared after we distribute we alwayslook to see if we have any like termslooking at each of these four termsladies and gentlemen you will noticethat every term has a differentcombination of variables and exponentsmeaning that you don't have anyidentical variables with the exact sameexponents on those variables they're alldifferent this first term is X cubed Ysecond term is x squared Y Z the thirdterm is X Z and in the last term as Zsquared so none of these four terms hereare like terms because of that this isour answer we won't be able to add orcombine any of these alright so that'llbe your final result well ladies andgentlemen that does it for I'm mr.whitting Fort Bend tutoring this wasmultiplying binomials as always pleasecomment rate subscribe
