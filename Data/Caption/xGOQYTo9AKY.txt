The first thing you want to do is, you look at the "x" termsbasically that are in there and you want the coefficientyou want the coefficient of the "X" squared term to equal onewhich it does in this caseif not , you have to factor it out.and i'll do something like thatin a separate exampleso we have this condition. What we then do isstick in a set of parenthases with the first two, give yourself a little spaceand then i'm going to write my plus eight, give myself a little space, equals zeroso the whole point of how you complete the square is, you look atwhatever number is front of the "X" term,  so in this case, the number in front of the "X"the coefficient, on the "X " term is one-half (1/2, .5). we then take one half of that number.we always take one half of itso one half of negative six, is negative 3.and then what you do is,you square it, and put that number back inside of there. so if we square itwe get positive nine.okay, so we've actually thrown in a brand new number that wasn't therebefore, we put in this positive nine.that wasn't therethe way we can get rid of it, in this case,is, I mean , basically,you're just getting rid of the parenthasesewe would get back the original thingexcept our plus nine would be therewell to cancel it out,we are going to subtract nine. okay,notice this is all happening on the left side of the equals signokay so now, we just simplify down a little bit moreand the point is, you can write the stuff in parenthases as a perfect squareit actually factors down as "x"  minus three , times "x" minus threeokay, and again, if you take whatever one half of the coefficienton the "X" term was,it was a negative three, that will go into the parenthesis.positive eight minus nine, is negative one.equals zeronow we write the first part, as "x" minus three squaredminus one equals zeroagain, we are trying to solve a quadratic equation here.what we do at this point is you now simplyadd the one to both sidesso "x" minus three squared ,equals positive oneand the whole point of solving a quadratic equation by completing the square,is getting to the step we are at right now'cause what we are going to do is we are going to take the square root ofboth sides, so if we take the square root of both sides, "x" minus threesquared,equals the square root of the right sideokay, so once we take the square roots, we should put a positiveor negative on one sideon the left, if we take the square root,of a quantity squared,you're left with the inside, "x" minus 3equals either positive, or negative one.so now we get our two separate equations that we now have to solveone of the equations we willhave to solve will be x minus 3equals positive  oneand the other equation we'll have to solvewill be x minus three equals negative one.so well will simply add three in both casesand we'll get "X" equals positive four. as one of our solutionsif you add positive three to the other side,we'll get "X" equals positive twoas our other solutionand you can check that if you plug atwo and four into the original equation,you will get zero.alright, so this will be example onein my extra example I will change the coefficienton the x squaredto make it a little more tediousstick around if you need to see that example,  it should be close by
