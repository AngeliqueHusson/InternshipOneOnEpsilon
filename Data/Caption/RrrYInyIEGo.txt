Hello. I'm Professor Von Schmohawk
and welcome to Why U.We have seen that sets of real numbers
can be visualized using the number line.A line is a 1-dimensional objectand the number line represents real numbers
as points in this 1-dimensional space.Every real number corresponds to a
single point in this space and vice versa.In the previous lecture we discussed the
operation of creating a "Cartesian product".In this lecture, we will see
how the Cartesian productallows us to construct mathematical objectswhich correspond to points
in two or more dimensions.As we saw in the last lecture,
the Cartesian product of two sets A and Bis formed by pairing one element
from each set to form ordered pairs.The collection of ordered pairs formed by
the Cartesian product forms a new set.This set contains ordered pairs representing
every possible combination of elementswhere the first element is from set Aand the second element is from set B.The Cartesian product is written using a symbol
which looks like a multiplication symbol.We can display the ordered pairs
of this Cartesian product in a gridto form a simple
2-dimensional coordinate system.By specifying the colors of each elementwe can locate any horizontal and vertical
position within the grid.It is not necessary for each operand of a
Cartesian product to be a different set.For instance, we can form the Cartesian product
of set A with itself.This can be written as
the Cartesian product of A and Aor "A squared".Just as before, we can locate any horizontal
and vertical position within the gridby specifying the colors of each element.Or, if instead of set A containing colored
squares, set A contained numberswe could locate any position in the grid
by specifying the numerical valueof the first and second elements
of an ordered pair.Set A does not have to be
a finite set of numbers.We can also create Cartesian products
of infinite sets.For instance, set A could be
the set of integers Z.Forming a Cartesian product
of the set of integers with itselfcreates an infinite set of ordered pairs
"Z-squared"whose elements are every possible combination
of two integers.Of course, we would need
an infinitely large gridto represent all the ordered pairs in Z-squared.Instead of writing every ordered paireach ordered pair can be represented
by its position in the grideach pair corresponding to a unique point.We can locate the positions of these points
using a pair of number lines.For each ordered pair, the first element corresponds
to a position on the horizontal number lineand the second element corresponds
to a position on the vertical number line.The points formed by the Cartesian product
of the set of integers with itselfform an infinite grid of points
spaced one unit apart.Now, if instead of using
the set of integers Zwe form the Cartesian product
of the set of real numbers R with itselfwe create a continuum of points
which completely fill the plane.Then every ordered pair of two real numberscorresponds to a unique point
in this 2-dimensional space.This system for visualizing
ordered pairs of real numbers as pointsis called the "Cartesian coordinate system".And the elements of an ordered pair
which corresponds to a pointare called the "coordinates" of the point.The ideas which led to this system were developed
by Rene Descartes in his book "La Geometrie".La Geometrie, published in 1637united algebra and geometry
into a single subject "analytic geometry"which describes geometric shapes
by algebraic equations.Likewise, algebraic equations
can be visualized as geometric shapes.This is possible because, as we will soon seealgebraic equations define sets of pointswhich when viewed in the Cartesian
coordinate system, appear as shapes.The perpendicular number lines in the Cartesian
coordinate system are referred to as "axes".The horizontal and vertical axes
are often called the x-axis and y-axis.Sometimes these two axes are referred to as
the "abscissa" and the "ordinate".The point where the axes meet
represents the number zero on each axis.This is called the "origin"
of the coordinate system.The origin corresponds to
the ordered pair (0,0).The infinite plane containing the x and y axes
is referred to as the "Cartesian plane"or the "xy-plane".The axes divide the xy-plane into four regions
called "quadrants".These are numbered from the first to fourthstarting with the upper right quadrant
and continuing counter-clockwise.The quadrants are usually denoted
with Roman numerals.Many mathematicians prefer to draw
number lines and axeswith arrows pointing towards
the positive direction onlyindicating the direction of increasing value.We have seen that the number line
corresponds to the set of real numbers R.So forming the Cartesian product
of the set of real number with itselfis equivalent to forming the Cartesian product
of the number line with itselfto form the Cartesian plane.And just as the number line
consists of a continuum of pointsresiding in 1-dimensional spacewhere each point corresponds to
a unique real numberthe Cartesian plane consists of a continuum
of points residing in 2-dimensional spacewhere each point corresponds to a unique
ordered pair of real numbers.Using a 2-dimensional
Cartesian coordinate systemwe can graphically display sets of ordered
pairs as groups of points in this space.Later we will see how algebraic equations
can describe infinite sets of pointswhich when viewed in this system
appear as shapes in two dimensions.In the next lecture we will see how a 3-dimensional
Cartesian coordinate system can be constructedwhich will allow us to visualize sets of
ordered triples in three dimensions.
