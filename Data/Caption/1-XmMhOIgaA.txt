now this is a frequency table you've hadto construct some of these in theprevious exercise you may have had tohave had like an extra column fortallying and then you can warm up by theend and this is what your result withokay now frequently in fact one of theactual questions on this is on the basisof your frequency table on the basis ofthose guys over therein extra Brian can you add on columnsfor cumulative frequency and relativefrequency alright so how are we going tocalculate these things now there'sactually an order to this so I'll leavethis up in a minute so you can enjoyyour own when it's on but I just wantyou to focus first it makes more senseto work out cumulative frequency firstrather Drella to frequency and as we gothrough it I wonder if you can work outy-cubed a frequency let me come back toour definition here right of cumulativefrequency it's the total up to andincluding each one of those points okayso now if I have a look here candyclicks some kind of lollies I have noidea okaywhy don't we have accumulated frequencyI'm just looking at this column overhere for normal frequency and I'm addingit up as I go so the first one would be1 the second one it's going to be 1 plus5 which is 6 the next one's going to be6 plus 8 which is 14 plus 13 which is 2734 38 okay good so I want you to look atthese numbers now I hope this sort ofrings a bell in terms of its similaritywith when we were constructing fielddiagrams do you remember that we'll walkacross the field and we'd be countingthis the trundle wheeled as a tickedover and you're gonna get these numbersthat get bigger and bigger and biggerright now how does that relate to thesenumbers over here well those numbers onthe left are the ones which is like thedifferences between those okay so allI've done to get the column on the rightis to add up those differences okay nowcan anyone tell me why it makes sense towork out cumulative frequency beforerelative frequency if you need to workout by cut maybe carry back to thedefinition for relative frequency mighthelpyeah very good so if you have a look atthe definition right to find relativefrequency you need the total populationmaybe it's something divided bysomething and you don't know what thetotal population is till you've countedthem up so when I come here I've workedout that the total is 40 so now this isas simple as it gets I'm going to writeeach one as a fraction 36 candy cooks ithappens once out of 40 that's it I couldwrite that that's the two-and-a-halfpercent they might ask you for apercentage it doesn't matter too muchthis is going to be 5 out of 40 which Ican simplify this will be 8 out of 40which I can also simplified 13 out of 4you can I simplify that one nope 13 isprime so I'm stuck 7 out of 40 can Isimplify no 4 out of 42 one on 10 andthen lastly 2 out of 40 which is okayand I'm done I've got all my things herenow you can see I've got some questionsdown here I'll only answer just one ofthem really if I said how many packetscontained 40 or fewer right so what I'mdoing is I'm looking at the cumulativefrequency in saying well where's 40 andwhere is all of the ones including that40 or fewerso here's 40 34 that 34 includes all ofthese numbers does that make sense so mysimple answer to how many packetscontain 40 or fewer the answer is 34 34of them contained 36 or 37 or 38 that'swhat the adding did for me okay
