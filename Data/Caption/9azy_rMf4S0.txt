alright this is going to be one moreproblem about graphing equations bylocating points and in this one andwe're not kind of really quite grapheverything but the idea is again we cankind of plot points so the question iswhich of the following points a B C or Dis not a solution to this equation yequals x squared minus 4x plus 1 andagain to be a solution it means if youplug in this first number for X and ifyou do all the arithmetic we have to getthis number out or why if that doeshappen the point you know for example 01would be a solution so so notice if wetake y equals x squared minus 4x plus 1if everywhere there's an X we plug in 0will notice the first x squared would goaway the negative 4x would go away wewould get the value of y equals 1 sothis first point I claim is a solutionbecause if you plug in 0 we do get oneout so so that point fits in the billlet's check it and really the only thingto do to me is to simply check them sonotice if if we plug in x equals 1 andwe plug in x equals one will get yequals 1 squared minus 4 times 1 plus 11 squared is 1 minus 4 is negative 3negative 3 plus 1 is negative 2 so itsays if you plug one end we get negative2 out so the second point is also asolution that that workslet's see if we plug in negative onewill get y equals negative 1 squaredminus 4 times negative 1 plus 1 negative1 squared is positive one negative 4negative 1 is positive 4 plus 11 plus 4plus 1 that gives me 6 so this C is notcorrect because we found out that if youplug negative one end you should begetting six outs so this point we wouldsay is not a solution to this originalequation and maybe let's just check thelast point just to make sure if we plugin x equals 3 will get y equals 3squared minus 4 times 3 plus 13 squaredis 9 9 minus 12 is negative 3 negative 3plus 1 is negative 2 so yeah if you plug3 and we do get negative 2 out so thatpoint also satisfies the originalequation so so our solution we would sayC is the point that is not a solution toour original given equation
