g'day welcome to the taken math Channelwhat we're gonna be having a look at inthis video is a way of squaring anytwo-digit number that is a way ofmultiplying any two-digit number byitself fairly instantly okay so I sitback and enjoy yeah I'll give you anexample to start off with so how fastcan you do 32 squared I'll give you fiveseconds okay times pretty much up okayhopefully the answer that you get is1,024 and if you did if you got thatthat's pretty cool alright that's that'spretty impressive congratulations that'scorrect if you didn't don't worry I'mgonna show you a way of working this outokay so sit back and you'll pick this uppretty quickly now a couple stepsinvolved in doing this the first onewhat we do is we find the distance welook at this number here the numberbeing squared okay obviously and we formthe distance between this number and thenearest tens number okay so the nearesttens number 232 is 30 so the distancebetween 32 and 30 is total okaynow that's the first step this issomething you can do usually do prettyquickly okay now we use is true forpretty much every step that we're goingto be going on with now okay the firstthing we do is we take this 2 away from32 to get 30 and we add this 2 to 32 toget 34 this is all stuff you can do inyour head pretty quicklyokay we're gonna get these numbers andmultiply them this is the biggest stepokay so this is the same as sort of like3 times 34 with an extra 0 on top sowe're gonna be going 30 times our 30which is 904 times 30 which is 120 so1020 okay so we multiply this out we get1020 and the very last thing we do is wejust add the square of this number thisnumber stiffer another 2 our answer so 2squared is 4 we're gonna add thistogether and if we do we get our answerhere 1,024 okay so I'll just go throughthose steps again we find the distancebetweenthis number and the nearest tens numberthat I'm being squared which is 2 wetake this number away from the numberbeing square we add it to the numberbeing squared so 30 times 34 and then weadd this number squared to our resultokay it's not too bad okay give it a fewguys and you'll get really really quickat doing this obviously some are gonnabe a little bit harder than others butit works for all numbers that are twodigits so what about I'd give a fewexamples here oh oh just a little bituh-ohgo a little bit harder now what about wedo 33squared so what about you pause this andwork through this or you work throughthis with me and then you'll pause a fewlater onceso the first what step we're going to dois the distance between this and thenearest tens number and there's tensnumbers 30 so the difference is three wetake it away we add it to okay so wetake this away from 33 we get 30 we addthis to 33 and we get the answer of 36next step here we multiply these so 30times 36 this is pretty much the same as900 plus 180 so 1080 okay 30 times 39006 times 30 is 18 so we're gonna add thaton which is 180 okay the last step is weadd this number squared to it so threethrees and going so what's the answer1089 hey not too bad right this isobviously the hardest step just here sothat's something you have to get used tolook I do have a video where I look athow to multiply these out fairly quicklythese answers so what about I do a bitof a harder one will do 77 squared okaywhatever put a few lines there so let'scomment that I really like it people dothat don't worry that's probably theonly time I'll do it yeahhow do we do this there so we look forthe nearest hens number ok the nearestten numbers 80 we're three away okay soif we take this are away from 77 we'vegot 74 and if we add this to 77 we have80 so let's multiply these numbers outokay if we do this seven eight 256 for 8to 32 so pretty much we're gonna get 560plus 32 so that's going to be five ninetwo with a happy little zero on the endbecause of this okay ah now why were youdo this just add three squared so threesquared is nine answer five thousandnine hundred and twenty nine you knowwhy don't you go with those hopefullyyou find that really really great littletrick I think it's a really reallyawesome little treat that one anyway letme know send a comment and a questionanything like that and I'll speak to younext time see you then bye
