evaluate 5a squared B squared minus 8a bplus 4a minus 7b minus 190 when a isequal to 5 and B is equal to negative 2so everywhere we see it f at a here weshould substitute it with a 5 andeverywhere we see of B here over here weshould substitute it with a negativewith a negative 2 so this is going to beequal toit's going to be 5 times a squared but ais now 5 we're evaluating when a isequal to 5 so it's going to be 5 times 5squared instead of a B squared we wantto put negative 2 in the place of B sonegative 2 squared and then we haveminus 8 times a but instead of an a wewant to put a 5 there so times 5 times BB is now negative 2 so times negative 2plus 4 plus 4 times a once again a is 5not in I want to do that purple color ais 5 in yellow a is 5 and then we haveminus 7 minus 7 times B B is negative 2B is negative 2 and then finally we havea minus 190 so you see every time we sawan a we just substituted the a with 5 soyou see an a here that was right overthere see an a over there that goesright over there every time we saw a B Bsquared we substituted the B withnegative 2 so B we substitute it withnegative 2 we saw a B substitute it withnegative 2 and now we just have toevaluate this expression using order ofoperations explode exponentiation wellparentheses always come first but thenexponentiation so this is going to be 5times 5 squared so let's just thinkabout this we're going to do 5 squaredfirst so 5 squared is 25 negative 2squared that is positive 4 then you havewell you don't have to do any moreexponents here so let's just multiplyeverything so we're going to haveover here five times twenty five timesfor twenty five times four is a hundredso it's going to be five times a hundredso this over here is going to simplifyto five hundred and then over here wehave negative eight times 5 timesnegative 2 negative 8 times 5 isnegative 40 negative 40 times negative 2will be positive 80 so plus 80 this isgoing to be positive cuz we have anegative times a negative so if 40 times2 which is 80 and then we have and thenwe have this term plus 4 times 5 wellthat's just going to be 20 and then wehave this term negative 7 times negative2 is positive 14 so this over here ispositive 14 and then we have to subtractthat 190 we'll just subtract 190 and sowe have let's see this over here 500plus 80 is 580 plus 20 is gets us to 600so this part is 600 up to that rightover there that is 600 you add 14 youget to 614 and then you have to subtract190 so we have 614 minus 190 we can dothis in our heads if we said we're tosubtract 200 it would give us to 414 butwe're subtracting 10 less so it would be424 let's just actually work it out 4minus 0 is 4 1 minus 9 can't do that gotto regroup or borrow we're going toborrow 1 from the 6 and so the onebecomes an 11 11 minus 9 is 2 5 minus 1is 4 so this is equal to 424
