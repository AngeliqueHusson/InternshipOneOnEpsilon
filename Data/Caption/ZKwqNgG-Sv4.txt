in January 2009 a person or group namedSatoshi Nakamoto uploaded a small pieceof free shared software to the internetcalled the Bitcoin protocol and askedothers to copy and run it on theircomputer think of this program as a freevirtual bank for the internet communityanyone is free to join and use it tosend and receive a new kind of virtualcoin to and from other account holdersit was driven by a problem people hadbeen trying to crack for 20 years how tosend cash in an electronic form over theInternet the one thing that's missingbut that will soon be developed is areliable ecash the method we're buyingon the internet you can transfer fundsfrom A to B without a knowing B or Bknowing a the way in which I can take a$20 bill and hand it over to you beforeBitcoin the only way to make electronicpayments over the internet was to callyour bank or a company connected to yourbank and ask them to move the money tothe other person however over twobillion people in the world don't evenhave access to a bank account so yousimply cannot send money to them nomatter what value they have to offerthey are shut out of the interneteconomy this is important because accessto financial services directlycorrelates to increases in dignityliberty and self-determination and eventhose who do have a bank account aren'texactly free to send money to anyoneanywhere online if two governments don'tget along money simply doesn't flowacross their borders simply put if youwanted to give $1.00 right now tosomeone via the Internet almost half ofthe world can't receive it from you adigital cash would connect humanityeconomically in a way never beforepossible in a way that included everyonein the same way that cell phonetechnology allowed entire nations toleapfrog theand line and achieve communications thatwould be unthinkable Bitcoin can do thesame for banking and finance and it canempower billions of people around theworld Bitcoin for the first time makespossible transactions online that areperson-to-person without the need for anintermediary between them just like cashSatoshi offered a physical analogy forBitcoin to warm people up to the ideaimagine there was a metal as rare asgold but it had one magical property itcan be transported over a communicationline like sending physical cash as adirect message nearly instantly butBitcoin isn't a boring gray metal it's avirtual coin taking the form of a number[Music]at first these bitcoins had no value atall they were simply passed around forfun by people who were interested in theidea like digital tickets to affairwhich didn't yet existgradually hobbyists collected and soldbitcoins for a fraction of a penny justto prove the system could work becauseonce Bitcoin had any value at all andtherefore a price it became a powerfulsocial technology this gave birth to anew layer of Internet marketplaces whichdidn't require or even allow traditionalmoney a new freedom had emerged Bitcoinwas being used by people who had nothingto do with its creation and nogovernment could stop it though Satoshiwas always worried about Bitcoin growingtoo fast from the start this was notabout making money it was about freedomof exchange online this growing publicacceptance of Bitcoin and proof that itworkedled to a secondary demand for Bitcoin asit became viewed as a safe haven for aportion of their savings which wasoutside the hands of any government sothe demand for both transactions on thenetwork an investment in the networkpushed the price of one Bitcoin rightbeside the price of an ounce of gold byDecember 2013gradually larger and larger institutionsadopted Bitcoin as a form of payment andeventually forward-thinking governmentsbegan to recognizeas a legal payment method I'm interestedin coming to learn what is needed toensure that this innovation can continueI'm here to testify because I believethat digital currency represents one ofthe most important technical andeconomic innovations of our time fouryears later in December 2017 aspeculative wave pushed the price of asingle Bitcoin past 10 ounces of goldbut before getting to the method behindhow Bitcoin works the question mostpeople get hung up on is how can anumber have value why would anyone inthe right mind trading PSA's of gold fora numberlet's rewind for a moment and thinkabout money money is how we move valueacross distance or through time within asmall trusted group such as a family youdon't really need physical money peoplegive each other things of value with thepromise to return the favor in thefuture so money actually starts as ashared memory the very oldest writtendocuments we can dig up show we oftenwrote down a list of promises to eachother known as a ledger this is what wecall digital money money which takes theform of written symbols or digits butthis kind of written money only works ifwe trust the people we are makingpromises with and so when humans travelto distant regions to trade with peoplethey've never met and may never meetagainthey used physical money instead thisallowed them to settle tradesimmediately with no trust involved andof all the kinds of physical money we'veused throughout history there is onepattern which emerges we ended up usingsome form of treasure often a rare Rocka typical rock at the beach won't worknobody values them because they are soplentiful but once in a while you willfind something more unique a shiny rocka tooth a bone humans have a tendency tocollect and treasure unique things thevalue of these treasures was based onthe fact that everyone knew they wererare rarity is the value remember if youwere alone on earth the value of anytreasure wouldn't exist any more thinkof this as symbolic value it may seemstrange to value rarity but we allexhibit this phenomenon beginning aschildren we value things that otherpeople have and we don't it can drive uscrazy it can mean everything[Music]until we find out there are many copiesof the same toy and it's no longerunique suddenly others don't value it asmuch and it becomes worthless garbageand we do this exact same thing asadults we value things based onuniqueness or rarity nothing to do withtheir actual utility throughout historyyou'll see each culture uses their ownkind of rare rock as money in theirlocal region and treasure in one regionisn't always recognized as treasure inanother gradually as people beginspreading around the world a globaltreasure emerged based on the rarest ofrocks precious metals these are theshiny bits people noticed in rocks allover the world we extracted this shinystuff by grinding up the rocks meltingthem down and pouring out only the shinystuff as pure metal and we give the nameprecious metals to only the rarest ofmetalsiron for instance is very useful almosteverything is built out of it but itisn't considered precious because thereis so much of it around that's why oneounce of iron is worth a few penniespeople only pay for its utility comparethis to one ounce of gold which is worthover a thousand dollars that's alldriven by its rarity precious metals arean important form of money because theycame to be valued everywhere on earththey work as a physical money thatcrosses all borders the value of anounce of gold is not dependent on anyone culture this explains why those inpower have always tried to hoard andcontrol gold it's a form of globalwealthand so history is full of examples ofpeople in power collecting as muchprecious metal as they could stamping itinto coins with the rulers face on itand leaking it into society via wagesacross cultures history shows thatgradually rulers realized the same thingthat the coins they pressed didn't needto be so precious what was mostimportant about a coin was not the metalcontent in it but trust in the number onit but it was the Chinese who first tookthis to its logical conclusion and putit into practice in the 11th centurywhen they created a money supply out oftrusted numbers on paper with noconnection to gold or any precious metalit's exactly like what happens at thefair today money takes the form oftickets because the Chinese realizedthat the best way to control gold was toforce everyone to sell their gold at theborders for a piece of trusted papermoney and like fair tickets you couldn'tgo back and cash those pieces of paperin for gold there was no link betweenthe paper and the gold your only optionwas to spend the paper money in theeconomy this was a brilliant scheme itallowed the rulers to hold all theglobal money such as gold while thepeople carried a local money that'scirculated within their borderseventually every country copied thisidea this results in the now modern ideaof government manufactured rare paperknown as fiat money paper money whichisn't connected or backed by gold or anyform of physical value it's printing isdecided by the government who is incharge of controlling the money supplyand enforcing its use as long as peopleremain confident that our government isstrong and securethey will continue freely to accept andspend its money without questioning thevalue that's how we end up with a worldfull of local fiat currencies whichtravel freely within the borders of agiven country dollars euros yet they areall the same thing each country is usingits own fare tickets with no connectionto gold or any precious metal and todaywe rarely use paper money roughly 90% ofyour money exists only in digital formso today you mainly use number moneylike points these points exist as yourbank account balances which are storedwith a bank in a trusted computer fileknown as a ledger of accounts weresimply a ledger the government and banksare in charge of creating securing andcensoring these numbers in the ledgerand that's digital money it's just aledger plus someone you trust such as abank to keep it up-to-date and secureand this leads us back to the problem weface online because the internet crossesall borders and acts as a new globalcommunity who is going to make thedigital tickets for the Internet and whowill we trust to be in charge of thembitcoin is the world's first completelydecentralized digital currency and it'sdecentralized part of that sentence thatis really unique the key to Bitcoin isthe way Satoshi flips the traditionalmodel of trust on its head instead ofletting a bank control a ledger youshare it with everyone anyone in theworld can plug in a computer to downloadand track the bitcoin ledger known as aBitcoin nodethis shared file model is more securethan any government or bank ledger couldhope to be consider when a highlycontroversial computer file leaks on tothe Internetthose in power learned that it wassimply impossible to stop alter ordestroy that file because there are somany independent copies of that fileBitcoin is one of a growing number ofsystems that turns this openness of theInternet into its security advantage buta bank isn't just a ledger it's also thepeople which validate and update newtransactions a bank is a process peoplefollow protocol and so you can think ofa bank ledger as a living document atany moment it contains the history ofall balla transactions which define thecurrent account balances Bitcoinautomates this banking process with apiece of shared software that allBitcoin nodes run called the Bitcoinprotocol it does the job of making surethe history of transactions is securedand so Bitcoin is a piece of sharedsoftware which everyone runs togetherinstead of having one trusted computerdo it there is no Center to the networkno central authority no concentration ofpower and no actor in whom completetrust must be vested it's exactly howants and bee colonies function which arenaturally occurring decentralizedsystems in this case a bee is like aBitcoin node they all follow the samerules but collectively this results in ahigh of being built the hive emergesfrom the bees following rules Bitcoin islike a computerized colony where insteadof building a hive they are building afile which tracks the growing history ofvalid transaction this file grows insmall chunks of new transactionsapproximately every 10 minutes onaverage known as the blockchain to bestunderstand Bitcoin you need to followhow transactions get entered into thisblockchainwith Bitcoin all transactions are publicso instead of sending a private messageto your bank to move a number from oneplace to another your computer shouts iton a public internet channel which allBitcoin nodes are listening on two keythings happen once a transaction isannounced to the network first everytransaction should be heard by everyBitcoin node in the network and secondlyevery Bitcoin node must have a chance tovote on whether a transaction was validor not to make both things happenSatoshi did something very clever knownas proof of work the system slows downthe process by which new transactionsget verified by including an extra workhurdle between when a transaction isfirst detected at a Bitcoin node andwhen it can be validated by the networkas followseach node collects approximately one totwo thousand new unverified transactionsthey hear in what's called a block nextthis block of data is passed through asymbol mixing machine which scrambles upthe data and spits out a short randomsequence of symbols associated with thatblock it acts like an ID for that blockwe call this mixing process a hashfunction and we call the random outputthe hash hash functions work in anunpredictable but repeatable way thesame block of transactions result in theexact same hash but if you change onedigit in the transaction block you getan entirely different hash and for acomputer to perform this hash operationon a block is very easy it can be donein a fraction of a second but thereverse operation is very difficultbecause hash functions are designed tomix the data in a way that makes thempractically impossible toreverse-engineerand this is the source of the extra workbecause for every block the Bitcoinsoftware specifies the form the hashmust take which is a small number thehash must be less than and is anextremely rare occurrence and withineach block an extra space is includedbefore a number the Bitcoin nodes mustfind which results in the desired hashformat to find the number which resultsin the desired hash is like finding aneedle in a haystack of numbers the bestthe Bitcoin node can do is rapidlyguessed numbers as fast as they canuntil they find one which leads to thevalid hash format for any given blockand this is what Satoshi refers to asmining it's a guessing game the firstcomputer in the network to find a luckynumber for a block is said to have minedthat block of new transactions andimmediately after mining a block thatlucky node sends it out to theirneighbors for confirmation essentiallysaying hey everybody I won this raceplease check that this block containsall valid transactions and this bringsus to the second key rule all Bitcoinnodes must follow as soon as a Bitcoinnode in the network creates or hearsabout a newly mined block from aneighboring node it stops and verifieswhether the block is valid or notif the Bitcoin node finds any problem inthe block it simply ignores it andconsiders it invalid if instead theentire block appears valid then the nodedownloads it to its memory of validtransactions but instead of simplydownloading the block it actuallyattaches to the block by calculating thehash of that block and including itwithin the next block of newtransactions they are working to minethis is how a chain is created betweenblocks which we call a blockchain itcreates an information dependencybetween all blocks if you change onesymbol in any block within a blockchainthat change will propagate forward tothe very front so it locks the historyof all transactions in place and allBitcoin notes do this same thing theyeither ignore a block if it isn't validor they attach to it if it is only afterevery node in the Bitcoin network hasattached a block to the end of itsblockchain do we consider it as a validblock this idea of voting on a block byattaching to it is subtle but verypowerful because as soon as a nodebegins mining the next block in asequenceit changes the growth rate of the chainit's connected to and so as more Bitcoinnodes work on guessing a given blockit's more likely that it will be foundsooner and so the chain will grow fasteras more nodes work on it and this leadsto the key insight behind Bitcoin thetrue blockchain is the longestblockchain because the honest chain willgrow the fastest and this allows manydisconnected people to agree on onetruth because let's say the majority ofnodes believe block a was the mostrecent valid block while only a smallminority of cheating nodes believed inBlock B and to determine which isactually the chain to trust the nodessimply monitor which chain is growingfaster and because the majority has morecollective guessing power the chainthrough block a will grow faster thanthe chain through block B it's exactlysimilar to why 10 people rolling dicewill hit on snake eyes faster than oneperson over time one person might getlucky and hit snake eyes once in a whilebut over time the majority will alwayshit snake eyes more often and this worksbecause no one computer or entity ismore powerful than the majority ofcomputers on the Bitcoin networkfor comparison if Google dedicated allits machines to mining Bitcoin it wouldmake up less than 1% of the totalNetwork power but this is all based onone important assumption that themajority of Bitcoin nodes will be honestin the first place aside from doing itout of goodwill Satoshi knew there mustbe a fair economic incentive to motivateas many people as possible toparticipate in this network to do thisthe Bitcoin protocol also rewards thefirst node to mine a block with a smallpayout of the initial Bitcoin supplyright now this payout is 12.5 bitcoinsand it's gradually decreasing towardszero such that by approximately twentyone forty all bitcoins in existence willhave been released or mind leading to aprecise supply of 21 million bitcoinswhich will ever exist so the system paysitself with the initial supply to growand secure itself so bitcoins come intoexistence through the Bitcoin miners andthen they are spread around to thegeneral public via open markets ordirectly from person to person andthat's how Bitcoin works they arenumbers that flow through a ledger thateveryone tracks together and to this daynobody has been able to compromise orattack this system even with hundreds ofbillions of dollars on the line asregulatory and law enforcement agenciesseek to apply existing laws to Bitcointhey will face the challenge thatBitcoin is not a company with an easilyidentifiable executive but instead it'san open-source project and a communitythe first wave of the Internet in the80s and early 90s resulted in a networkwhich connected humans globally in a waynever before possiblesoon after the second wave of theinternet gave birth to massive networkswith billions of connected people thatwere owned and controlled by a singletrusted corporate entity via proprietarysoftwarethe idea behind Bitcoin and some say thenext wave of the Internet is to dissolvethat border and replace the trustidentity and proprietary softwarewith an open network running free sharedsoftware which is available to everyoneand it's based on a new model where thecrowd takes control of the software weuse instead of a trusted third party thequestion left in the wake of Bitcoin iswhat's next what would your reaction beto just a rapport with onerecommendation and that recommendationwould be that there be no regulationsand that we revisit this in say fiveyears I think that would be a very goodidea I think there is some room forclarification clarifying for example thetax status for individuals or at leastclarifying the right of an individual tomake a choice in the currency they useas a consumer as entirely equivalentwith any other national currency in thenear future the Bitcoin protocol willalso facilitate advanced paymentservices and experiments are currentlyunderway to provide additionalnon-financial services like propertymanagement and identity verificationyou[Music]
