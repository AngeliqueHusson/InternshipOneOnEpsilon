a party goods companies making noveltycrowns out of paper they start with arectangular piece of paper and then cutthree semi circles each with a six inchdiameterout of the top to create a crown so theystart with a rectangle and then they cutthese semi circles out of the top ofthat rectangle find the area andperimeter of the crown below so let'sjust start with the perimeter of it sowe have to find the lengths of each ofthese semicircle arcs right over hereand then add those and then add them tothese lengths over here which is withthat latter part is prettystraightforward but let's just thinkabout how long how long this is rightover here then I'm highlighting in blueand we know that this is a semicircle itis half of a full circle that hasdiameter six and if we wanted to knowthe circumference of the entire circlethe in circumference of this entirecircle is given by and this really comesstraight out of the definition of piit's pi times the diameter or anotherway to think about the diameters tworadiuses so it's two pi times the radiusbut they give us the diameter right overhere the diameter is six inches thediameter is six inches so thecircumference this entire circumferenceright over here is going to be equal tothe circumference is equal to six pithat's the circumference of the entirecircle if we think about there's thecircumference of one of the semi circlesso circumference of or maybe I shouldsay the length of a semicircle is goingto be half of this it's half the circleso this length right over here is goingto be 3 pi and then this one is theexact same length is going to be 3 piagain half of the circumference of theentire circle and then this over here isgoing to be 3 pi again and now we'reready to figure out the perimeter youhave 3 3 3 pies so it's going to be 3times 3 pi plus 6 inches plus 6 plus 18plus 6 again plus 6 again so this is 9pi that's this part right over there 9pi plus so this is going to be 12 plus18 plus 30that's the perimeter and if we wanted toif we wanted tolet me write this to this is equal tothe perimeter and if we wanted to getthe exact number you could substitute3.14 for a rough approximation of pi orwe could get our calculator out and getthe exact or pretty close to the exactnumber even a calculator doesn't have aninfinite precision for pi but let'slet's get the calculator out and if wewant to get nine pi nine times pi plusthirtythat gets us fifty six fifty eight pointand I'll just round to the hundredsfifty-eight point two seven inches fiftyeight point two seven inches so it'sequal to fifty eight point two seven andinches because all of these units werein inches fifty two point fifty eightpoint two seven inches that's ourperimeter now let's think about the areato figure out the area what we can do iswe could figure out the area of therectangle before they cut out thesecircles so the area of the entirerectangle and then we can subtract fromthat the area of these semicircles sothe area of the rectangle the area ofthe rectangle is just the base times theheight it's equal to 18 times six incheslet me write the unit's down 18 inchestimes six inches and this is equal toten times six is 68 times 6 is 48 so itbecomes 108 inches squared inches inchessquared 108 square inches that's thearea of the entire rectangle we're notdone yet because we haven't cut out thesemicircles the area if these werecomplete circles if you think about itas complete circles the area of acomplete circle is PI R squared so areaof a circle is going to be pi times theradius squared the diameter here is 6the radius here is going to be 3 so theradius is going to be 3 inches so it'spi times 3 inches squared which is equalto 9 pi square inches that's for each ofthese complete circles so it's 9 pi foreach of the complete ones if you takehalf of themI'll write it over here area of thesemicircle is going to be 9 PI over 2inches or squared inches and we havethree of them we have three of these ofthese semi circles so the area of thiscrown I'll do it this in pink the areaof the crown is going to be equal to thearea of the rectangle which is 108square inches minus 3 times the area ofthe semicircle is minus this minus thisminus this minus 3 of the semicirclesminus 3 times 9 PI over 2 inches squaredand this is equal to 108 - what is thisminus 27 over 2 PI inches squared andyou could leave it that way if you justwanted to leave it in terms of pi but aswe know pi is a number and we can useour calculator to evaluate it we getcalculator out we have 108 minus 27 I'lljust write is 27 PI over 2 27 PI dividedby 2 all right 108 minus 27 PI dividedby 2 will give us it will give us 65 andif I round to the hundred sixty fivepoint five nine inches square inches tobe exact or to be get the right units 65point sixty five point five nine squareinches so this is equal to 65 point fivenine inches squared and we are done
