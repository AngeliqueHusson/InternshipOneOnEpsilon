until now we have worked only withpositive exponents here's a very simpleexample to understand negative exponentsconsider this number three raise tominus four since we are familiar withpositive exponents let's understand howwe can write this negative exponent as apositive exponent we multiply and dividethe number by 3 raise to 4 multiplied by3 raise to 4 and divided by 3 raised to4 in short we are multiplying the numberby 1 which will keep the original numberunchanged that equals 3 raised to minus4 multiplied by 3 raised to 4 divided by3 raised to 4 we multiplied this withthis and divided by this focus on thenumerator now since the base is the samewe can use the product law to write itdown as 3 raised to minus 4 plus 4 andwe write the denominator as is minus 4plus 4 equals 0 hence that would equal 3raised to 0 divided by 3 raised to 4 andsince we know that any nonzero numberraised to 0 equals 1 we can write itdown as 1 divided by 3 raised to 4 letme repeat this is a very importantproperty any nonzero number raised to 0equals 1 this was our original number 3raised to minus 4 and we got the answeras 1 divided by 3 raised to 4 so all wedid is change the sign of the exponentI wrote it under 1 so we can generalizeit as a raise to minus M equals 1divided by a raise to M where a is notequal to 0 because if a is equal to 0then we would have 0 in the denominatorwhich would make it in determinatethis term is read as a raise to negativepower Mthere's a very simple trick we need tounderstand here consider three raise tominus four when we have to write it downas a positive exponent it equals 1divided by 3 raise to 4 so all we didhere is change the sign of the exponentand wrote it under 1 now consider 21 by37 the whole raised to minus 7 to writeit down as a positive exponent we writeit down as 1 divided by 21 by 37 thewhole raise to 7 again we just changedthe sign of the exponentI wrote it under 1 the same trick can beused for positive exponents to nowconsider 4 raised to 3 we can write itdown as 1 divided by 4 raised to minus 3we change the sign of the exponentI wrote it under 1you
