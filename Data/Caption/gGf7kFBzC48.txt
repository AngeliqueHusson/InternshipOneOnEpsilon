hey everyone Anthony here from mashupmath thank you again for stopping by onthis lesson where I'm going to teach youhow to graph a quadratic functionwithout using a graphing calculatorwelcome back again everyone let's juststart off with a question as usualwhat's the deal with quadratics nowbefore we answer that question let'slook at something that we already knowand that is graphing a linear equationor an equation in y equals MX plus Bform now if we call it a linear functioninstead of y equals we would have f of Xequals and it's super important that youunderstand that f of x and y mean thesame thing okay they both represent theoutput now if I wanted to graph a linearfunction and fill out the table let'slook at f of X equals 2x plus 1 I willstart at the y-intercept of positive oneand put a point and the coordinates ofthat point are 0 1 and then I can usethat slope of positive 2 or positive 2over 1 and use rise over run going up 2over 1to find more points I could go up 2 over1 to find the point 1 3 repeating thatslope would get me 2.25 and I cancommute at one more time to get thepoint 3 7 now I can also go in theopposite direction below the y-interceptto find more points and then I canconnect these points by constructing myline and that was pretty easy so for alinear function our starting point isthat y-intercept and we use the slope tobuild the line fill on the table andconstruct the graph so now we want toextend our understanding of graphinglinear functions and develop a strategyfor graphing quadratic functions whichare of the form ax squared plus BX plusC so for example let's replace a B and Cthose coefficients with 1four and five and also notice that a isone so we're just gonna drop it we'renot going to include it so our actualfunction here is f of X equals x squaredminus four X plus five that's what wewant to graph and we should also befamiliar with the fact that a quadraticfunction has this curve this u-shapedgraph called a parabola now with alinear function the y-intercept was thereally important point that we couldbuild off of but with a quadraticfunction that important point is thatvertex that turning point and if we canfind that point we can graph theparabola now for quick reference hereyou could take that function and put itinto y equals on your graphingcalculator and then the calculator woulddo all the thinking for youit would fill on the table of values andall that you would have to do with thattable of values is plot the pointstarting with the vertex in this case at2 1 and then again provided that youhave that table of values you can goahead and plot the rest of the pointsaround the vertex which will allow youto graph the parabolaso we can say that if we know the vertexthen we can build the parabola and graphthe quadratic function so now let's takethis a step further and explore how wecan grab them by dragging without usinga calculator so let's go ahead andrevisit the last example of f of xequals x squared minus 4x plus 5 that'sthe function that we want to graph inorder to do that we need a table ofvalues so first thing we want to do isfind the vertex of this function so howdo we find it there is a formula whichyou may or may not be familiar with xequals negative B over 2a and this isthe formula for finding the axis ofsymmetry of a parabola so let's explorewhat this meansfirst let's replace B in the formulawith the B term from the quadratic ofnegative 4 and then negative negative 4is just positive 4 and then down in thedenominator 2 times a we know that the aterm is 1 so I replace a with 1 and 2times 1 is just 2 finally we have 4 over2 or 4 divided by 2 which is just 2 soour axis of symmetry is at x equals 2now we know that an x equals equation isa vertical line equation in this case atpositive 2 now what an axis of symmetryis okay that is the line that goesthrough the vertex of the parabola nowwe don't know where that parabola is onthe Y but we do know where it is on theX and that is at positive 2 so we havethe x coordinate of our vertex now allwe need to do is find the y coordinateand that is still unknown however we doknow that X is 2 we just figured thatout and y equals the original quadraticso I'm going to replace X with 2 andthen evaluate so 1 times 2 squared is 4minus 4 times 2 is negative 8 and then Ijust bring down that positive 5 and a 4minus 8 plus 5 evaluates to just 1 sothe y coordinate when x is 2 is positive1 and now we have the coreit's of our vertex at 2-1 and we can goahead and plot that point so to quicklyrecap what we just didwe found the vertex of this parabola byfirst using the axis of symmetry formulax equals negative B over 2a to find thex value of the vertex then we plug thatx value into the original function toget the output which was the y-value ofthe vertex and then we had our fullpoint so now we know that our parabolahas a vertex at 2/1 and we should have abetter idea of what our final graph isgoing to look like but we still need tofind the rest of the points now for theX values I'm just going to build aboveand below the vertex value so now forinstance if I want to find the Y valuewhen X is 3 I will replace X in theoriginal function with 3 and then justevaluate so in this case I would add 9minus 12 plus 5 which evaluates topositive 2 so when X is 3 y is positive2 and now I have another point on theparabola so I'm going to go ahead andplot the point 3 2let's go ahead and find in another pointlet's say I want to find the Y valuewhen X is zero I'll replace X with 0 inthe original function and then evaluateand I should just get positive 5 so 0positive 5 is another point that is on aparabolanow I can easily repeat this process forthe remaining x-values to find the restof the points that are on the graph nowonce I do this I have a filled in tableof values and all I have to do is plotthose remaining points and we havecompleted our graph oh cool okay solet's try one more example here we wantto graph the quadratic f of X equals xsquared minus 2x minus 6 without using acalculator now remember that the firstthing we want to find is the vertex ofthe parabola and then we can build fromthere now again we want to use that axisof symmetry formula x equals negative Bover 2a and we're going to fill and thenevaluate or place B with negative 2negative negative 2 is just positive 2and then in the denominator we replace awith the a value in this case just 1 and2 times 1 is just 2 finally 2 over 2 or2 divided by 2 is just equal to 1 andnow we have the x-coordinate for ourvertex at positive 1 so now we're goingto use that value of positive 1 to plugin and find the value of y now rememberthat f of X equals and y equals mean thesame thing so I rewrite the function iny equals form and then I replace the X'swith 1 and now I can evaluate 1 squaredis just 1 negative 2 times 1 is justnegative 2 and then I just bring downthat negative 6 and then 1 minus 2 minus6 is equal to negative 7 and that is thevalue of our y coordinate of our vertexso we found the vertex and it is at 1negative 7 so I can go ahead and plotthat point next I can go ahead and fillin the X values on my table of values bygoing above and below the x value of thevertex and now I'm ready to find therest of the points on the parabola so ifX is negative 2r replace it in theoriginal function with negative 2 andthen evaluate in this case I would have4 plus 4 minus 6which evaluates to positive - so when Xis negative 2 y is positive 2 and I haveanother point negative 2 - that is onthe graph and now all you have to do isrepeat this process for the remaining Xvalues by substituting it in andwhatever your output is that will beyour Y value now once you have theseremaining points and you have completedyour table of values you can plot themon the graph and construct your parabolaand that is how you graph a quadraticfunction without using a calculatorquick recap whenever you want to graph aquadratic function without the use ofthe calculator you start by finding thevertex point using the x equals negativeB over 2a formula once you find X youplug it into the original function toget your value of Y then you find therest of the points by plugging the Xvalues into the original function thenplotting your points in the table ofvalues and constructing your graphthat's all there is to it so practicethis think about what you're doing soyou
