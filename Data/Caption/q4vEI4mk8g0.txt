so in this video I want to go overdividing fractions and it turns out thatif you know how to multiply fractionsyou actually know how to dividefractions as well that's becausedividing fractions is exactly the sameas multiplying by the reciprocal and ifyou don't know what that meansmultiplying by the reciprocal is thesame thing as flipping the secondfraction and then multiplying so let'sjust get started right away with thisexample here we have 3/5 divided by 2over 3 so once again dividing fractionsis exactly the same as multiplying bythe reciprocal the reciprocal of 2 over3 is 3 over 2once again I just flipped the numeratorand the denominator and now thesefractions can be multiplied quite easilyfirst I'm going to multiply thenumerators 3 times 3 gives us a 9 andthen in the denominator we have 5 times2 which is just 10 so let's just go overa couple more examples I'm going towrite this example in a little differentformat let's say we have 1/2 all dividedby negative 1/3 so this is exactly thesame as 1/2 divided by negative 1/3 andonce again dividing is exactly the sameas multiplying by the reciprocal so I'mgoing to take the 1/2 and I'm going tomultiply it by the reciprocal ofnegative 1 over 3 which is just negative3 over 1 now I'm going to multiply thesetwo fractions together I'm going tomultiply the two numerators 1 timesnegative 3 is just negative 3 and 2times 1 is just 2 so here are some morevideos with some more example problemsrelated to the video you just watchedI really hope you're finding mytutorials helpful so until my next videoI will see you lateryou
