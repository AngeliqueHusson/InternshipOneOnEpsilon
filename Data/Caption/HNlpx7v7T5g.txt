hi my name is Philip Brown I'm thebearded masked man and this week'sepisode of Wednesday's why I'd like toexplain to you buying anything to thepower 0 is 1 first get started let'sjust start with a random number like 2to the power of 5 we could pick any baselike 712 to the power of I don't know 42but 712 hard to write and 42 that's alot of so it's to the power fist likethatnow that's five twos all multiplying outlet's go ahead and divide that by justtwo which would of course be to thepower of one if you read all that outand you reduce you'll end up with two tothe power of four and from this we cankind of see how a shortcut works it'sgoing to be the numerators exponentminus the denominators exponent and thatwould be 5 minus 1 that's 2 to the power4 okay now let's apply this to somethingthat's going to shed light on whyanything but the power of 0 is 1 let'slook at 2 to the fifth again but let'sdivide that by 2 to the fifth write allthat out you get to the fifth is fivetwos and another five twos and well thatusing our shortcut that would be 2 tothe fifth minus 5 would be 2 to thepower of 0 and as we can see 5 2 dividedby 5 2 s is just equal to 2/1 so we'redoneI hope this video is helpful and maybeeven interesting so if it was you couldhelp me out it quick like maybesubscribe share it with other peopleanyway thanks for watching[Music]
