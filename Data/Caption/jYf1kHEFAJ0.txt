hello welcome to the section ofmastering statistics in the last sectionwe introduced the concept of thevariance the sample variance wouldcalculate when you have a collection ofsamples there and the populationvariance which is what you wouldcalculate if you knew every single valuein the population which is a largecollection usually most of the time youcan't calculate the population variancebecause the population is too big butthere is an equation there if you needit so in this case what we're going todo in this lesson is practice that justgive you an idea so if I wanted tocalculate the sample variance so I'd sayfind the sample variance of thefollowing things then how would we dothat let me look and and change colors alittle bit and say our data set is fiveeight seven six and nine all right andso what we want to do is find that wewant to find that sample variance sobecause it's a sample variance this is avery small set of samples then what youuse is the S squared equation it's thesum of all of these little deviationsabout the mean but we square each oneright before you do any summing and thenwe divide by n minus 1 in this case inthe number of samples is 5 so on thebottom we'll have 5 minus 1 now beforewe can do anything we know we're goingto need to find the mean because everydata point is subtracting the mean fromit so what we'll do is just kind of gooff to the side and do that right nowthe mean is for a sample mean we alreadyto have done this before 5 plus 8 plus 7plus 6 plus 9 and there are 1 2 3 4 5values so we divided by 5 and what we'llget and we add up the top is 35 over 5which is 7 so the mean is actually 7 allright so then it becomes a matter ofjust substituting in and making sure youdon't make any mistakes my advice whenyou're calculating the variance sincethere's a lot of numbers is don't skipany steps write everything down taketime to simplify it and simplify itdon't try to do too many things andadvanced because you're probably gonnamake an error so the way I write it islike this I'll open up a parenthesis andI'll say okay the first point notice theway the equations written written it'sthe data point minus the mean the firstdata point is five minus the mean themean is going to always be seven so I'llwrite it as 5 minus seven and then Ihave to square it because that's whatwe're doing here the next point is eightso I'll open up another parenthesis andsay 8 minus 7 because in all cases I'msubtracting the same mean I got a squarethat guy and then the third data pointis 7 minus the mean which is 7 andthat's going to be squared and then thenext one is going to be 6 minus 7because that's that data point rightthere and then the final one is 9 so itwould be 9 minus 7 and I'll square thatone off at the end so I have kind of onthe numerator here I'm adding up fivethings each little nugget herecorresponds to a point this is the datapoint minus the mean this is the datapoint minus the mean this is data pointminus two mean you do that for all ofthe data points after the subtractionyou square it and that's why thesquaring is on the outside of theparenthesis now notice I know that allof you know that seven minus seven iszero I know that all of you know thateight minus seven is one I know that allof you know that you can figure out whatall of these points are but notice Ididn't do that addition or subtractionin my head I write it all down becausewhen you have a large number of datapoints you're probably gonna make anerror at some point just because you gettired or whatever and as a teacher youneed to be able to see that the studentknows what they're doing so by writingit all out I can see exactly what youmeant to do even if you make a mistakeso on the bottom is going to be n minusone and as the number of data
