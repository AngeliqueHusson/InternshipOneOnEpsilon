g'day and welcome to tech bath channelwhat we're going to be having looking atthis video is a third video just lookingat trigonometry okay it's really reallysimple sort of stuck trigonometry onceyou get the hang of it now the firstvideo we were just looking about how togo through and label sides and thingslike this and all the differenttrigonometry you might use and in thelast video we looked at how to workingout and I know one side on a right angletriangle using trigonometry this videowe're gonna be having a look at thoughhere unknown angles okay it's prettysimple sort of stuff though and you justneed to follow a few basic rules sofirst off what you have to be able to dois realize it with a right angletriangle we have this longer side whichis called the hypotenuse and also wehave to be able to label these othersides according to this angle here withthe angle you may be trying to work outor the angle which we are given which wecall theta the one opposite theta iscalled the opposite and the one adjacentis called the adjacent so the first stepyou want to be able to do is label thesewe look at this in the first video wealso used it in the last video you alsowant to remember the differenttrigonometry and so this is thescientific calculator in the computercalculator you will need a scientificcalculator to do this you'll see that wehave sine cos 10 ross'll years in thisinverse function in this particular partokayyou also might see this casuallyriverside -1 and that sort of deal sothe functions we have to know was signequals opposite over hypotenuse cosequals adjacent over hypotenuse and 10equals opposite over adjacent rememberedwith that lovely pneumonic some old hagscan't always hack their own a so you canremember this you're doing pretty wellbecause we just follow these particularsteps when we solve these trigonometryfirst we label the sides we work out thetrigonometry thats at first two thingswe need thatthen we're going to substitute in valuesI'm an asshole but it's fairly simple solet me give you an example here so youget this sort of question we have thisparticular question we have this rightangle and we have this particular shapee'er in fact I might elongated a littlebit um let's make it a little bit alittle bit longer okay so say we hadthis and what I want to do is I'm goingto give it some lengths okay I'm gonnagive it a length here which will be whatabout we call this 17 and I'm going togive this one over here eight and what Ireally really want to know more thananything in the worldis I want to know what this angle E iswhat theta is we can use trigonometry towork this out okay and this is reallybasic stuff too you'll get this reallyreally quicklyso first off you have to label the sidesso what sides are we dealing with we'redealing with the opposite and we'redealing with the adjacent okayI'm no longer than I put into this is ahypotenuse we're not using it more Ilabel it so we're dealing with theopposite and the adjacent so you mightremember that so we've done that we'velabeled the sides now we can work in ourtrigonometryold hags can't always hack their old ageso we're dealing with that where we'redealing with the oh and the I 1 which is10 okay let's get rid of these oneswe're not dealing with so we're dealingwith Ted yeahokay so tantheta then theta is what we're trying towork out equals the opposite over theadjacent equals the opposite which is 8over the adjacent which is 17 so we wereto work out this on the calculator we gowe put this up here and what I do is Igo I know it's going to be sitting smackbang in the middle of nowhere good allthe time but I divided by 17 this equalsour 4.0.4 705 I'm just going to writethis down you idiot in the stage youdon't need to equals 0.47 okay tan thetaequals this now the way that we work outtheta is that we gotheta equals this amount but we don'thit we hit tan but we're going to hitthis as a negative 1 tan the inverse oftan so we've got this number here and wedo this we go inverse tan and we get 25point 2 that is our answer it's a 25point two degree angle did you get thatso instead of this time just hitting tanwe actually have to hit the inverse inhere okay or on some scientificcalculators laughs like a secondfunction button and it will go to thisthing you'll see written above it willhave this minus one up here or somethinglike this that's all you have to do forthese guys so let's give it anotherexample here what about we do adifferent one again like I said in thelast video I'm not going to try I'd likeso I lied in the last video I did diddeliberately make it particular functiondidn't I but this one I'm going to seewhich one it ever comes out okay I'm notgoing to I'm just going to try and dorelatively quickly but not a simile andwe will use the hypotenuse oh well itlet's let's call this one X and I'mgoing to do this one here which is I'mgoing to call 15 and we're going to dothe feet here we don't know that is okayso first off let's label the sides okaywe're not using the opposite we're usingthe adjacent and the hypotenuse so welabel the sides we'll get thetrigonometric function okay so is itsome old hags can't always hack that'sactually this one isn't that you can seethat already don't even need to finishtheir old age park so it's cos cosineequals adjacent over hypotenuse so carstheta equals adjacent over hypotenusecan't always have equalswhat am i doing corn that X by the waywe know we know this side here ah man Iwas real lucky sometimes I'll put thisside back in and then really good I thengo making it the wrong color yeah goodgood real winner of a video this onehere no way matter will it okay thisside we do know what I was saying herewe do know this I was going to give itsome random value let's call it seventeen okay I can't be a smaller than bagthat kind of wouldn't work with it solet's call it 17 say 15 over 17 okayDeion Jason over the hypotenuse and sowhat do we get we're going to havebeaten yet equally fifteen overseventeen and this should be equal tothe cosine but it's the negative one oneokay so we can hit this all in one fellswoop here okay let's do this we go15/17 equalsinverse cosine it's 28 degrees arrayokay this equals 28 degrees cool yeahand you I make mistakes this is tellingme it's wrong making mistakes wantingour questions man I should script us abit betterone last layer mask oh okay I'll try tomake an assign one now that's in a lotof fun so this is what we have here okaywe have we want to know theta we havethe office we have the opposite which isfive we know the hypotenuse which iseight let's solve this now I told youit's the same oneokay let's label it first on we have theopposite we have that hypotenuse someold hags see sine theta equals opposite5 over 8okay so theta equals 5 over 8 sine tothe negative 1 let's work this out 5divided by 8 equals sineOh Row 1 5 divided by 8 equals inversesine equals 38.7 degrees equals 38.7degrees pretty easy right anywayhopefully that was a some help I knowthat last one was a bit of a rush I tellyou a bit of a hint I can actually hearmy children coming in the house rightnow I'm about to ruin my video make lotsand lots of noise so I did rush throughthat last one anyway hopefully thatwasn't too rushed for you though thatlast part thanks for watching this anyquestions any difficulties any mistakesthat I made hook but sure that wouldnever happen let me know anyways see younext time bye
