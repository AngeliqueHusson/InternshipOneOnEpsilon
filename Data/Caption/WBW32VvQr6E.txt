welcome let me briefly talk about a veryfamous problem mathematics called thebasal problem uh she first posed in 1644by Italian mathematician Bengali and heasked what is the sum of the reciprocalsof all the sequela numbers now he hadenough mathematics under spelt to beable to say this was actually a finalanswer but you know what the numberactually was um in later decades nowthis became known as a particularexample of a function with datafunctionsyou know the Zeta 2 which in general isa decays and some of the reciprocaldecay the powers so basic min gali wasasking what's the value of theta 2 wellit took some 90 years but Euler actuallymanaged to find a way to actuallycompute this particular sum he did in away that's actually completely inspiredcompletely brilliant but you know mathwould should stay with questionerstechniques and they have actually goneback and proved that everything isacclaimed can be justified in greattechnical detail so we you know we noneed to take away from all thisbrilliance here let me just go throughwhat order did and I'll avoid thetechnical details myself but just showyou his brilliance in hand all rightlet's go from a slightly circa touristroute let me ask you different questionssuppose I asked for polynomial for meand I would at this point I would haveour two properties that at 0 it hasvalue 1 and that this value this polymeractually equals 0 at x equals a b c andd we have no trouble constructingexamples such a beast what you probablydo is do the obvious thing get the zerosfirst X minus a X minus B X minus C Xminus T great advantages of those fourpoints unfortunately every when I put xequals zero in this formula I get onebut we can rectify that by dividing byall the numerator that would resultthere is an example problem ever doesthe trick now let me just simplify thisabove rearranged little bit X minus adivided by a I could be up this is an Xminus one x over B minus one x over Cminus one X minus D over one and whatI'm going to do is I'm just going torearrange this one little step furtherjust multiply everything through bynegative one because we're going to evennumber terms are not correct the onlyreason I'm doing this here is that itmakes it very clear that the leadingcoefficient is one if I were to expandthis product out the cost term would bechoosing the constant each set ofparentheses will be one so I've actuallyasked for five zeros I could follow thislatter formula here and we'll do thetrick for me have a constant term of oneand a clue have zeros of a x equals axwould be C XDM x equals e alright sothere we go there's a general techniquefor finding what a polynomial must bewhich has X P of 0 is 1 and specifiedzeros so what is going to take that andapply that technique to all sorts ofpolynomials including ones of infinitedegree that is infinite seriesthat's the questionable part but youknow blithely going along let's do itand what particular polynomial or what Ithought to do work with was the sine ofX whoops where's my pen we know as aninfant agree upon analysis X mustexecute on three factorial plus X to thefive on five factorial and so on rightgrand its nose we know it's zeros sineof X is zero at zero plus a minus PIplus a minus 2 pi plus a minus threepipe at the only trouble with thisparticular polynomial but I put in xequals zero it doesn't equal one so whatall is thought to do is its divide bothsides by X and book with this polynomialsaid one minus x squared on threefactorial plus X to the fourth on fivefactorial and so onnow that polynomial clearly if I put xequals one into at least the right handside at x equals zero into the righthand side out pops the value one andthis guy has 0 as well I removed the 0 xequals 0 as a zero it has these guys aszeroswell by the book we just did this mustbe the polynomial the form 1 minus xover PI 1 minus x over negative PI minusx over 2 pi just go through all thezeros and turn one last x over negative2 pi dot a dot and so on forever thesefirst two terms I really 1 minus x overpi times 1 plus X of a PI so bydifference of two squares is 1 minus xsquared on PI squared the next two termsare going to the same trick 1 minus xsquared on 4 PI squared next to turn ourisn't right down but they've been at 1minus X minus 9 pi squared and so on sothere we have itsine x over X must be this infiniteproductHeung Boks this whole thing in what allit said since I'm willing to believethis out pops the solution to the puzzleproblem cuz look let's actually expandthat infinite product we just created onthe right I'm just gonna leave all thisjunky stuff I don't need it right nowokay so if I expand the right hand sideI'll do it in green pen expand this theconstant n will be choosing 1 1 1 1 andevery terms that Stephanie is one andthen they'll be stuck with X Squared'sand I'll work with minus X Squared'sbecause to get an x squared term I newto choose an x squared term and one setof parentheses and one they're afterso hardly drew that by choosing thefirst of them it's parentheses whichshowcase have been factored minus 1 overPI squared it's a 1 of a PI squared or Icould choose the x squared term in thesecond parentheses and one everywhereelse it gives me plus a 1 over 4 PIsquared because my size take you upthere or I could choose an x squaredhere those negative x square that theseare 9 pi squared 1 over 9 PI squared andso on to actually expand out the producton the right here I know it must haveextra squared term with this coefficientand I can keep going if I wish but lookI know what this coefficient of xsquared must be it's right here look atit it must be negative 1 over 6 so thisterm here must be 1/6 well I've got a PIsquared in the way but if I multiplyboth sides by PI squared if it's 1 plus1 over 4 plus 1 over 9 plus 1 over 16and so on must be PI squared over 6that's the value of Zeta 2 very veryclever actually this formula we have sofar just can't be taken a little bitfurtherum john wallis actually came with a veryinteresting formula for pi and they usedan infinite continued fraction if Irecall correctly but actually we got itright here as well let's take thisformula sine x over x equals thisinfinite product and choose a veryspecific value for X let's work with xequals PI over 2 well sine of 90 degreesis 1 so the left-hand side is 1 over PIover 2 so I'm going to have 2 over piequals this infinite productwell it's gonna be one - put x equals PIover 2 pi squared cancel 1 over 4 times1 minus PI squared over 2 PI over 2squared PI squares cancel 1 minus 1 on 4times 4 1 minus 1 4 times 9 and so onthey was still swift there how what arethese fractions 1 minus 1/4 is 3/4 1minus 16th is 15 16 1 minus 2 36 is 3536 and so on so actually 2 over pi isgiven by this product and what how willus actually express this by inverting itand saying instead PI over 2 is 4 2 2over 3 1 times 3 times 16 4 times 4 over15 3 times 5 times 36 6 times 6 over 355 times 7 and so onthere's Wallace's formula very veryclever indeed all right well weak weightis the coefficient of x squared in thisproduct and what if there's someinteresting former that can come out ofit creating the coefficient of x to thefourth do the expected patients toexpand this out in terms the fourthpowerswell what's hidden there wonderfullittle mystery Thanks
