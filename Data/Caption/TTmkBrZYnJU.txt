g'day welcome to tech bat-channel whatwe're going to be having a look at inthis video is angles in a triangle okaynice simple sort of video we're justgoing to look at first off theproperties of triangles in terms ofangles and how to work out unknownangles associated with trianglesokay so let's launch straight into thisso first off no matter which triangle welook at I'll draw one up right now so nomatter which triangle we look at alltriangles have the following propertyand that is that their angles add up to180 degrees what this means is that thisangle Plus this angle Plus this angleall add up to 180 degrees okay so thisis really handy if we wanted to work outfirst off the first type of questionyou'll get with our triangles which isthis so say we have a couple of know oneside so this one 73 degrees and this onehere is 42 degrees and you were asked towork out the unknown side well this isreally simple because we know all theseangles will add up to 180 degrees and sotherefore what we need to do is we justneed to work out what number we need toput here to add all these opens up 180degrees okay so we get 180 we take off73 we take on 42 what we have left willbe the size of the angle so 72 and 43 isgoing to be 115 so we get 180 take on 15we are left with an angle of 65 degreesbecause 65 and 115 add up to 180 degreesso X here is 65 degrees so this is areally really handy thing for workingout triangles straight away we're onlythree minutes in we've already worked atthat first thing the Dexy I'll show youwith triangles is this okay so say wehave a different type of triangle andthis time what we have is we have one ofthese type of triangles which is I'llshow you it's not going to be a perfectdrawing here we have this type oftriangle where this angle here is 70degrees and we know that these two sidelengths are the same and we wish to knowthis angle we wish to know I label thisangle is slightly different we wish toknow angle B I see we wish to know thisangle hereokay so how did we work this out nowbecause this triangle here is what'sknown as an isosceles triangle that isit has two equal sides as the donut herewe can also say that this angle downhere is also 70 degrees this angle ofthis angle will be equal so now we canuse this idea of a hundred eightydegrees being the total of the anglesand we take off this angle of this anglewe take them off so 70 and 70 is 140we'll take that away we are left with 40degrees so this angle here is 40 degreesvery good okay let's have a look atanother thing with triangles okay andthis is now getting into exterior angleswith triangles interior and exteriorangles so I'll draw this triangle herehere we go one two three sides and I'lljust label just a couple of angles inthis down first off just a couple ofthings what we do is these inside anglesthese angles inside the triangle we callinterior angles I'm going to label thema B and C so a B and C here are what weterm interior angles they are inside thetriangles at a B and C now what we cando is we can extend the line of one ofthe sides of the triangle to create anexterior angle okay I'll show them in soI'm going to extend the line BC here Ican extend it's going along along alongalong along and I extended outwards thiswayand you'll notice that I've formed thisparticular angle here what I do that I'mgoing to call this angle D and this isan exterior angle it's outside thetriangle an exterior angle that's angleD now there's a couple of propertieshere that are really handy when we wantto work out unknown angles of thisparticular triangle we get shapes onthis to work out and that is this andfirst off is this the exterior angle andit's D here and the interior angle nextto it add up to 180 degrees set angle Dhere and the angle next with theinterior angle C add up to 180 degreesnothing surprising because this alonghere is aligned and the straight lineangle is 180 degrees but I'll just writethat down so angle C here plus angle Dequals 180 degrees okay and there'sanother property here that is also handywhich is this so that's one of thesecond property which is really handyfor working out unknown sizes is that'sthe sum of the two interior oppositeangles from the exterior angle that isangle B and a here the sum of them so weadd them together they add up to thesame as the exterior angle over hereokay so angle A plus angle B the twoopposite interior angles add up to theexterior angle so they add up to angle Dhere okay so this is really handy forworking out a couple of types ofquestions that you can get when you areworking with angles of triangles andI'll give you an example of this so sayget rid of all this so say I was to havethe following example say I would drawup something very quickly and we'll workout the unknown sides so say I had thisparticular shape here and I have a fewangle sides that we know we have thisone which is 120 degreeswe have this one which is 82 we havethis one down here which are color greenwhich is X and we have this one whichI'll color up here a different colorwhich is why okay that's not very clearI'll just do that again call that Y andso now you want to work out theseunknown side so we can use this idea todo this and I'll show you how okay youmight be other go right ahead of me andwork it out so the first thing I'm goingto work out the easiest one is angle Xhere okay so angle X is equal to wellangle X plus 120 degrees is going toequal 180 degrees because this exteriorangle plus the angle closest to wouldadd up to 180 degrees so we have to lookat we think well if we get 180 degreeswhich is what they add up to we take offis 120 degrees of the exterior anglewe're left with angle X here so this is60 degrees so that's the first onereally really simple right I'll just rubour that part out there and I'll justput 60 degrees here just to help us downso now we want to work out what Y ishere so Y degrees we're working on thatis well this is fairly simple because wehave we know that all the angles herehave to add up to 180 degrees okay thisand this and this and all these interiorangles add up to 180 degreesso I'm going to get 180 degrees and I'mgoing to take away the sum of 82 and 60so 182 and 60 equal 142 so I'm going totake that away 142 degrees and I'm leftwith 38 degrees so anyway how's thatthat's really mostly what you need toknow when you're trying to work out theunknown angles within a triangle in thatgeometric sort of sense like this okayah so hopefully you found this videohelpful we will get on to our some morestuff with geometry in future videosI'll have to see that but
