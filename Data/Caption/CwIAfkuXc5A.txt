all right this is pretty exciting we'regoing to look at order out of chaoswe're not just going to pick numbers outof the air I've actually organizedsomething here for us I've got some unoplaying cards okay I've got nine andthey're all different which is importantso first of all what I'm going to do isI'm going to give it a very light shotlet's put it out hereso we've got nine six four five oneseven two three and eight okay so let'slook at these so this is these are ninecards in a particular order particularpermutation let's see if we can findfour cards that are in ascending orderso ascending order so we can see we'vegot a four here we've got a five we'vegot a seven and we've got an eight okayso they didn't need to be right next toone another but we found four five seveneightokay how about four cards in descendingorderall right so nine is a good startbecause that's as high as you can get sowe've got nine six five and one or wecould have had two or we put ahead threeso look at this here now Brady let'slook at this we've got nine cards sothat means that we have nine factorialdifferent ways to organize them which is360 2880 permutations but there is 1764ways that you can organize these ninecards such that there are no fournumbers in ascending order or descendingorder and I know you want what you'rethinking why is that a square numberyeah I wasn't below there because it isit's 42 squaredand the reason why is because itactually follows this Marvis littleformula here nine factorial on 1 to the1 by 2 to the 2 by 3 to the 3 by 4 tothe 2 by 5 to the 1 all squared but thepoint is this is some serious maths so1764 divided by 3 6 2 8 8 0 isapproximately equal to 0.5 percent so ata chance if you just take it at randomthere's a point 5 percent chance thatyou can actually put this in an order sothere's no for increasing or decreasingokay so Brady would you like to makesome money I'm willing to put down 20pounds okay 20 pounds against aprobability of 0.5 percent at random butI think you're pretty smart so if you'reable to organize this in a way thatthere's no for increasing or decreasingthat's yours good as long as you likeokay my 20 pounds is insanedo you wanna have another go it'll be asmaller denomination all right here wegohere we go a little bit of that's theonly time I'm interested in gamblingactually just testing you okay so thisis it this is the way we do it what youdo is you split it up into groups ofthree and you go like this you go dothatdata okay so looking at it from left toright what I've done is that you can seeit goes three two one six five four nineeight seven so the maximum of descendingis 333 and then if you want to go forascending all right what you do is youbasically you can only take one fromeach of these groups so it doesn'tmatter which one so you could go like 25 8 for example or you could pick anyone so you could go 1 4right but if we add one more card okaythe beautiful zero all bets are offliterally and I'll tell you why isbecause if you have ten cards whathappens is if I put my zero herewherever I put it I'm always going tocreate for ascending or for descendingrun so if I put my zero here you can seeit goes zero one four seven in thatparticular permutation if I put it hereit doesn't change if I put it here itdoesn't change okay if I put it herealright I no longer can do that here butnow look what I've got three two onezero and that doesn't change if I put ithere here here here or here okay nowthat is not only just for thatparticular permutation it so happensthat for ten factorial permutationswhich is three six two eight eight zerozero there are now zero ways to find nofour numbers are sending or descendingorderno all right which is a strong resultwhich means we've got order out of chaoswhy should that be the case there's asecond video in which Simon explains allthe mathematics behind what's going onin this video if you'd like to see itthere'll be a link in the descriptionand on the screen it's about eight ornine minutes long so I thought I'd do itseparately and keep this video a bitshorter if you'd like to see my reallyembarrassing attempt at arranging thecards which cost me twenty pounds I willmake that available but it's going to bea bit of a catch have a look in thevideo description and I'll explain howyou can see it
