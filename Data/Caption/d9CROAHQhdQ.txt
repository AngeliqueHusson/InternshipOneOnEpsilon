welcome to another one of my videos myname is Chris and here in this problemwe have a triangle inside of a rectangleand on the graph one of the points ofthe triangle starts at the origin andthe other two points are labeled X and ythe coordinates for point X are a B andthe coordinates for point Y are C and Dthe question for this problem is findthe area of this triangle in terms ofABC and D once again find the area ofthis triangle in terms of a B C and D sotake your time pause this video if youfeel like working on this problem and Iwill show you the solution in fivesecondsso the only thing we need to solve thisproblem is the formula for the area of atriangle but the reason why I like it somuch is because we need to think outsidethe box so the first thing I want to doto solve this problem is labeleverything that we can and notice insideof this rectangle we have threetriangles that are not shaded so let'slabel these triangles one two and threeand let's start by looking at trianglenumber one well using the coordinates aB we know that the base of this triangleis going to have a distance of a and weknow the height of this triangle isgoing to have a distance of B now let'slook at triangle number two well youknow from the coordinates CD that thebase of this triangle is going to have adistance of D and the height of thistriangle is going to have a distance ofC and now let's look at triangle numberthree well using both coordinates x andy we know that one side of this triangleis going to have a distance of a minus Cand the other side of this triangle isgoing to have a distance of D minus B sonow that we labeled everything still howdo we find the area of the shadedtriangle well if we take the area of theentire rectangle and we subtract theareas of triangles 1 2 & 3 what we haveleft over is going to be the area of theshaded triangle which is what we aresolving for all right so now let's makeeverything into a formula well we knowthe area of the rectangle is equal tothe length times the width so the areaof our rectangle is going to be equal toa times D and now we can subtract theareas of triangles 1 2 & 3 we know thatformula for the area of a triangle is1/2 the base times the height so thearea of triangle number 1 is going to be1/2 times a times B the area of trianglenumber 2 is going to be 1/2times C times D and the area of trianglenumber three is going to be one halftimes a minus C times D minus B allright so now we can simplify this onehalf a minus C times D minus B byfoiling and after we do this we're goingto have a one-half ad a negativeone-half a be a negative one-half CD anda positive one-half BC now notice how wehave some terms that cancel each otherout we have a positive one-half a B anda negative one-half a B that cancel eachother outand we also have a positive one-half CDand a negative one-half CD that alsocancel each other outand if we simplify this whole entireequation we have ad minus in parenthesesone half ad plus one half BC and now wecan get rid of the parentheses thenegative sign in front of theparentheses is going to turn bothpositive terms negative so we're goingto have a negative one-half ad and anegative one-half BC and we can simplifythis even further we still have two liketerms so we have an ad and a negativeone-half ad if we simplify these liketerms one minus one half is equal to apositive one-half ad and we're still notfinished we can factor out the 1/2 thatboth of these terms have in common so ifwe factor out this one half we have onehalf and in parentheses we have ad minusBC and this is the solution to ourproblem thank you so much for watchingif you enjoyed this I have many morevideos just like it so check them out ifyou want also let me know you thoughtabout this video in the comments belowor did you love it or do you want to seeme do things differently let me knowwhat you thoughtthank you so much for watching again andI will see you in my next video
