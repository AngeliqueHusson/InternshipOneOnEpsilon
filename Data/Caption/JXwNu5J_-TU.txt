of all the in-center it's where thethree angle bisectors okay intersectthat's called a point of concurrency andthat point of concurrency is called thein-centerso let's go ahead and start by drawingthe three angle bisectors and I'll showyou how that works so let's go ahead ofthis vertex over here and what we'regonna do is we're going to bisect thisangle so I'm going to draw in our cliqueso okay and then we're going to usethese two points where it intersects thesides of the angle and we're going todraw two more arcs okay one and thenfrom this point here to now if we goahead and draw a ray through this vertexand through this point of intersectionthat's going to be the angle bisectorit's gonna be cutting that angle and ahalf okay so you can see that this angleis congruent to this angle so you'rewith me so farso let's go ahead and go over to thisother angle and let's do the same exactprocess we're going to bisect the angleso I'm just gonna draw an arc and I'mgoing to use these two points where itintersects the sides of the angle andI'm going to draw two more arcs whoopsjust looked a little bit there okaythere we go and so what we're going todo is going to again draw an anglebisector from here to the point ofintersection like that and then if we goahead and go from this third angle we'regonna do the same thing we find theangle bisector so I'm going to go aheadand draw that in there and use the twopoints open that up a little bit moreone and two and then what we're knees goahead and draw a ray from this vertexthrough that point of intersection andyou can see pretty pretty close you cansee that's where the three anglebisectors are Crossing is right here atthis point that's the in-centerokay now the next thing you want to dookay to get an accurate drawing is wewant to find the shortest distance fromthis point to one of the sides of thetriangle okay that's going to be theradius of our circle and what we'regoing to be doing is going to beinscribing a circle inside of thetriangle so it's going to just barelytouch the edges of the triangle so wewant to be accurate about this processI'm going to use this point I'm going tofind the shortest distance which is theperpendicular distance from this pointto this line so I'm going to go aheadand do that I'm going to make it an arcsuch that it intersectsthe side of the triangle okay at twopoints okay there and I'm going to usethese two points to draw two more arcsone and two and then I'm going to do isI'm going to draw a line segment throughthis point and this point and that'sgoing to be the perpendicular to theside of the triangle so let me go aheadand do that okay so you can see thatcame out pretty goodthis is a ninety degrees right there andthen now what you want to do is you wantto use your compass as a measuring toolyou want to open it up so that it'smeasuring from here to just the edge ofthe triangle we're just barely thecircle is just going to barely touch thetriangle so there we go right there sonow what I'm going to do is I'm going togo ahead and draw the circle okay okaynow my drawing wasn't perfect but whatshould happen if you are very accurateabout everything is this circle shouldjust come just where it just barelytouches the edge of the triangle here itbarely touches the edge of the trianglehere and it's going to really touch theedge of the triangle right there and ifyou're to draw you know a perpendicularfrom this point to where it just barelytouches the edge of the triangle likethat what do you know about these threelengths well they're going to becongruent because they're the radii okayof this circle so that's the idea behindthe in-center you find the three anglebisectors the point where they cross iscalled the in-center and then what thatallows you to do is it allows you toinscribe I mean you're drawing a circleon the inside of the triangle such thatit just barely touches the edges of thetriangle okay it's perpendicular atthose points there and then the threeradii okay are gonna all be congruent toone another and that's another propertyyou know to this construction so I hopethis helped you understand how toconstruct the in-centergo ahead and subscribe to the channelcheck out more construction videos on myyoutube channel Mario's math tutoringand I look forward to helping you in thefuture videos I'll talk to you soon
