how do we find the surface area of acuboid this three-dimensional shape iscalled a cuboid it is bounded byrectangles from all sides the mostimportant thing we should know about acuboid is that it is defined by itslength breadth and height we call them LB and H respectively we now need tounderstand how its surface area iscalculated its surface area will be thesum of the areas of the six rectangleswe look at each rectangle closely thearea of the rectangle we see in thefront will be L multiplied by H and thearea of the rectangle at the back willalso be L multiplied by H so the sum ofthese two will be LH + LH let's removethese two now the area of the rectangleat the bottom is L multiplied by Blength x breadth the area of therectangle on top will also be the sameas that of the bottom their sum will belb plus lb now let us take these two tothe side we have covered front and backtop and bottom what remains is the sitefaces the sum of the areas of therectangles at the sides will be BH plusBH area of each rectangle is base xheight look at each group this will be 2LH this will be 2 lb and this will be 2bh so for a cuboid with lb and h asdimensions the surface area will equalto l h plus 2 lb plus 2 bh as 2 is acommon factor to all the terms we writeit as 2 multiplied by l h plus lb plus bh that's how simple the concept ofsurface area is we just needlook at each surface individually andadd the surface areas within surfacearea there is a concept of lateralsurface area remember one simple thinglateral means side so this wouldactually mean the surface area ofrectangles at the sides there are foursuch rectangles this one this one thisone and the one at the back in terms ofsurface area you can also look atlateral as everything except the top andthe bottom the two green and the two redrectangles make up the lateral surfacethe lateral surface area just equals thesum of the areas of these fourrectangles the sum of the greenrectangles would be BH plus BH and thesum of the red rectangles will be LH +LH the total lateral surface area willbe twice LH plus BH where do we use thisconcept of lateral surface area wellhere's one of the applications if youwant the exterior of your house paintedyou do not paint all surfaces you justpaint the sides not the roof or theflooryou
