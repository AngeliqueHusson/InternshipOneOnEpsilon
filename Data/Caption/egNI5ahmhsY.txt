in this example we're given that a coinis tossed twice and were asked to findthe probability of getting heads andheadsit's important to understand that thetwo coin tosses are called independentevents because the outcome of the firstcoin toss does not affect the outcome ofthe second coin toss to find theprobability of independent events wefirst find the probability of each eventthen we multiply the probabilitiestogether so in this problem P of headsand heads means the same thing as P ofheads times P of heads so let's start byfinding the probability of getting headson our first coin toss since there'sonly one way to get heads in a coin tossand there are two possible outcomesheads or tails the probability ofgetting heads on our first coin toss isone-half next let's find the probabilityof getting heads on our second coin tosswhich would also be one-half so we have1/2 times 1/2 now multiplying across thenumerators 1 times 1 is 1 andmultiplying across the denominators 2times 2 is 4 so 1/2 times 1/2 is 1/4which means that the probability oftossing a coin twice and getting headsand heads is 1/4
