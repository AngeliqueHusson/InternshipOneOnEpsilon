let me try drawing the 45-45-90 trianglehere this angle measures 45 degrees andso does this one we say it's specialbecause given any one side of thistriangle we can easily find the lengthsof the other twoit means given one side we can find thelengths of all the sides we also knowthat sides opposite equal angles areequal so a B will be equal to BC andas-90 is greater than 45 both thesesides will be smaller than AC in the45-45-90 triangle the three sides are inthe ratio 1 is to 1 is 2 root 2 invariable terms if a b is a then bc willalso be a and AC will be a root 2 let'sexperiment with numbers what if a B is 3if this length is 3 then this one aswell has to be 3 so BC will be 3 andbased on the ratio AC will be 3 root 2this was easynow what if AC is 4 if AC is 4 then a Bwill equal 4 by root 2 multiplying awith root 2 gives us a root 2multiplying 4 by root 2 with root 2gives us 4 and VC will also equal 4 byroot 2 and just like I asked you in the30-60-90 video what should we do if weforget this ratio if we forget the ratioall we need is to draw the 45-45-90triangle again as both these sides areequal let's call them X and let's callthis one y as this is a right trianglebased on the Pythagoras theorem we cansay that x squared plus x squared isequal to y squared so 2x squared willequal Y squared transposing to to theother side we get x squared as Y squaredby 2 andtaking the square root on both sides weget X as Y by root 2 y will be X root 2and that gives us the ratio as X is 2 Xis 2x root 2 or 1 is 2 1 is 2 root 2 sowe just applied the Pythagoras theoremin this triangle and we have the ratiowe're looking for
