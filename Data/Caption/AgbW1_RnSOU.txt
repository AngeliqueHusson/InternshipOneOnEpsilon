okay in this video I want to do somemore grass graph transformations andbasically we're going to be puttingeverything together so in some of theother videos I did horizontal andvertical stretching compressing shiftingreflections about the x and y axis so inthis problem what I'm going to do isactually use those ideas on these twoproblems maybe I'll get through both ofthem in this video if not I'll do thesecond one here just a different one sofor this first one here y equalsabsolute or excuse me negative two timesthe absolute value of x over three plusone basically what I'm going to do iswhen I do these the way I think aboutthem is I kind of graph them in piecesyou know so you want to kind ofrecognize the basic graph that we'reusing here the thing that sticks out tome is the absolute value and if you'rerecall the absolute value kind of lookslike a V if we plug in a few points weget one onemaybe I'll plug in another one say threethree likewise on the left side yournegative one one and up here at negativethree three okay so there yeah that'sjust my graph absolute value of X what Iwant to graph next is I kind of start Iwork inside out so next I'm going tograph absolute value of x over three orequivalently that would be the samething as 1/3 X ok so sorry for my littlecruddy X and y-axis remember if youmultiply on the inside if the numbersbetween 0 & 1 and actually stretches itso this 1/3 is actually goingto stretch our graph out by a factor ofthree okay so instead of being at oneone notice now if you plug three inyou'll get three over threeyou'll get one out okay so againoriginally it says to attain a height ofone I had to go one unit out again I'mstretching it by a factor of three sonow I'm gonna have to go three units outto achieve that same height of one unitmaybe we'll put a point on the otherside as well so here's negative threecomma one the next thing I'm gonna do isbased on this graph so this is kind of Iguess you can think about this as beingthe second step next what I'm gonna dois graph the negative two I'm gonnagraph negative two times the absolutevalue of x over three okay sowe'll have to do a couple things on thisway remember a negative out front flipsyour graph about the x-axis so my graphis gonna be somewhere down here okaywith its little V shape and remember thetwo has the effect of multiplying they-coordinates so it's gonna stretch itvertically but it's also gonna flip itabout the x-axis so maybe let's pick ona point here if you think about thisoriginal point 3 comma 1 well if youflip it it would be a 3 comma negative 1but again we have to multiply they-coordinates basically by negative 2which is why again it's flipping in thefirst place so our 3 comma 1 point isgonna get moved down to 3 comma negative2 and again since the graph is symmetricabout the y-axis you can think about itthe same way our negative 3 comma 1point if you multiply the y-coordinateby negative 2 that's what you're doingit's now going to flip it so that thegraph is downstairs as well so there'snegative 3 comma negative 2 here's thepoint 3 comma 2 and again that goes withthe graph of negative 2 times theabsolute value of x over 3 well we'realmost there the only thing we have leftto do is tag on our plus 1 so rememberif you throw on a plus 1 that simply hasthe effect of moving your graph up 1unit so let me erase my original onehere and now we'll do the final graph ofnegative two times the absolute value ofx over three plus 1 when we erase thisbottom as wellokay so remember all the plus one allthat's going to do it's going to takethis original graph we have here on theright hand side and simply move it upone unit so the top of the the functionwas there at zero zero so if you movethat up one unit that's simply going tobe sitting at the point 0 comma 1negative 3 negative 2 if you move thatup one unit it's now going to be sittingat negative 3 comma negative 1likewise 3 2 is now going to be sittingat the point whoops this should be 3negative 2 over there obviously so nowinstead of being at negative 2 it willbe at 3 comma negative 1 and again weplay connect the dots the shape staysthe same we just move the graph up oneunit so and there would now be our finalgraph negative 2 times the absolutevalue of x over 3 plus 1 okay so youknow a few different things I'm kind ofdefinitely going through every step Ithink if you have some experience youcan do these almost you can go from thefirst of last you know I'm basicallydoing this in my head I think theabsolute value of X well the 3 is goingto take my V and stretch it out furtherthe negative 2 is then gonna flip itupside down so that I know I basicallyget a graph like thatan upside-down V and then the plus 1 issimply going to move my graph up 1 unitso I know it would have some sort ofshape roughly like that all right wellobviously I don't think I'm gonna havetime to do the other one in this videobut stick around andor look clothes it should be nearby feelfree to visit my website they should beright next to each other along with theother general graph transformationinformation
