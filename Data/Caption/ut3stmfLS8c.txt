in this video we're going to be taking alook at two concepts in set theory oneof those being a union the other onebeing an intersection to describe eachof these to get an understanding of whatthey mean it's going to be easier if wedo this using a Venn diagram so if I amgoing to represent a union that isliterally the definition of a unionwould be putting something together soif I had two individual sets and I wasgoing to Union them together it wouldend up being all subs both of the setsso when I've been diagram scenario thisis what a union looks like on the otherhand an intersection if I had twoindividual sets and I wanted to look atjust the intersection it would be thepart that overlaps of the two sets so itwould be just the intersection or thepart that overlaps so for a visualrepresentation of what each of thosemean a Venn diagram is a really nice wayto look at it now for the examples thatwe do we're actually going to be usingsets of numbers so in these first twoexamples right here we could supposethat you are given say set a and n set ait's 0 1 3 & 5 and set B is 0 1 2 & 4 sofrom given that information I can find aunion B Union means it's all of bothsets put togetherall right so each number that is in bothsets all put together in a final set nowthere's a 0 on both of them however I'monly going to write that 0 one time allright there's a 1 in both of them thereis a 2 in this one so I have to includeit because I'm including every number inboth of the sets there's a 3 in thefirst set there's a 4 in the second oneand there is a 5 there in the last oneso it's all the numbers in both of thosetwo sets put together as a union as asecond example if I wanted to find aintersect B okay I want to find thosenumbers which are in both sets okay sowe look through there a zero is in bothsets and the one is in both sets andthat's all that is in both sets so thereis my intersection all right now showingproblems and examples like this they cangive you to find those initial sets andthen ask you to find the intersection orthe Union all right or in this thirdexample they don't have to define themas in this a set a and this is set Bthey can write a problem out like thisusing either an intersection or a Unionsymbol in the middle and just puttingboth sets on both sides so this onewould be I would be taking the set 1 4 7and I would be intersecting that withthe set of 2 6 & 8 all right sointersection the numbers that would beand duplicated in both sets well in thisscenario I do not have any so this isconsidered to be what's called the emptyset because there are no elements inthis set which fulfill the intersectionall right so empty set is a definitionof what that would be called it couldalso be called a null set as well andthere are two mathematical symbols thatyou could write as your answer one ofthem would literally be a set of setbrackets with nothing inside of itshowing an empty set right there or thecommon notation for an empty set wouldbe a 0 with a line through it so twodifferent ways to represent the emptyset when the intersection does notcontain any elements in common so just areally brief introduction on twoconcepts two very simple concepts thatyou would find in set theory definitelythanks for watching don't forget tosubscribe to the channel and share withyour friends thanksyou
