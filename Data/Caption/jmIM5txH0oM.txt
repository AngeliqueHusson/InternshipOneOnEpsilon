I could I am welcome to the Tech mathchannel in this video I what I'm gonnabe having a look at this how to mentallyadd and subtract larger numbers oohI'm gonna deal with two-digit numbersfor the minute power okay but these aregonna be looking at how to add andsubtract these in your head they looksome people straight away all think thisis good news you don't know how to dothis already and look personally I'vealways been this a little bit easier butnot I'll show you the way that I tend towork this out because it's not somethingthat comes naturally to everybody okayah and if it doesn't don't worry I'mgonna show you how how we do it okay sothis is a really good skill which youcan do either you will be able to doeasily so I'll start with an examplehere what about something like whatabout I say this 43 + 17 do you get 60straightaway well I'll show you the waythat I work these out 43 + 17 okay theway then I think about this is as far asI actually my mind orders are like thisand probably a few people might have afew comments and this and I'll beinterested to see how people's mindsdiffer when they do this my mind what itwould do would do this I would go 43 + 7which were they cool 50 and then what Iwould do is I would add so that's the 7there I've added and then I would addthe 10 so plus 10 equals 60 okay andthat's how I mentally add things okayah look sometimes you might decide thatyou're gonna add the 10 first or you'regonna add the 7 first it doesn't reallymattertypically it's a lot easy to add thesmall numbers on rather than going 70plus 43 but again that doesn't reallymatter either but you could have quiteas easily gone 43 plus 10 is 53 plus 7is 60 okay you see what I mean with thatso it's a really really easy trick okayand some people are gonna go hey that'snot a trick at all and look in some waysfor some people this is something thatinstinctively comes to them okay butthere's a degree of people that won't sothis is the people this videos for okaywhat about something like 37 plus 68okay37 plus 68 hopefully you get the answerof 105 so 37 plus 68 so you remember howI did this what this a chord is I gofirst off I'm adding the 60 here or Ican add the I pan I'm going to add the60 on this one so 37 plus 60 is ninetyseven plus eight ninety seven plus eightis a hundred and five okay but I couldhave just as easily done the other one Icould do on 37 plus eight is forty fiveand then on 45 plus 60 is a hundred andfive okay it doesn't really matter whichway you do it with that okay so this isthe way that when you see people addingin there they're really really areproficient at it this is how we can doit okay it's a matter of first jumpingwith the units or the tens and thenjumping with the other one okay sohopefully you good with this what aboutwe try a subtraction here all rightwhat about say 80 to take away 14 I'llwrite that down while you work it out82 take away 14 so what answer did youget for thatso 82 take away four so 82 take awayfour equals 78 and then 78 take away the10 equals 68okay so you do have to do those littlesteps in it okay you have to account foreverything with those so eighty to takeaway 1468 yeah so we're going down byfour to 78 then down by ten to 68 noproblem okay what about to give youanother example here what about this onewhat about we do 55 take away 39 so takeaway the nine first and you could getthe answer of yeah 46 take away the 30we end up with 16 okay so this one 55take away the 9 take away 9 equals 46and then from the 46 we go down threesteps 30 steps then we get 16 how do youfind that no problemwell I'll tell you what what I'll do isI'll put a couple of examples up hereand we'll see here you can go with themokay what about got a number of themsome additions of subtraction ones andwe'll see here you go you might pausethem and then see here you go alright sowhat about 72 takeaway 24 33 plus 29 andI wonder 100 yet actually 105 plus 77okay see here you go with those allright so first off 72 we're gonna addwe're gonna we're taking away I've beenon start adding well it's a bit of atrick there isn't it better payattention to the actual sign 72 take 4is 68take 20 is 48 okay how did you go withthat hopefully good 33 plus 9 is 42 plus20 is 60 to a hundred and five plusseven is 112 plus 70 is a hundred andeighty two they're not too bad are theyhopefully you do pretty good with thosepractices a lot some people again aregonna be fine with those already andthey're probably tuned out alreadybut if you're just starting with thosegood luck on those it's a really reallygreat skill and the more you do thatthis is one of these basic math singswhich is probably the most importantthing you get and that's why I'm makingthis video okay so keep practicing itand hopefully you get really good at itI'll see you next time
