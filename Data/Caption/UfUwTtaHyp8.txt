this math motor video is the second in aseries of videos covering the area oftwo-dimensional shapes and here we havea rectangle and a rectangle has four90-degree right angles one in eachcorner and a lot of times in textbooksand on worksheets you will see thesenotch marks here in this single notchmark corresponds to this single notchmark and it basically says that thewidth across the top is the same as thewidth across the bottom and likewisethese double notch marks correspond tothese double notch marks and it statesthat this length here on the right isthe exact same as this length here onthe left okay well with that being saidwe can just multiply the length timesthe width and that will give us the areaof this rectangle so the formula is areaequals length times width this we'llfind is our area of the rectangle lstanding for length W standing for widthso let's say our length is 3 inches andour width is 8 inches okay so we canjust plug in our numbers to our formulahere and we'll say that a short for areais equal to 3 times 8 and we know that 3times 8 is 24 so we write our answer asa area equals 24 inches squaredand squares you ask yes any time wemultiply our lengths three across andeight down we're going to get squares24 to be exact so we'll just write it inhere 24 inches squared is the area ofthis rectangle thanks for watching we'llsee you next timeyou
