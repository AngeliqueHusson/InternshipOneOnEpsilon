this question is all about distancespeed and time I'm sure you will havelearnt about it at school but here's aquick refresher in Keith's case you'veforgotten so the first thing you need todo is draw a triangle like this one andyou need to populate the letters inalphabetical order so dear the top s tothe left and T to the right in thisexample we've got a train that travels1250 kilometers in three hours and weneed to work out what the average speedis so by referring to a triangle if youcover over the S which is what you wantto work out you can see that you have Dover T so populate this with the valuesthat you have so 1250 over 3 1250divided by three is four hundred andseventeen kilometers per hour now thistriangle will work if you're trying tofind out the distance so distance wouldbe speed times time or if you're tryingto work out the time then that'sdistance divided by speed
