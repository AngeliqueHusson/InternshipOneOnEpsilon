you know welcome to take math channelwe'll be having a look at in this videois we're going to be having a look athow to work out their unknowing sides ona right angle triangle like I using thisreally really great little liar theoremit was discovered boys going abouttwo-and-a-half thousand odd years ago inancient Greece is guy called Pythagorasfelt it was that cool theorem they namedit after Moses called Pythagoras'stheorem so basically the theorem ofPythagoras is this it says for anyright-angled triangle this is a trianglethat has 90-degree angle here we oftenput a little R square little thing downthere to show that it's 90 degrees butsays that in a right angle try thelongest side we're going to call you thehypotenuse can be worked out okay sofirst I'll write this great word offhigh hot and use okay I'll start allthis again so for any right angletriangle the longest side is known ashis hypotenuse or the theory ofPythagoras states that you can add thesquares of the lengths of these twoshorter sides here so you get the squareof this side and the square of this sideand if you add them together they'regoing to be equal to the square of thehypotenuse okay did you get that thereso the way that they write this is isthey say they have given these guysletters and you probably might have youmay or may not this may be the firsttime you've heard of these they call theshorter sides a and B now thishypotenuse here C and it leads to thisreally really really often used formulain maths which is this one that Isquaredthis site here for number squared plus Bsquared this side here squared equals Csquared okay this one here that's for aright angle triangle and this is areally really great thing to be usingyou can use this in carpentry whenyou're trying to square up things andmake walls go at a 90 degree angle soit's a really really great little methodof working out Unknowing diagonals areknown sides squaring up things that youwant to be 90 degrees here okay so it'sa great little thing to be able to useso let's use this theory this theoremright now okay and you need givenexamples like this one okay so we havehere we have a couple of shorter sideshere we're going to work off just theseshorter sides to work out this longestside to start off with it I'll makeanother video where we can do the otherones when we work off through we workthese shorter sides out so say forinstance we want it to work out thelength of this longest side from herethrough to here the way we can do thisis using Pythagoras theorem okay so asquared plus B squared now want to getback to this is a really importanttriangle this one in particular equals Csquared we know that writing will trywhat's kind of here I wouldn't put it inthere ever wasn't okay because we'realso going to look at how we can dealwith trying to not write a legal trialyou know some other videos how we can wecan under its eyes on those so first offit doesn't matter which one you call aor B as long as you recognize that a andB in the two shorter sides so let's callthis one a and this one B so a squaredis three squaredplus B squared which is four squaredequals C squared okay three squared isnine plus four squared 4 times 4 whichis 16 and this is equal to C squared nowI'm running out of space here so I'mgoing to say this also equals 9 plus 16what does that equalthis is equal to 25 okayso C squared equals 25 this this meansthat C times C equals 25 we can work outC by working out the square root of 25okay what number we times by itself toget 25 and the answer to this is 5because 5 times 5 is 25 so longest sidehere is 5 centimeters and this is suchan important little triangle this thisis known as that they have it so we hada 3 and a 4 and a 5 and often what I'mteaching a bunch of carpentry guys aremy teacher I often really stress theimportance in this one because you don'tnecessarily have to remember I squared Bsquared C squared all the time whenyou're squaring up walls but the majorthing that you can do is if you want toactually get a wall coming out at 90degrees is you can use this idea of a 34 5 triangle okay we actually call thisa 3 4 5 triangleokay and it can be worked out usingPythagoras's theorem but if you can dothis and you have your tape measures youcan work this out and you can measurefrom here to here is three meters andthis wall that you want can say the wayI'd usually do it as I'd get this wouldbe the wall I've been putting in and Iput a three-meter coming out with thenI'd have it from this point here alsofive minutes and where they made upshould be 90 degrees so it's a greatlittle way of actually also working atninety degrees from a point okay let'shave a look at another example here sosay we had this particular example andwe work out this hypotenuse here theright angle triangle where we can usethis a squared plus B squared equals Csquared okay so I squared I'm going tocall a this time this one down here okaywhy not okay so this is 9 squared plus Bsquared which is 2 squared equals Csquaredokay 9 squared nine nines are 81 plus 4squared that 2 squared which is 4 isgoing to be C squared which is equal to81 plus 4 which is 85okay so what we could do is we couldactually call this arm we could work outthis as a cert and that's sort of dealwhich off will get other videos as wellbut for this I'm just going to actuallycome out with a fairly rough answerusing a calculator okay so if we were toget 85 we can work out the square rootof this by going inversex squared so it's nine point two onenine so we're just going to cause ninepoint two so this is equal to nine pointtwo I probably should be saying that Cis equal to the square root of 85 - C isequal to nine point two centimetersshe's a high palpable unit up there Idid it's really bad okay this iscentimeters okayit was no big cross waiting put that inthere so really important with theunit's in there I so nice forget as wellokay let's have a look at anotherexample so say we had here 12centimeters and seven centimeters againthe same formula a squared plus Bsquared equals C squaredalright let's substitute it some valueshere so let's call a squared 12 hereokay so 12 squared plus B squared 7squared equals C squaredokay so 12 12 144plus 7 squared 7/7 a 49 but this equalsC squared which is equal to 49 plus 144is 193 okay 193 that means C is going tobe equal to the square root of 193 andthat off the top of my head I don't knowI'll be honest so I'm going to go 193inverse-square oh the wrong one therelet's type that in again 193 inversesquare is thirteen point eight nine okaythirteen point eight nine are better forthe units at eight centimeters okay sohow did you go with this now the nextvideo I'm going to be putting up here isgoing to be looking at how we can workout these are know inside C I'm going tolook at how we can work out if thetriangle is not quite 90 degrees what wecan do then okay so hopefully I'll seeyou then see you next time bye
