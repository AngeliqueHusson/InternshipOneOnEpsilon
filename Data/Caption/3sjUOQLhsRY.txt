to do more on factoring trinomials andsolving them ready class I say math yousay yay yay yay ok so many home iswondering this is my students jacket soI don't blend in with the back I'm afloating head okay look okay yeah thatall right oh yeah we just wrappedanother class psychokay here we go then AG squared plus 29X plus or 0 all right question alreadylove it go trinomial what is it Chinareal good trinomial is a polynomialwhich is an equation with three termsone polynomial is a many terms equationso I don't know the type of a trinomialis a type of polynomial excellent and wejust heard someone said I'm taking notesthat's fantastic that's great I'm haveyou said that okay so first things firstis their greatest common factor nothere's no greatest common factor so wecan start our factoring process alrightso if we were to do that boiling processF times F what times what is 7x squaredso Allah saying yeah but so then in thenext index like each side in each thingso one times one is seven x squared thiswould be 7 X 7 X 7 X and X that clear 7xall right7x next good so we started with that onenow we're going to go to this one whattimes what is 4what do you think yeah two and two arefour four and one the way you want tostart with let's try to tell let's trytwo and two we go 2 & 2all right so let's foil this dude if wewere to foil the check forget about thesigns for now even though we can tellit'll be both positive so 7x squaredright 7x squared 7x times 2 is 14 X 14 X2 X with 4 can these somehow add to make29 no no so is it - a - no let's try forone it's like a game show let's try 41ok what do you want to put the four whatdo you think what do you think can youtell where you want to put the four yeahyeah in that one the second one thesecond one interesting you should saythatcan you put in your own words why haveyou good to put the 4 here and not hereum oh oh I love that moment oh okay nogood okay so you have to in the L youhave to the four times 7x right rightwhich it would be 28 and 28 and thenplus the void Oh 29 exactly exactlywere you going to say that the oh say isthat your intention yeah good lessonokay good all right so let's make them ++ oil to check 7x squared 28 X X X 29 Xand for yes okay so the reason why butthe reason lies but before yeah in thesecond parentheses because it's biggerand so like it multiplies inside withthe seven yeah it'll multiply with theseven and that will make 28 and all weneeds one more may 29 in the firstparentheses and a would be multipliedlength right if you put the four herefour would be multiplied by x + 1 wouldbe multiplied by 7 X so I'll make like11 so you usually should you put thenumbers thank you know it depends whatthe middle term is celebrated brokenokay so you put the bigger number whereyou means put the bigger number stilllaughing that's awesome okayhow many factors are still here or howmany factor two you two factors okay sotwo factors you say each to 0 to solvebecause anything times 0 is 0 so we'regoing to set the first factor to 0 whichis 7 X plus 1 I have a question yes bestquestion what that's not the answerno no the answer is solve for x givenequals need to solve for absolutely thisis factored or not done solveokay so resent h factor to zero X plus 4equals zeroI think everyone's writing I don't seethat everyone's writing lookup oh andyeah so now we saw here we go - 1 7 xequals negative 1 5 by 7 by 7high-pitched hum I'm one-sixteenth Mousein other words great great right ok sothese are the two answers any questionswe solved both already we're gonna do 3more you ready ready game at pleasedon't do thatdo not be giggles you really awesomeladies and gentlemen we have the gigglesok to solve may your five refine allright it's all again to solve we need toset the equation equal to zero so how dowe make this side equal to zero pleaseadd three eight and nine for my sportwait wait wait please wait we're gonnaadd three and a to both sides well whyin your stance you just want o set it tozero times zerocombine it in tutor so we added 3/8 ofboth sides subtract 4 from both sidesoh oh okay leaving us with what minus 16minus 9 equals zero all right here we gois there a greatest common factorchelsea up oh yeah is there yeah oh waitno nothing goes into 8 6 & 9no all right so we go what times 1 is 8a squared do you think yes and then aokayhey na is possible it might even be theanswer my recommendation is try the lessextremes so what makes 8 instead of 8 &1 2 & 4 to support 4G for 2a and thenfor it so in this case generally we putthe for a here generally we're going toput the for a here or a all right soyou're right ay-ay-ay would work forthis part but we're putting myexperience do the less extreme onesfirst okaywhat do you think multiplies tonightmost likely 3 & 3 so let's put those inwe're going to leave off the signs fornow volunteer to foil check check yes um8a squared hey square good and then um12 okayand then six eight six a nine and nineis this good news this is good news it'sgreat news all right that's good that'spositive right there it's not good newsit's great okay which has to be negativewhich has to be positive so that theyadd to negative six yes in front of thesix in front of the six two should be anegative in front of the twelve shouldbe a positive all right so here we go iftwelve a should be positive what shouldbe positive here to create twelve a hopeyou see it hmm what wait are you thefirst one in the second one the secondone right this way check it out fourtimes three is twelve eight that's wherein the foiling thing all right so how dowe make negative six a you want to say Idon't like you want to say how do wemake negative 6x you put the negative infront of them all right coolso and now negative 3 times positive 3is negative good so this is our checkand it works question yes would it haveworked if we did like a interestingquestion is what if it worked if we'vedone eight a a no there's only oneanswer that all right so which is goodnews for me there's only one answer okayso I'm going to take this off you canput a line to it or whatever that wasour check we had factored we're one stepaway what do we do to each of thefactors yeah yeah oh yeah find outwhat's hereso we do four and minus three so ii bothto zero right yeahor a minus 3 equals 0 to a plus 3 equals0 and solve both of these i'm going todo this in a pedo modehere we go plus 3 plus 3 for a equals 3a equals 3 over 4 right lap you don'tmode I don't speak Spanish I wish I diddo you speak Spanish yes yeah hey you'regonna be shut up a bilingual game howwould you say hey I'll watch you that'dbe goodbring us some great over class anyquestions on these 2 enters 3 4 sonegative 3 halvesall right good so we set it to 0 rightwe set it to 0 then we factor becausethere's no greatest common factor wefactor and we try the less extremes likefor a and to a goodokay six times two squared minus 14xminus 12 equals zerookay it's a what is this calledwhat's this called these three termstrinomial we're going to factor sowhat's the first step in factoringalways greatest common factoris there one yeah yeah what is it - it'dbe - wait what - its greatest commonfactor not 4x- there's no X here does its first onehey what's that greatest common factoron all three terms - because he wasn'tall - goes in all of them has anythingelse going to all of them yeah likeisn't a number as a whole 6x - Aaronundistribute undistribute 2 times whatya is 6x squared is 3x squared 7 X minusseven X and then minus minus 6 equalszero L so we factored out - right wefactored out - and it's also great newsbecause this becomes much easier tofactor much easier alright so now wehave a trinomial we can't take out anymore factors so we turn it into our likeconducting college me - this how wouldwe do that good questionall right do you have to write this ohyeah yeah yeah - it's part of my okay uhwhat times what is 3x squaredyes 3x and X all right oh yeah 3x nextone times what is six what do you thinksix and one or two and three you want todo 6 and 1 6 & 1 6 & 1I'm not feeling the 6 & 1 well let'sthink about it look if I put the 6 I putthe 6 here that will make 18 X no justsit here yeah I put the 6 here I'll get6x + 1 X here Oh hope will be will be 6& 3 Omega 3 I'm killing the 3 & 2 yeahwe have to do three in two with two onthe link to here that's tutor let's tryit I want to put the 2 here let's try 2& 3yeah all right let's try so I'm notunderstanding multiplying to make 6okay time 3 & 2 okay all right so foilbut then what do I do with that I got itbut this to keep cool up okay but then 32 & 7yeah let's see if it works see if itworksboil boil the middle okay I squared Rnumber in thesix that ah yes but is it that so let'sfinish this process and we'll take thatquestion 3x squared exact 6 6 X 3 X 6can these somehow combine to make 7 OhNoso it's not 3 & 2 let's try 2 & 3ok 2 & 3 it'll matter the order mattersnow right the format is not so 3 + 2 isout these are out here we go 2 & 3let's give this a try someone else tofoil to check please yes but um six actswell let's do the UM no no no BoyleBoyle justice Oh what's this we're doingthe ready okay 3x squared 3x squared 9 X2 X 6 all right good news right okay sowhich one needs to be negative and whichone needs to be positive to makenegative 7 I heard it the nineties to benegative so if the 9 needs to benegative and the two needs to bepositive and the 6 needs to be negativeso let's to let us think about it how dowe make the negative how do we make 9negative 9 X strip yeah good Oh 9 is 3the 3 right because check it out 3xtimes negative 3 is negative 9x cool andthen 2 X needs to be positive so here itis confirmation also 2 times negative 3last step is negative 6wait so what what is the reason like whyis therebecause it was founded out at thebeginning and it's not doing it's notdoing anything correct it's not doinganything it's factored out okay you justignore my face I'll tell you what to dowith them now yeah I don't get why wecouldn't have used six of one itwouldn't worktying your paper it wouldn't work goingone answer okay so so this is so far sogood any questions on this yes yes let'ssay we didn't talk about the - whateversolution we would still be able tofactor yes yes we would still be able tofactor would just be bigger numbers oneone of them would be doubled because itdo distribute this to in here okay okayall rightoh you're saying if we did six and oneat the beginning that what you're saying6x and X I hear you're saying no no okayis that what happened if you take it toit all right here's how to solve thisthis two is extraneousmeaning it's unnecessary and it's notreally affecting the problem so a rulein math we can divide both sides by twowe divided both sides by two- what would happen to these two herethey're cancelling their Savior theywould cancel and the zero would stayzero fantastic Wow why would I make youwrite or why can't we we can sort of wecan you can ignore it if it's anequation you can ignore the - yeah ifyou're if you're dividing by it it'sgonna cancel anyway so I can't you justsay bye say bye slice yeah say bye ifit's an equation say bye but technicallywhat's happening is you're dividing bytwo I just want you to know the rulesso now let's rewrite 3x plus 2x minus 3equals 0 set both factors to zero equalszero X minus 3 equals zero alright Xhere equals negative 2/3 hopefully youcan solve that by now so track two onboth sides divide by 3 on both sidesdone and thenhere add three on both sides addressequals three so those are the twoanswers guys skipped a few steps hereI'm giving you credit for able to solvesimple equations Arniewhat's the time on the thing how much ofits past twenty thirty nine twentythirty nine all right that's a goodplace to cut okay any other questions onthis let me read you put oh yeah we'regonna say goodbye now okay so how wouldyou say bye mad is much like a car wetalk are the off what am I playingdoesn't is it all I'm still done
