good I'm welcome to take math channelthis video is can be looking at this howto add numbers together really reallyquickly okay so without much further adolet's go so how fast can you add thesetwo numbers together will give you acouple of seconds I'll give you thequestion of 624 plus 107 ready set gookay so the answer you should have gotyou'd have been 731 now if you've gotthat as the answer really really good ifnot okay we're going to be looking athow to do this today so what this isgoing to be looking at is sort of goingagainst what you've probably been taughtin our school we're usually what you dois you dad numbers from right here andyou'd add them this way okay so I'llgive you an example here if I was to runthis out what you'd probably get used toat school is you got taught we wouldwrite the numbers 624 down we'll writenumber 107 down little plus here to makeit nice and me and 4 plus 7 is 11 to putthe 1 there we carry the 1 and then 1plus 2 is 3 plus nothing is 3 and then 6plus 1 is 7but it seems always a bit funny becauseoften you don't really really want towrite the numbers down or time sothere's a bit of an easier way my mindof doing these and I'll show you how soI'll get rid of that there and okaythrough how I do it a different way howI do it going from right to leftnow you need to practice is just a tinybit but it's not actually too hard toget so first off I go 6 plus 1 is 7 nowbefore I write the 7 down I'd quicklylook at this column here now if thatwould quickly make sure that doesn't addto anything more than 10 and it doesn'tso if it doesn'tI just put the seven down okay now goingto this one two plus nothing well that'stwo and so quickly before I write thetwo down on the phone with this columnand I see if these two numbers add twomore than ten and they do that to elevenso instead of actually putting down tohere I put one more than two which is athree and then here 4 plus 7 is 11 and Ijust put the 1 here because I've alreadyactually added that one there I'vealready carried the one before I'veactually done it so hopefully you getwhat I mean there I'll give you anotherexample of this so will rub this out andI'll write something new on okay whatabout some random 782 plus 125 what doesthat equalokay so doing it the same way as I wasjust doing it first off we go to addthese two numbers together so 7 plus 1is 8 and we look at this numberis it above 10 well it is 10 times 10 orabove so I'm not only going to add 7plus 1 I'm going to add another one toit as well so first number is going tobe a 9 ok then I was left with that zerobefore when the eight plus two is zerothat was 10 so before I write the zerodown I look at this number is it above10 2 plus 5 no it's not at 7 so I canput my zero down and off and also putthis 7 down the answer 907 a pretty goodright okay let's give you something alittle bit a little bit further fromthis what about say something like 586plus792 make that make it numbers a bit bitbigger okay so the answer to this wouldbe 5 plus 7 is 12 so I gotta write the12 down but before I write and that'swho they're I look at these and theyabove 10 yes I write 13 down okay whatour leads up to 17 so before I write theseven down here from the 17 I look atthis next numbers do they go to about 10no they don't the 6 plus 2 is 8 so I putthe 7 to 7 down and I put the 8 downpretty good right alright so if youfollow this method and you should youactually hit this stage where youprobably you won't even want to starteven adding them on a bit of paper youcan start just adding them you know offthe top of your head okay hope thatworks for you see you next time
