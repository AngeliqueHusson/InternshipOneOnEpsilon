here's a tricky problem in how manydifferent ways can the letters of theword football be arranged such that allthe vowels are always together we aretalking about the word football hereindirectly we have been asked for thenumber of anagrams we can form using theword football anagram is the word formedby simply rearranging the letters ofanother word here we're talking aboutthe word football but are we asked forall possible anagrams of the wordfootball or are we given any conditionyes we have a condition the Wawel shouldalways be together the vowels of theEnglish alphabet are a e i o & u solet's look at the word football letterby letter the first letter is f not avowel the next two letters are oh and ohis the vowel we have seen that wheneverwe've seen such a condition where a fewletters are always together we considerthem as one element so let's not writethe O's here the next letter is T it'snot a vowel we write it next to F B isalso not a wobble a is a vowel so wedon't write it here the next two lettersare L and L is not a vowel we can writethem here the ones we have missed are ohoh and a so we write the vowels togetherhere as the vowels always have to betogether we consider them as one elementso after this assumption how manyelements do we have in all one two threefour five and six six elements do youremember the technique we used to solveanagram problems we have to find thenumber of anagrams possible for Mook asthere were four letters in all we wrotefour factorial first and then divided itby two factorial as a letter wasrepeated twice this is a superinteresting problem if you've understoodthis concept of forming anagrams firstlet's look at the six elements we have FBLL and bubbles these six elements canbe arranged in six factorial ways and dowe have a repetition in these six yesthe element L is repeated twice theother elements are distinct don't lookat the two ORS now don't forget this isone element so if we are looking atthese six only two are repeated Oh Oh ais different from each of these fiveokay so as two elements are repeated wedivide six factorial by 2 factorial isthis our answer this would have been ouranswer if the sixth element has just oneletter but it has three so with this wealso have to consider the arrangementsof these three letters FTB ll oo a isdifferent from FTB ll or a o or ft b lla oh oh now just focus on the sixthelement it has three letters out ofwhich two are repeated as it has threeletters we multiply these with threefactorial and as two are repeated wedivide this by two factorial this is ouranswer these many anagrams of the wordfootball can be formed such that all itsvowels are always togethersome of us I'm sure are still confusedlet's understand this again this is thefirst part of our answer six factorialover 2 factorial this is arranging sixletters out of which two are identicalhence six factorial divided by 2factorial and which were the sixelements one two three four five and sixand the letter L appears twice and thisis the other part of the answer where weare only looking at the sixth elementwhich has three letters three factorialways in which we can arrange threeletters and we divided by 2 factorial astwo letters are repeated as a matter offact if we work the second part out weget three what does 3 implyfor every case of the first part thereare two more possibilities of the secondif we look at this case for example wewill also have f DB ll o AO and f TB lLA or o solving this should give it theanswer as 1080 waysyou
