Today, M stands forMandelbrot setWe've all seen it, right? Let's just zoom in. What you find is all these amazingpictures here, like, these little baby MandelbrotsUhh, remember those we'll need them for laterOkay, now, the Mandelbrot set is actually just the black bitThat one here. The halo that you see around it-this one here, you get when you have a very very close lookat the data that you generate when you make up the Mandelbrot setNow, the inside's completely black- the dark side of the Mandelbrot setUmm, it's actually not that dark when you also have a really really close mathematical lookand that's what we're going to do today andWhen you have a close look, what you get to see is, for example this guy here or even betterthis guy therethe mysteriousBuddhabrot fractal.Uhh, well, I mean you can kind of see where the Buddha comes from, pretty obvious.There it isUmm, okay, so it's going to be about the dark side andI thought well, maybe, today my audience is going to be, ummDarthYou know, pretty obvious Darth's interested in the dark side, so I'll tell him about the dark side of the Mandelbrot set and[well], let's seeOkay, so what's the Mandelbrot set well? It looks like a set of points, but actually it's a set of numbersOkay, what are these numbers? Well, here are the real numbers.There's zero, there's one. You know, so every point that you see actually corresponds to a numberBut of course there's a lot more than the real numbers here for example. What's that point up there?What number is that? Well, that's i, the square root of-1. It's a complex number. AndYou know everything else that you see here is just complex numbersSo for example this guy over here is just 1 over here, 0.5 up here. So that's 1 plus0.5 times iNow you may know or may not know complex numbersDoesn't matterOnly thing you really need to know for todayis that they arebeautiful, veryImportant extension to the real numbers you can add them you can multiply them and that's actually what you [need] to do to figure outWhether one of those complex numbers is inside or outside the Mandelbrot set okay?now darth is really interested in figuring out for example whether the number 1 is inside the Mandelbrot setSo what is that you have to do? Well,he has to run this scheme here infinitely often. So what it does is it takes the number 1,sticks it in there where it says number andThat gets you a formula here, which is x squared plus 1?Now what we do is we initialize by sticking in 0 into this formulaAnd that gets us 0 squared plus 1 is equal [to]1 [now] [we] take what we get out here and stick it back in again. We get 1 squared plus 1 is 2,2 squared plus 1 is 5, 5 squared plus 1 is26 andSo on and actually in this [case]it's pretty obvious that what's going to happen is that themagnitude of the numbers that we're getting here is going to get bigger and bigger than it's actually going toapproach infinity as you kind of push this further and further andWhenever that happens you actually figure out that the number that we're talking aboutThat one here in the green rectangle is outside so magnitude exploding to infinity meansOutside the Mandelbrot set. Sorry Darth, 1's not for youOkay, well that's fine. It's fine.Now how can it not be? Well somehow the sequence has to be contained in a finite region. Let's give an example:so that minus 1 for example supposed to be inside the Mandelbrot set so we replace the 1 by a minus 1 andIt gives us a new formula x squared minus one we initializePut 0 in, 0 squared minus 1 is minus 1. Minus 1 squared is 1, minus 1 is 0.back to the beginning, and then of course things repeatMinus 1, 0, to infinity, it's not going to go anywhere. It's going to stay confinedAll right, and now we have to do this for every singlenumber that we see here andSee whether it's inside or outside. That is a lot of work and actuallyHow are we going to do this? We're going to do this infinite sequence? We can't really do that, right?I mean, you can't, I can't. I can't do this infinitely oftenWhat has been shown, what has been proven is that well you don't really have to waitTo the end of times to figure out whether we're going to infinity or not the only thing you need toKnow is whether a sequence strays at any time outside this yellow circle, if it does, it explodes to infinity, if it doesn'tWell, you can forget about it. And actually the whole Mandelbrot set isContained in this yellow disc. It doesn't doesn't go outside orDarth is not so happy because that obviously means wellit's actually not that big our Mandelbrot set, our dark side, but anyway let's continueSo what we actually do is we we set a [bailout] value to be able to approximate the Mandelbrot setso we set the bailout value for example to 500 so we iterate every single one of our sequences 500 times andIf by that time the sequence exits the yellow disc, we declareWhatever we're looking at at the moment to be outside and otherwise we declare to be inside, so we you knowWe're actually declaring some points to be inside that are not inside. Just because it takes them a lot longer to get outsideThe yellow Circle, but it's fine if you want a better picture,We'll just crank up the bailout value for example to [5000] or 50,000OkayLet's have a look at one of those points. Right so here we goSo we start and we want to figure out whether that thing is inside, or outsideWe'd set our bailout value to 500 we start okay?Second ones here third guy's here fourth guy's here fifth guy's there sixth guy's there seventh guy's outsidePerfect. We know this point isoutside the Mandelbrot setfantasticAnd now we also know [that] it took us seven steps to get outside so to actually get this halo that you see in allThe mandible pictures what we do is we color the outside points?According [to] how many steps then it takes them to to get outside the yellow circle hereOkay, so that was for example seven so all pointsCorresponding [sequences] take seven steps to get outside get color with the same color. That's how you get the halo nowYou can do something else. You [can] actually just plot all those escapingpaths, okayso all those escaping paths for lots and lots and lots of points outside the Mandelbrot set andthat sort of gives you a density plot ofpoints escaping to infinity andWhen you do that, you get these Buddha-brot pictures. They will also look different depending on where you set your bailout valueSo for example that one here corresponds to the bailout value of five hundred if you go for five thousandIt looks slightly different if you go for fifty thousand it looks slightly differentand now to get the color picture actually what people [have] done is they've taken these three pictures andmade them into the blue green and redChannel of AColor picture, so this one here really amazing now. This was actually invented by one of our regular viewersMelinda Greenit's aAmazing fractal, but actually hardly anything has been you know investigated hereSo there's a lot of things that need explainingNobody's really looked at thisSo if your budding mathematician this would be a really really nice object to look at to explain all these features here that you seeSo far what we've done is well. We've we've seen some light happening inside here, but that illumination was all byBasically points outside doing something now what I want to do is reallyMathematically drill into the into the inside and really show youWhat's going on? Not just talk [about] it, but [actually] show you what's what's going on?Okay, here we gowe're going to focus on the real numbers because there we can draw pictures andActually, it's just kind of parabolas which is going to be parabolas, so let's just go for an obvious point [a] zeroSo if you stick this into the formula, we will just get x-squared you can draw that that is and we can iterateNot very interested in this case. So what we do is, we make it a bit more interest by first going outsideOkay, so going outside so we go to this point here, which is 0.3. The picture,how does the picture change? Well, we just raise the parabola by 0.3. Okay? Now, we initialize with zeroOkay, out comes 0.3. That's just this distance hereNow how do you see in the picture what the next value is going to be when we stick point three inside?Visually that goes like this go upAnd we get the next value and we repeat and repeat and repeat and repeatAnd we get all the functional valuesThis is a very nice way of visualizing things, but there's actually an even better one and so for that onewe just put in the diagonal here andThen just watch watch this so we're going from zero okay from zero going up to the ParabolaHorizontal over to the Green up to the Parabolahorizontal over to the green up to the Parabola horizontal over to the green, and you just keep on going like this andWe actually get exactly the same sequence of numbers happeningBut we can kind of see at a glance how they happen, right?So we can kind of just in our mindSee that kind of zigzag between the Parabola and the green lines is really really niceNow your homework is going to be to explain why this works?Once we've got this picture. We can dynamically change it and actually observe what happens to the zigzagSo first let's let's go up okay, so first we go up herewe go, and you can see we're basically just raising the parabola up here andWhat does exit path still escapes now? Let's go the other way to the critical point here. [that's] point two fiveLet's see what happens there were we lowering the parabolaYou can already see what's happening the bottleneck here kind of gets squished together and at some point in timeYou know we get the parabola meeting the line and so what happens here?Is that the whole sequence kind of gets sucked into this point. Now Darth gets really excited at this point --Tractor BeamTractor beam all right now what happens next well. We're kind of going through this interval here to [the] next critical pointWhich is minus 0.75 lets us goOkay, so we're goingall the way down, and you can see tractor beams happening all the way along, soThings get sucked into this this point in attracting fixed point so attracting fixed point allThe way along here all the way along here, and actually not only along here is this real part of itBut it's happening everywhere here inside that main bulbthis cardioid, your main cardioid of the [Mandelbrot] set the same sort of behavior here things are being sucked into one point atminus0.75the Parabola intersects the [Green] [line] at exactly90 degrees andThings start splitting up and one attracting fixed point starts splitting up into two. So in this [dis] that's coming up hereAnd it's actually perfect [discs] around minus [one]The sequence is going to be attracted [by] two points oscillate between two points. Let's just see how [that] works [on]The way to minus one you see being attracted between two points at minus oneWe've got an extreme case happening where we flip between two points?[we're] not only attracted by two points but we flip between two and then well that same behavior you get insideThis circle here so basically two tractor beams kind of taking turn attracting things nowWe move into next circle here here things are going to start splitting up intofour different attracting pointsFor different attracting points there is another circle attached to that one and they were getting into eight differentattracting things andThen as another circle sixteen and thirty two and so on that continues forever wellNot forever all the way over here, [but] up to a point. [I'm] just going to drawRight there, and let's just go thereAnd if doubling up doubling up doubling up at that point in time thingsGet chaotic so chaotic and you kind of stay chaotic all the way to-2. Except [there] are islands of order, so let's justGo for a while these islands of order correspond to these many, Mandelbrot sets that he kind of come across hereLike on the way. We saw kind of one thing where the Chaos kind of goes into a -- whoo!we've got something nice happening here - something nice happening here period Three and actuallyWhen you have a really really really close look at this region kind of zoom in you'll also find thatThere's a lot of this nice doubling and regularityHappening whenever you come across one of those little Mandelbrot sets we're not going to go into detail [here]Let's just keep on going from here [to] -2. And let's see what happensHere's Chaos Chaos Chaos Chaos something interesting is about to happen PalmSo we're going down here over there up here, and then we're exploding to infinityThat's what happens at [minus] [two] or beyond [minus] [two] and so we escaping to infinity from then onReally nice picture, okay?So this this statement that the sequence is contained and when its containers in the Mandroid said that statement's actuallyHiding a lot of really really nice complicated behavior and that can [be] summarized nicely in a color picture like thissoYou know we choose one color to designate the region that has like one of those attracting fixed point one tractor beam?We have another one where I've got two tractor beams one for four tractor beams and then all kinds of other [stuff] hereSo all these bulbs that you see here have a characteristic behavior like everything in here has for example threeTractor beams lots of three tractor beams and the points are flipping back and forth between three different things just like in the mainbulb of thisbaby-Mandelbrot set that we saw before there's other nice behavior here, so it [isis] three four five or all the natural numbersCounting up here by the main bulbs that you see here. There's the odd numbers going thereYou can see lots of other stuff [in] fact. There's a lot of nice nice mathematics in here. So there's one guyThere's another guy in between there's the largest one. What's the number that Corresponds to that phone which is three plus four really nice?What about here [that] guy here? That's the largest one between those two guysit's just three plus five [is] eight andOther things that you see here, so I come to you see these antennas here one two three four things coming [out]We've got a four here here seven things coming outI've got a seven here there are three things coming out with one of three hereBut I think I'll leave that for another video is already too longokay, so at this point Darth is probably pretty disappointed andFigured out that well actually there is no real dark side to the Mandelbrot setSo we have to go and look for for that somewhere elseyou you
