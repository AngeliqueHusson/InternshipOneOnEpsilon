so let's start with some algebra sothere are nice simple equations like Xplus 1 equals 5 course it's not too hardto solve that equation we get x equals 4now this is an equation in whole numbersand we solved it in whole numbers prettysoon if you write down equations you getthings you can't solve in whole numbersif the equation had been X plus 6 equals5 there's no whole number solution to XI would need minus 1 for that so that'sx equals minus 1 so I need to introducenegative numbers to do that that's goodbut after all we might face an equationlike 2x plus 1 equals 0 so we need somefractions as well to keep go on solvingthese equations after a while you beginwondering why you didn't multiply X'stogether you get polynomial equations soa polynomial is something like aconstant times X to the n plus anothernumber times X to the n minus 1 plus blabla bla equations that I've got thingsto the power right there not evenequations they're really functions if Ihave a function f of X then I talk Icould solve an equation but an equationneeds an equal sign so f of x equals 0is an equation and I talk about asolution but if I have just a function fof X then I can talk about a root of thefunction that's the same thing as asolution so I have have the habit ofalternating between talking about rootsand and solutions so I don't want toconfuse anybody let's look at anequation if we had x squared minus 1equals 0 X could be plus 1 that's asolution but there's another solution 2xequals minus 1 if I have otherpolynomial equations though it's not soeasy to find solutions for instance asimple one would be x squared equals 2well there's no rational number thatsolves that equation that's somethingthe Greeks discovered they considered adeepphilosophical mystery but now of coursewe just write x equals square root of 2and there's another one if you believethat there's a square root of 2 then yousurely believe there's a minus squareroot of 2 so that's another solution soagain I have two solutions which ispretty nice so I could go on that wayunfortunately I quickly hit equationsthat don't have solutions in realnumbers something like x squared plus 1equals 0 has no real number solutionsbecause if I put in a real number X thisis always has a positive square and whenI add 1 it's even more positive so I cannever get 0 so this point is begin niceto begin graphing equations for instanceif f of X is x squared plus 1 and when Xis 0 I get the value of 1 so I put a 1there and when X is for example 1 thenthis would be 2 so I'd be up here when Xis 2 it's 4 so it's up here somewhereand everybody probably has seen this asa parabola so it doesn't have any rootsit doesn't have any any values of Xwhich make the value of f of X be 0 youcan see that from the picture because asolution would be a place where thegraph crossed the x-axis in other wordswhere Y was 0 this line is where yequals 0 so for a function to have aroot or an equation of a solution thegraph of the function has to cross thex-axis it's like an electric fence or amagic special magic law a magic lineright there is one kind of polynomialequation that always has a root in realnumbers and that's the case when F hasodd degree so every polynomial has adegree in this case it's in exponent onthe highest power if you have apolynomial odd degreewell this one was if even degree andthat turns out in some way to be why itdidn't have a root if let's take one ofodd degree if we took for instance thefunction f of x equals x well f of xequals x of course is of odd degree andthe graph of that is just a straightline that goes through the origin youcan see it has a solution when x equals0 but I could do fancythings I could say f of x equals x maybex squared times X minus 1 what does thatlook like well I can see from the way Iwrote it that f of x equals 0 has tworoots at x equals 1 and the other one isat x equals 0 and the graph is going tolook it turns out something like thisand I'll explain how I knew that in asecond but I see the root and I see thatthere's a really robust root there thisone I'll sort of almost missed if I'dmove down just a little bit it wouldn'thave been a root anymore for instance ifI put here minus 1 then this wholepicture would move down by one but itwould still have a root here and this isreally a robust picture somehow so thatthat's there's a theorem behind thatmathematicians love to write the wordtheorem especially when they can provewhat they're about to write anypolynomial and here I mean with realcoefficients of odd degree that's whatthe coefficients that are about to grazethe polynomial the polynomial has odddegree that's right begin something likeX to the fifth plus seven X to thefourth plus something else of odd degreehas at least one real root this oddexponent is going to be the key that'sright just from that I'm going to showyou that there's some X which when youput it in plug it in here it gives zeroas the answer that's pretty amazing thatyou can say that just from knowing thatlittle piece of the polynomial anywaythis is a proof that really explainssomething I think I'm going to graph thepolynomial you might ask me how can yougraph the polynomial if you don't knowanything about it but I'm going to do itanyway I'm going to assume that a ispositive just for the sake of argumentto make make one picture but there wouldbe an exactly corresponding picture of awere negative and I want to find a valueof X where Y is zero and of course thatmeans a place where the graph will crossthe x axis the x axis is really thegraph of y equals zero as that magicpoint on the y axis calledzero and we want to get there you I askwhy zero why not take y equals seven asyour goal and we could do that toexactly the same proof would do that tooI want to graph it well unfortunatelydon't even know where to start how can igraph a function that I know so littleabout but I do know one thing a positivenumber to an odd power is positive but anegative number to an odd power is anegative number and if I make theabsolute value of the number reallyreally big then I get a really reallybig number and if the number is positiveit's really really really positivenumber if it's negative it's reallyreally negative let's say a and B and Cand all the constants of this are prettysmallthey're bounded by something anyway andI take X to be a hundred times as big asthe biggest constant then X and let'ssay the exponents 5 just for the sake ofargument then X to the fifth power willbe a hundred times larger than X to thefourth power because I had I multipliedit on extra-time by X so this first termwill be enormous ly larger than anythingelse and in fact if i graph thisfunction you won't even see theinfluence of the other other terms onthe scale that I'm trying to draw herebasically this first term is going todominate it's going to be the mostimportant term and so I can at leastapproximate what I'm doingespecially when X is large just bythinking about the first term of coursewhen X is small all bets are off I can'tsay a thingbut when X is large I understand solet's take X large let's take X ahundred times larger than all the othercoefficients I'll just pretend it's ahundred for the sake of argument so bigX how big X X big and I'm going to sayabsolute x big and this is the way amathematician would write that absolutex much bigger than zero so minus 100plus 100 those are good candidates so ifX is big X is a hundred then X to thispositive power will be much bigger thanany of the other exponents and it'll beabout a hundred to the 2n plus onethat's a big numberI'm going to draw it up here and youhave to think that the y-axis is is areally different scale than the x axisthat point I can put in with someconfidence I don't know exactly where itis pretty close it's why it's way outthere right now if I take X to be minus100 then in for the same reason now Iget enormous absolute value for X to thefifth or X to the 2n plus 1 but 2 n plus1 is odd so I'll get an enormousnegative value so that was the firstpoint of the proof was that I can I cansay something about these way-out valuesthe second point of the proof and thereare only two is that a graph of afunction like this which is called acontinuous function can be drawn withoutlifting my pencil so I'm going to startdrawing I don't know where the graphreally goes but I'm going to draw as ifI did it goes somehow and when I get tothis point oh my gosh it has to crossthe x-axis to get up there well allright here we goit just crossed that's a root of theequation and it goes on somehow I don'thave any idea really where the root isit might be on the left it might be onthe right but in order to get from hereto here without lifting your pencil yousimply have to draw a line that crossesbut you can't walk from Mexico to Canadawithout going through the US right rightof course you could swim around and youor you maybe who could dig a tunnel andso we might have a little worried how dowe really know that there wasn't alittle tunnel just at that place maybethe real numbers just opened up like theRed Sea and let the red thing throughwell that's a really basic point aboutthe real numbers and it wasn'tcompletely understood until Dedekind Ithink in the nineteenth century but youhave to decide what you think the realnumbers are if I took the rationalnumbers for instance suppose I said Idon't know what the real numbers are butlet's do with the rational numbers andsaid this wouldn't have worked becausethere for example X cubed minus 2 has noreal rootsthat's an odd degree polynomial andthat's because this line would slipthrough the rational numbers wherethere's no rational number and evenadding square roots and cube rootswouldn't be enough you'd have to add alot of rootsthis work so how do we know there isn'ta hole there and this is one of thegreat ideas in mathematics that's due todebt again and it was a definition ofreal numbers in terms of rationalnumbers and it's so nice that I have totell you about it even though you mightalready be convinced that there's noholes in the real numbers so I'm goingto draw the rational numbers like thisthere are a lot of rational numbers butthey're also lots of holes as we've seenand then it can have the idea that whata real number really is is a way ofdividing the rational numbers into twoparts so here let's say this is going tobe a real numberhey and etic and said that what a reallyis is the set of rationals rationalnumbers less than a together with theset of rational numbers greater than aso these two sets tell where a is in thereal numbers and the reason there are noholes left is if there were a whole Iwould just find I would just define itto be the number which is the two setsall the numbers the rational numbersless than that number and all thenumbers greater than that number so I'vedefined holes out of existence this wayit's a really funny term really it's agreat trick this is saying thedefinition of David is the left side ofhis body plus the right side of his bodyit's worse than that it's saying that'sthe space on the left of me togetherwith a space on the right of me and ittells you just as little about me asthis tells you about the real numberthat's sitting there but it's a it's agood existence kind of proof or a reallyconstruction this is the sort of thingthat people study in maybe the junioryear course in mathematics or philosophyor philosophy as these are calledDedekind cuts and it's really importantidea in mathematicsI want to graph this function I want totell you what happens when I buy X and Iwant to find a point here which or atleast to convince you that there is apoint a blue point which will go to zeroon the red side
