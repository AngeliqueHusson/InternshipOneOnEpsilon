so I'm Louie Lyons I'm 14 years oldSanford Park in Ramallah and I'm inthird yearquantum random number generator forcryptographic applications my project isabout coming up with a random numberthat is truly random number that cannotbe guessed cannot be predicted cannot bedetermined so it uses radioactivityradioactivity is woven into the universethat radioactivity is random so Ithought well I'll use that to make anumber that's random and a number that'srandom may not seem very important itmay just seem I could come up with oneoff the top of my head but in essenceyou can't any computer can come up withany number that you can come up with sohow I went about it was I castradioactivity is in a number ofdifferent materials and what I used wasamericium which is in old smokedetectors I put it beside a Geigercounter so a Geiger counter measuresradioactivity and I was fed into mycomputer which ran a number of longmonths of processing and lots and lotsof work went into making all that numberor all that data into one number theresult in findings they were I ran themthrough a series of tests and thesetests say thus because computers aren'tperfect if you've got 95 percent you areright if you get 96 percent you areamazing when I put all my 10,000 pagesof numbers into the tests without 99percent which makes it the mostsophisticated random number of time themain use would be encryption so thesecurity of data persons data andindividuals information from financialmedical personal all that needs thisforever security if all computers havethis ability the future of computerswould be a lot brighteryou[Music]
