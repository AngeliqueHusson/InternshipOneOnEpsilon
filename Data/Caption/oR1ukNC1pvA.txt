so this lesson is to calculate theformula for developing the surface of arectangular prism as we look at arectangular prism there's a fewquestions we need to ask priordeveloping the formula question 1 howmany sides is this figure have question2 are reading these sides the same asanother question 3 what shape are theindividual sides in question 4 how doyou find the area of that type of shapeonce we look at question 1 how manysides is figure have well I have the topand the bottom or front in the back anda left and a right thus giving us atotal of 6 sides do any of these sidesor any sides the same as another wellthe top and bottom are the same in thefront in the back of the same and so arethe left and right so each pair eachside has its own matching side whatshape are these individual sides welleach side is consists of a rectangle andhow do you find the area of a rectangleall by simply multiplying one of itsdimensions by the other normally lengthtimes width as we look at these sixindividual sides there's no reason tocalculate all six of them because if weknow the bottom we know the top if weknew the front when you would know theback and if we knew the left we'd alsoknow the right so our purpose is to seeif we can just find the three of theseand then double that so let's start withthis bottom piece if I was trying tocalculate the area of this rectangle Iwould need to take the length times thewidth if I was trying to find the areaof this rectangle we would want lengthtimes height and if we wanted the areaof this rectangle we would take thewidth times the height now again thisonly gives us three the sides but if Iwanted the total area the first thingwe'd have to do is to take these threedifferent rectangles and we'd have toadd them togetherbut again this would only give us threedecides since the total surface areaconsists of six sides we'd have to takethis area and doublet that's giving usthe formula for the total surface areaof a rectangular prism as we look at ourformula very important that we have thecalculator calculate this formatcorrectly in other words if yourcalculator does order of operations youwould actually do just this lastcalculation part first where we neededto actually add these three areastogether prior to doubling it thereforeit is important that once you've addedyour three separate areas together thatyou push equals and then times toremember that surface area is alwayslabeled with square units this concludesthe surface area of a rectangular prism
