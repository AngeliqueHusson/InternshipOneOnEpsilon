Sara wanted to figure out if she didbetter on tests by studying two morehours or by sleeping two more hours shechartered she charted her results forten different tests so this is when shestudied two more hours and this is whenshe slept two more hours and they askedus based on the data should set shouldSara study more or sleep more the nightbefore a test and so this isn't a hugesample of data so we won't talk aboutthings like statistical significance andall of that but just based on theinformation we have let's see if we canhave any draw any at least initialconclusions so the first thing that wemight want to do is let's just comparestudying studying two hours more orsleeping two hours more and let's let'scalculate let's calculate somestatistics over here so let's let'sthink about her let's think about hermean test score when she's studyingversus when she studies two more hoursversus when she sleeps two more hours solet's think about the mean so the meanhere we're going to add up all of theseand then divide by five let me get acalculator out just for do these alittle bit quicker so the mean time whenshe's studying is going to be 93 plus 72plus 78 plus 82 plus 82 + 79 plus 79 andthen divide by five there's five datapoints here so her mean score when shestudies two hours more is 80 point eightso this is 80 point eight and what isthe mean score on her exams when shesleeps two hours more when she sleepstwo hours more so 85 plus 89 plus 81plus 95 plus 86 divided by five iseighty seven point two eighty sevenpoint two so just looking at that andshe has a higher average higher meantest score when she sleeps two hoursmoremaybe that's because sleep is moreimportant or maybe it's just she feltmore confident going into those exam soit felt like she doesn't need to studymuchbut that's at least a data point that'swhy this isn't really a good goodresearchwhenever the experimental subject is theones performing the the actual studythey kind of know what's going to happenmaybe they know that they have to theycan they don't have to study as much forthe exams that are easy or who knowswhat they are but let's just actuallycalculate the whole purpose of this isto actually just calculate the differentmean II mean median mode and all therest so let's just calculate now themedian let's calculate the median so tocalculate the median you want to put allof these in order and then pick out themiddle so if you want to put it in orderwhen she's studying I'll just write itover here you have the lowest is 72 thenyou have then after that you the nextlowest is 78 78 the next lowest is 79 79the next lowest is 82 82 and then youhave 93 93 so the median when shestudies two more hours is 79 and themedian when she sleeps two more hourslet's see so I'll put these in order thelowest here is 81 81 then we have 85 85then you have 86 86 then you have 89 89and then you have 95 so the median hereis going to be 86 86 so once again thismeasure of central tendency also saysthat it looks like she does better onexams when she sleeps two more hoursthen when she studies to Mars once againto me that doesn't conclusively say thatshe should study more or sleep more thatjust says that what for exams where shehappens to sleep more she happens to dobetter but it might go to it might bethe exams that she's more confident onshe's willing to study less and thensleep more or it might be that sleepingis actually what's helping her on theexam so we don't know but at least weknow that the median and the mean ishigher when she sleeps more now let'sthink about the mode what's the mostcommon so the mode so the mode is themost frequent result and when she'sstudying there is no single mostfrequent result if any of theseseventy-eight twice then that would havebeen the mode but they're all of thesescores are unique so there is no thereis no mode there is no mode for thestudying and the same thing is true forthe sleeping all of these are unique ifone of these showed up with a higherfrequency than the others then thatwould be the mode but there is nothingthat shows up more frequently thaneverything else now let's think aboutthe range and this essentially will tellus how spread apart are these valueswhat's the difference between thehighest and the lowest value so when thestudying the highest value is 93 lowestvalue is 22 the range sorry this is not22 this 72 right all right 70 this is a72 highest value is 93 lowest value is72 and so the range the range in thissituation is 93 minus 72 which is equalto 21 which is equal to 21 and then therange over here the range when shesleeps more is 95 minus 81 which isequal to 14 so this doesn't tell usanything about really the centraltendency but it does say that her scoreswhen she sleeps more tend to be lessspread around so 1 they tend to begenerally higher when we look at some oftheir central tendency measures and theyalso seem to be less spread about whenshe studies more her her average scoresor her median scores tend to be a littlebit lower and the range theirs lookslike there's more variety in how wellshe actually does there's a biggerdifference between her high score andher lowest score and then finally let'stry to do the mid range so the mid rangeis just the average of her highest andlowest scoresthen green mid range and it's anothermeasure kind of central tendencyso the mid range average of highest andlowest scores so mid range mid range isgoing to be 93 plus 72 divided by 2 sothis is what 165 165 over 2 which iseighty two point five eighty two pointfive at least in this example wasn't toofar away from the mean or the median andthen the mid range when she sleeps moreis going to beso the mid-range is going to be 95 plus81 95 plus 81 over 2 so this is equal to176 over 2 and that is what that is 88that is is that right yep 80 times 2 is160 then you have another 16 so that is88 88 so I don't know if you could basedon this datatell Sarah that she could definitelystudy more sleep more I guess they'reprobably saying oh once you look at thisit looks like she does better when she'swhen she sleeps more but that by itselfyou don't know if she's sleeping more ifthe sleep is causing so you don't knowif the sleep is causing her to do betterso that's one theory and I think that'swhat the writer of this question wasthinking that some you know that this isenough to make a conclusion but you alsodon't know maybe the maybe she thesubjects that she knows better she'swilling to study less she's willing tostudy less and sleep more so youactually don't know which way it goes isa is is or is because you have an easyexam the next night you're willing tosleep more and that's why we get theseresults or maybe it is really true thatthe sleeping more actually makes someoneperform better even when the exams arethe same level of difficulty
