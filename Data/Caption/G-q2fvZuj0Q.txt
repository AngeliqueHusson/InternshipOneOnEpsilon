I want to show you an expression thatcontains a complex fraction thisexpression right here notice that here'sa fraction with a fraction in itsdenominator so this is a complexfraction this expression over here iscalled a continued fraction because itcontinues on in the same manner that itstarts right here forever so you can seethey look pretty similar but thispresents a problem for us because howare we going to get down to the bottomof this thing to work our way back up todo the addition when I look at thisexpression right here it might look alittle complicated but I know I canstart here with 1 plus 1 is 2 then Ihave 1 plus 1/2 that's knit not too badthe reciprocal of that whatever I getI'll add it to 1 so I know what to doright here but in this case this goes onforever in this direction I can't go tothe bottom of this and work my way backup so there is a way to get an idea ofwhere this thing is going as these dotsshow that we go on forever in thatdirection so I'm going to come back I'mgoing to draw a couple things on theboard come back here and then we'll seewhat we can do with this expression I'llbe right back ok so I've taken thisexpression right here and written thesesmaller expressions to get an idea whatit looks like as I continue down thispath right here so I can see here thisproblem is pretty simple to work I'lljust start down here and add 1 and 1 andget 2 so this is the same as 1 plus 1/2well 1 is 2 halves plus 1/2 that's 3halvesok so I could see that that's prettyeasy to do now I want to simplify thisexpression well when I look at it I have1 plus 1 over 1 plus 1 well that's thisright here you see this expression righthere appears in this expression so Iknow that this is 3 halves which meansthat I can simplify my work a little bit1 plus 1 over 3 halveswell dividing by 3 halves is the same asmultiplying by 2/3 or I can just say thereciprocal of 3 halves in any case thatcomes out to be 2/3 1 plus 2/3 so now Ihave 3/3 plus 2that will give me 5/3 and so I look atthis expression here that I've justsimplified and I see that it's thisexpression right here 1 plus 1 over 1plus 1 over 1 plus 1 1 plus 1 over 1plus 1 over 1 plus 1 so this expressionright here is the same as thisexpression which means it must be equalto 5/3 so that means I have 1 plus 1over 5/3 so same kind of lookingexpression there's this but now I have5/3 instead of 3 halveswell the reciprocal of 5/3 is 3/5 so 1plus 3/5 and then I have five fifthsplus 3/5 is equal to 8/5 now I don'tknow are these numbers here lookingfamiliar to you let's go down one moreline right here it'll be one plus oneover one plus one over one plus one overlet's see I've got one two three one twothree one plus one over one plus onediscounted the number of fraction bars Ihave so one two three one two three fourwell this expression right here againshows up as this expression so it mustbe equal to 8/5 so I have one plus oneover eight fifths and that's one plusfive eight and eight eight plus fiveeight is thirteen eight now I'm going toask you again does this look like it'sfamiliar to youwell let's look back through theFibonacci sequence 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21dot-dot-dot and you can see that 3halves is the ratio of these twoFibonacci numbers 5/3 the ratio of thenext to 8/5 the ratio of the next two13:8 the ratio of the next two I don'teven have to write all this out whateverthat one is I know thatnext number in the sequence is going tobe 21 over 13 so it turns out thatsimplified this complex fraction righthere as we start making this littlesequence of numbers they turn out to beFibonacci numbers and each one of theseexpressions in this series ofexpressions turns out to be the ratio oftwo consecutive Fibonacci numbers so ifwe knew where this ratio was going wewould know what the answer to thisquestion is right here what is therewhat what is this when we simplify itcompletely well it's whatever we getwhen we go down this sequence foreverand just keep going turns out that itdoes actually go towards a very specialnumber called the golden ratio we need alittle bit more work with square rootsto show that but we'll do that later onin the course for right now all I wantyou to see is that this is a sequence ofratios of consecutive Fibonacci numbersand it gives us a way to start thesimplification process which with thisexpression right here which seemedimpossible the first time we saw it
