let's look at two more examples ofconverting nonterminating recurringdecimals to the rational number form Pby Q here's our first example 0.35 2with a bar over 3 5 2 as we learnt inthe last video we equate this to avariable so we can say that x equalszero point 3 5 2 3 5 2 3 5 2 and so onlet this be our first equation toconvert this to the P by Q form we needto eliminate the recurring part which isthis part the only way to do that is tohave two equations with the recurringpart on the right-hand side of thedecimal point if we multiply thisequation by 10 we will get 10 X equal to3 point 5 2 3 5 2 3 5 2 and so on itwon't work because we have differentnumbers on the right-hand side of thedecimal pointwhat if they multiply the equation by100 we will get 100 X equal to 35 point2 3 5 2 3 5 2 and so onagain the digits after the decimal pointdo not match so let's multiply bothsides of the equation by 1000 we get1000 x equals 3 fifty two point threefive two three five two three five twoand so on now the digits after thedecimal points match let's make this ussecond equation if we subtract thisequation from this one we will be ableto eliminate the recurring partsubtracting equation 1 from Equation 2we get 999 X on the left hand side andsubtracting this from this we get 352 soX will equal 352 by 999 which is in theP by Q form now let's take an example ofa mixed recurring decimal 0.23 9/4 witha bar over 9 forspot is not recurring while this partgoes on forever first things first let'sequate it to X x equals zero point twothree nine four nine four nine four andso on we need two equations with arecurring decimal part at present wehave none we need to get 23 here to havejust the recurring part on the rightside of the decimalhence we multiply this equation by 100and get 100 x equals 23 point nine fournine four nine four nine four and so onso we got the recurring part on theright side of the decimal so let's callthis our first equation here's theinteresting part how do we get anotherequation with the recurring part on theright side of the decimal yes wemultiply this equation by 100 so 10,000X will equal to three nine four pointnine four nine four nine four and so onlet this be our second equation now weare ready we have two equations with thesame recurring part we could have gotthis equation by multiplying thisequation with ten thousand two it's thesame thing but remember our only aim isto have two equations with the samerecurring part here now it's simple wecan just subtract the first equationfrom the second one and find the valueof x the left-hand side would equal10,000 X minus 100x and the right-handside would equal to three nine fourpoint nine four nine four nine four andso on - twenty three point nine fournine four nine four and so on theleft-hand side would equal nine thousandnine hundred X since the decimal part isthe same the right hand side would equalto three nine four minus twenty threewhich equals two three seven oneso x equals two three seven one by ninethousand nine hundred Wow all this takestime what if there's a method by waywe can write the answer directly in verylittle time yes you will be surprised inthe next part of the video we will seehow we could arrive at an answer inmatter of seconds until then keeppracticing hardyou
