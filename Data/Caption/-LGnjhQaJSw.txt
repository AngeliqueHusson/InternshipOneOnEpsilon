all right in this video I'm going to doanother example of solving just a basicrational equation and again what I'mgoing to do is I'm going to use thesecond technique here where I'm going toput I'm going to write both sides as asingle fraction cross multiply and thenit's going to turn into just a verybasic linear equation that we'll be ableto solve from there okay so in this onewe've got negative x over X plus 5 minus5 equals x over X plus 5 so I could youknow straight away try to write the leftside I could I can get commondenominators of X plus 5 but in thiscase since I noticed that there'salready you know the right side alreadyhas a denominator of X plus 5 I thinkwhat I'm going to do in this case issimply move the first term over to theother side and again things separated bypluses or minuses or separate terms soI'm going to have to sort of pick upthis whole first term and move it overto the other side since it's a negativex over X plus 5 what I'm going to do isadd X over X plus 5 to both sidesso on the left side the idea is you havethe negative x over X plus five at apositive x over X plus five those justcancel out we're left with the negativefive on the left side and on the rightside now we have x over X plus five andnow we have an extra x over X plus fivebecause we just move the other one overso notice that all that really happenedto get if things are separated by plusesor minuses to me the idea is you canbasically just stick it on the otherside just change the sign in front of itit was originally a negative well nowit's a positive okay so now on the rightside while I say hey I've got commondenominators which means I can writethis as a single fraction if I take oneX plus one X in the numerator I'll gettwo X again we just leave ourdenominator alone and again now I'mgoing to do the same thing as in some ofthe other videos is I'm just going tocross multiply so we can think aboutnegative five as being negative fiveover one so again we have to be a littlecareful here because I think we're goingto have to distribute some things outokay so it says we're going to havenegative five when you multiply by Xplus five make sure you put that inparenthesis because you're going to haveto distribute the negative five out onthe right side I'm going to have 1 times2x which is just 2x and now I'm back toa familiar linear equation so the firstthing I'll have to do is distribute outthe negative 5 so here you couldn't evendivide both sides by negative 5 but if Idivide both sides by negative 5 I end upwith fractions immediately and you knowI try to avoid fractions if possible soit just makes the arithmetic easier soI'll take negative 5 times X I'll takenegative 5 times positive 5 which willbe negative 25 2x again is just hang itout on the right side and again I'mtrying to put all my X's on the sameside so what I'm going to do is I'm justgoing to add 2x excuse me I'm going toadd 5x to both sides and that will kindof break everything up it'll put it'llleave me with just the negative 25 onthe left side and then if I take 2x plus5x on the right side that's going toleave me with a positive 7x so now we'realmost there we have negative 25 equals7x again I'm trying to get X by itselfsince I'm multiplying by 7 I'm simplygoing to divide both sides by 7 and I'llget x equals negative 25 over 7 Iusually ask myself does that reduce andin this case it doesn't so we've got ouranswered again you should check thatthis is actually a solution to thisrational equation but you can't do thearithmetic and verify in fact that it isa solution so alright I hope thisexample makes some sense and helps youout
