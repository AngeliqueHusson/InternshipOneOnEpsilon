welcome in a 9th grade 10th gradegeometry class we often give kidsformulas and just tell them here it isbelieve it we can't prove it requirescackles to prove it but let's just playwith it nonetheless and shove in numbersall the rest I have found it verysatisfying I'd like to give stu's theopportunity to understand reform doescome from and one of them is the form ofthe volume of a sphere so we often tellthem the volume of a sphere of radius Rso here's a sphere radius our volume is4/3 PI R cubed and this just comes outcold and not very exciting what I'd liketo do here is take all the hard workwe've done of a previous video I'mlooking at the volume of a cone and useit to show how Archimedes derived thisformula 4/3 PI R cubed before theemission of cactus obviously is usingthe ideas of calculus without directlymentioning it back thenit's a hurry up here we go whatArchimedes did after I'm sure much muchthought and how they can struggle hesaid let's just enclose the top half ofthe sphere in a cone in a sorry in acylinder or missing so we'll just focuson the top half so there it is there's acylinder of radius R againand obviously the height of the cylinderis going all the way up another waysthis fiercest fighters are and henoticed something remarkable about thespace outside the top of the sphereinside that cylinder what he did he saidokay just like Kevin Larry's princefought in the previous video let's lookat Majan this is like stacks of paperbut I remember he's looking at theoutside part which is very confusing soif you have for me to draw an attempt todo it for they at a particular height Xthe slice at height X of the current ofthe cylinder is if circle of radius Rwhereas the slice of the sphere at thatheight would be a circle of small radiusso that means the space outside the oneI'm interested in will be a little ringbetween these two circles so you knowsomething about the area that ringingactually calculator that isn't he saidif we went up X inches we could work outthe area that green ring you noticethere was radius all the way out to herefor the inner circlestill radius-r still part of the spherewhich means he could work at a forum forthe radius of that smaller circle byPythagoras must be the square root of asquared minus x squared and the outerring is still a circle of radius Rthat's all the way out R so it means thearea of this green ring it would be thebig circle area the big circle minus thearea of the small circle how I itsradius squared well he goes squaring asquare root gives me back to just asquared minus x squared and then someout of the PI R Squared's cancel mygiven PI x squared and you thought thatis actually fabulous because he had anepiphany that he drew the same cylinderI'll draw it over here same radius oursame height R and in it drew the linethe diagonal line y equals x isperfectly diagonal and in fact it onboth sides to make a cone he nursed ifyou can went up X inches for this conewell since there's a perfect day of myli-- it's also X inches out that meansthis slice at height X is also a circleof radius X and so also his area PI xsquared now from the previous video oncurrents we did look at Carol Larry'sprinciple we said that we had stacks asa paper such that each height each stackeach piece of paper had the same areathan the volumes of the to read currentsmust be the same we've got that going onhere we've got the space stack thescreen rim is actually the same area asthis cone so if I stacked up all thespace pieces like this we get basicallyjust proved that the area the volume ofthe space on the Left picture must equalthe volume of the cone on this picturebut I know the formulas occurring fromthe previous video we know it's 1/3 thearea of its space PI R squared is stillradius R times its height which is R soit's 1/3 PI R cubed so we have nowdeduced that the volume of the spaceoutside there's at least the top of thesphere is 1/3 picubed well we're all set now things havefallen into place what I'd like now isthe volume of the actual sphere well sofar we focus on the top half of thesphere so right now we can say the veryleast the volume at least in the tophalf the sphere so the volume at harvestsevere would be the volume of the wholecylinder minus the volume of the spacewas the volume of the whole cylinderwell that's PI R squared tons of ourareas base times height minus the volumeof the space which we just calculate onethird PI R cubed wellPI R cubed minus 1/3 PI R cubed is 2/3PI R cubed so the bottom of the cylindertake away the bottom of the space leavesme the volume of the top half the spheregreat but I want the volume of the wholesphere so the fine with the whole spheremust be double that 4/3 PI R cubed thereit isthere is the formula for the volume of asphere of radius R thanks
