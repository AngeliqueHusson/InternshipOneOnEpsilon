g'day and welcome to the tech mathchannel what we're going to be having alook at in today's video is a way ofworking out the greatest common factor areally fast way of doing it for twonumbers he could use it for more numberswe'll go for two numbers for this videookay so so the two numbers we werelooking at were 60 and 72 the way thatwe'd do this really really quicklyreally fast as follows now first off youlook at two numbers are going to thisokay so you might look and go hey twogoes into this so I'm just going to puta two here and I'm going to see how manytimes the two goes into these numbersokay so two goes into 60 30 times and itgoes into 72 36 times okay next thing wedo is we say okay so is there any numberthat goes into both of these oh yeah- does once again so he goes into thisone 15 times and it goes into this one18 times okay is there any number thatgoes into both of these all right threedoes three goes into this one five timesand it goes into this one six times nowis there any number that goes into bothof these oh you can say yeah one doesbut one won't reduce the number anymoreso we've hit this stage with these wehave a couple of our numbers here wherethey know they can't be reduced any moreso we look at these three numbers the 2the 2 and the 3 and we multiply thesetogether to get that greatest commonfactor 2 times 2 is 4 times 3 ourgreatest common factor is 12 pretty easyright okay let's have a look at anotherone of these okay so say we want to workout the greatest common factor let'shave a look at what about 72 and 108okay you might even give this a go soyou could look at this straightaway andyou could possibly recognize that ninegoes into both of these okay so youcould be like okay nine goes into thisone okay nine a 272 and twelve timesnine is 109 okay so that's our firstnumber we've got the next ones is thereany number that goes into both of theseyet okay four does four goes in to thisone two times and it goes into this onethree times and is there any numbersthat go into both of they say there'snot so we multiply these two numbersthrough nine times four highest Ihighest common factor is 36 anyway don'tactually think of that video I hope youliked it it's a fairly quick and easyway of doing this without getting intomessy factor trees always find myselfrunning into and getting squashed up ofI use e so I find this a lot neatereasier method of doing this anyway thankyou for watching we'll see you next timebye
