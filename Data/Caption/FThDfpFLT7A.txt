in this video I'm going to show you howto convert recurring decimals intofractions so going to start off with avery simple one going to start off withnot 0.7 recurring remember this dot uphere means that that seven actually goeson forever so that's the same as naughtpoint seven seven seven and sevenactually go on forever and ever theynever stop now if you look at thisdecimal it's just one digit that'srecurring it's a seven the seven isgoing on forever so to convert thisrecurring decimal into a fractionwrite down your seven that's the topnumber on the fraction that's thenumerator on the bottom of the fractionsyou always put nines and if it's onedigit that's recurring you put one nineit's always nine on the bottom let's saythese recurring decimals work and sevenninths is the same it's not point sevenif you've got a calculator well on thecalculator you could do 7/9 and you'llsee that you get seven ninths as afraction and as a decimal not pointseven recurring they're all the samething so we've got one there naughtpoint seven it's the same seven ninthsif we look at another onewe look at naught point threereoccurring now you may already knowwhat that one is is a fraction wellfollowing the system we've done up hereit's one digit that's recurring it'sjust a three that's recurring so we'llwrite that down and because it's justone digit that's recurring we write onenine on the bottom so naught point threeor recurring it's the same as three 9sthree over nine and you might beexpecting one third well let's have alook three over nine 3 goes into both ofthose numbers 3 goes into 3 3 goes into9 it's going to put that 3 down there ina circle I'm going to divide both ofthese by this number down here by 3 3divided by 3 is 1 9 divided by 3 is 3 sonot point three recurring is the same asone-third if we look at another one notpoint six three recurring if the dotsare like this this means that thatnumber is not point sixthree six three six three six three andso are the six ins and the threes as apair go on forever so you'll write the 6and the 3 down on the top of a fractionthat's a numerator and on the bottom wewrite 9 down twice to get 99 we'vewritten known 9 down twice because thereare two digits on the top so naughtpoint six three are occurring it's thesame as 63 over 99now hopefully you can spot that both ofthese numbers have a common factor anumber that goes into them both and 9goes into both of those numbers 9 goesinto 63 7 times 9 goes into 99 11 timesso that's the same 7-elevens and againif you go for a calculator I mean put ina calculator 7/11 some of thesecalculators these things will give it toyou as a fraction first then on acalculator like this if you press thisSD button down here that will thenchange it into a decimal and you've gotno point 6-3 6-3 6-3 so we've done a twodigit recurring decimal so what we'regoing to look at next is a three digitrecurring decimal you probably guesswhat will happen this is not point twonot one and I'm going to put the dotsthere and there that shows that thepattern recurs between the 2 and the 1so that's the same as naught point 201201 201 going on and on forever youprobably guess what we do we write downthe 201 on the top is a numerator of ourfraction and on the bottom we write 1 23 three nines to get 201 over 999 nowyou may be at a spot 3 goes into both ofthose 3 goes into this nut MCUs 3 goesinto the nines 3 also goes into 201 justas an aside you can check that because 2naught and 1 and up to 3 3 goes into 3 3will go into 201 as you do cancel thatdown dividing them both by 3you'll get 67 over 3hundred and thirty three and that's whatnaught point zero one is as a recurringdecimal sometimes you can get themslightly harder if we look at this nextone nor point naught for recurring whenthe dose is over the four but not thisfirst zero that means my number isnaught point naught and then the foursstart going on well if you get one likethis think of it like this not pointnaught for recurring that's the same asnaught point for recurring divided by 10if I'd move this decimal point here tomake this number naught point four wellthis number here is bigger than thatonce I've got to divide it by 10 sonaught point naught for recurring isnaught point for recurring divided by 10this is 4 over 9 and I've got to dividethat by 10 if you're dividing a fractionby 10 all you need to do is put a naughton the bottom so that becomes 4 over 94over 90 you could cancel down is 2 over45 so that's how to do one where not allof it is recurring we will look atanother one of those the next one we'lllook at will have a look now at naughtpoint naught naught 4/5 recurring we'rejust two four and the five are recurringso that's the same as you get rid ofthese noughts at the beginning it's thesame as more point four five recurringdivided by 105 divided by 100 becausethere are two notes here in thebeginning before the recurring bit so Iput two notes here 45 as a recurring bitup there will be 45 over 99 and I got todivide that by 100 so if you're dividinga fraction by 100 you just need to puttwo notes on the bottom after whatyou've already gotso I get 45 over 9900 hopefully you canspotwaves going to both of these numbers soif I divide them both by 5 I get 9 andthat one is 1980 and then you may be ata spot that nines go into both of thoseagain as a check hereone at nine at 8 and 0 is 18 9 goes into18 so inlined guaranteed to go into thatone and if you do council that one downby 9 9 goes into 9 once in 9 goes into1980 220 times if we look at one furtherexample if you had something like naughtpoint three seven recurring I show youthat one not point three seven we'reoccurring we're just a seven isrecurring right that is your normalnaught point three plus naught pointnaught seven recurring you've got tomake sure that this seven recurring isin the second decimal place well thishere naught point three you know that'sso I asked not a recurring one it gotthat wrong nor point three that's thesame as three tenths over here there'snaught point naught seven recurringthat's the same as naught point sevenrecurring divided by ten using what wedid earlier on naught point sevenrecurring is seven ninths I have todivide that by 10 then mustn't forgetthree tenths at the beginning for thenaught point three seven lights dividedby 10 is 7 over 90 using the same methodas earlier and over here I've got mythree tenths I no need to add thesefractions together I'm adding thesetogetherwhichever way you use I'm going to putit over the nernst common denominatorwhich is 93 tenths four times the bottomnumber by nine on user times the topnumber by nine so that's the same as 27over 90 and my seven over 90 add thosetogether I will get 34 over 19 if I thencancel that down twos go into both ofthose numbers I get 17 and 45 so I'vegone from my starting number which wasnaught point three seven recurI've got that don't to be seventeen over45 and again if you're doing acalculator paper you can do that checkif I do 17 divided by 45 calculator willgive me as a decimal naught point threeand then the sevens recur so I know I'vegot that question right so let's go backto see what I'm working out we've donethere you can cope with that questionyou can cope with changing any recurringdecimal into a fraction
