all right in this video I'm going to doa few examples involving the remaindertheorem and basically all the remaindertheorem says if you've got somepolynomial f of X and you're dividing itby a linear factor that looks like Xminus a it says if you do all that longdivision or synthetic division and youfind the remainder it says it's going tobe the same thing as if you'd plugged ainto the original function okay so a fewexamples here I'm even going to see if Ican squeeze three of them in here so inthe first one notice we've got a 3xcubed minus 2x squared plus X minus 6that's our f of X that's being dividedin this case we're dividing by X minus 4so it says this number that's going tobe our a value whatever you'resubtracting so it says if we have thefunction f of X equals 3x cubed minus 2xsquared plus X minus 6 if you want tofind the remainder when you divide by Xminus 4 it says just plug 4 in so we get3 times 4 cubed minus 2 times 4 squaredplus 4 minus 6 let's see 4 cubed is a 644 squared is 16 times a negative 2 willbe 32 positive 4 negative 6 is negative2 let's see 3 times 64 that would be 180and 12 so that would be 192 minus 32minus to 192 minus 32 would be 160 minus2 would be 158 so it says the remainderin this case when you do the longdivision would simply be the value 158okay let's maybe do one other one inthis one real quick and then we'll dothe third example here in a separatevideo so again notice we've got negative4x cubed plus 8x squared plus 12x plus16 we're dividing by X plus 2 notice wecould write the denominator as X minusnegative- so again you're kind of a the numberyou're plugging in again like in thefirst example I saw a negative forbutton but I plug in positive for here Isee a positive - but I'm actually goingto plug negative 2 into the function inthe numerator so if our function againis the top part if we let f of X benegative 4x cubed plus 8x squared plus12x plus 16 it says if we plug innegative 2 well we'll just get negative4 times negative 2 cubed plus 8 timesnegative 2 squared plus 12 timesnegative 2 plus 16 okay so let's see ifwe can do this negative 2 cubed negative8 times negative 4 is 32 negative 2squares 4 times 8 is another 32 12negative 2 is negative 24 plus 16hanging out let's see 30 - 32 is 64minus 24 is 40 and another 16 I'mgetting positive 56 as the remainder inthis case mmm Oh what the heck let's goahead and do the last one it doesn'tlook too terrible notice we've got X tothe sixth plus 5x to the excuse me X tothe 6 plus 4x to the fifth plus 9 Xcubed minus 4x squared plus 10 dividedby X plus 1 so again I could write thisas X minus negative 1 that's going to bemy a value that I'm plugging in andagain we're simply plugging it into thisfunction okay so this is my f of X I'mnot going to write it all out but F ofnegative 1 it says we would get negative1 to the 6th plus 4 times negative 1- v nine times negative one cubed minusfour times negative one squared plus 10if you take a negative to an even powernegative one to an even power it'spositive one if you raise it to an oddpower it's negative one so we'll getnegative four here minus nine this willturn into positive one times negative 4which is negative four plus ten okaylet's see negative 4 and negative 4 isnegative eight negative 9 is negative 17plus 10 would be negative seven plusanother one I'm getting negative sixhere if all my arithmetic is correct soit looks like in this very last exampleif we do our long division we'll simplyget a remainder of negative six after wedo the arithmetic
