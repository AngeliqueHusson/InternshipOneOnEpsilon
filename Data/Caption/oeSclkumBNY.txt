in your math class something calledcross multiplying right so when you havea ratio equal to a ratio that's calledthe proportion and the way that youwould solve it is you would multiply inthe diagonal and that is equal to theproduct of the other diagonal multipliedtogether so for example on this setuphere we would have a times D equals Btimes C okay so basically that's ID ofyour cross multiplying across that equalsign now just want to make a note sowe've learned that as cross multiplyingbut another name for this way of solvingequations it's called the means extremesproperty and basically what that meansextremes property tells us is that themeans which are these ones here I guessyou could think of it as being in themiddle writes the ABCD so that meansokaythe product of the means is equal to theproduct of the extremes those are theones here on the outside so an examplewould be like say for example we setthis up we want to find the geometricmean of 9 and 16 we can put our variableX here in the mean position okay thatmeans positions and then we're gonna putour 9 and 16 over here in the extremesposition and then all we have to do nowis just cross multiply and solve for xand that's our geometric mean so x timesX is x squared 9 times 16 is 144 andthen if we take the square root of bothsides you can see that X is coming outto 12 so that's our geometric mean soanother example would be like say forexample if you had 4 and 9 so let's seeif we can do that one so same idea we'vegot our means here these are means thatour extremes here we're going to put 4and 9 or 2 numbers that were interestedin working with and we're going to crossmultiply so you can see that's going tobe x squared equals 4 times 9 which is36 and if you take the square root ofboth sides you can see that X is comingout to 6 now you might be thinking toyourself well isn't there a simple wayto do this and you're exactly right whatyou can do is you just take the twonumbers together let's just say that thetwo numbers are called a and B so youcan see when you're cross multiplying wealways end up getting x squared rightand the product of the two numbers we'lljust say that's a and B okay thosegetting multiplied together and if wetake the square root of both sides youcan see that X is equal to the squareroot of a times B right so if you wantjust a quick way of doing it all you dois just multiply the two numberstogether take the square root and that'syour geometric mean now if you'reinterested in learning about thegeometric mean as it applies to righttriangles when you drop an altitude youend up getting three similar trianglesand there's something called the leggeometric mean theorem and the altitudegeometric mean theorem I'll have linksfor those if you want to check thosevideos out otherwise this wraps up thisvideos if you liked it subscribe to thechannel check out more math tutoringvideos on my youtube channelmario's math tutoring and I look forwardto helping you in the future videos I'lltalk to you soon
