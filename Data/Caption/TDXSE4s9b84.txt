hi this is Mario with Mario's mathtutoring coming to with another mathvideo to help you boost your score inyour math class improve yourunderstanding and hopefully make mathmore fun and less stressful so in thisvideo let's get right into it we want tofind the volume of pyramids and conesright so what's the formula it's volumeequals 1/3 the area of the base timesthe height so when you see that capitalB it means the area of the bottom timesthe height now you don't want to getconfused when you do surface area you'reusing the slant height you can if youuse the letter L for the slant heightthat's the angled height or the leaningheight here we want the perpendicularheight the perpendicular distance fromthe center of the base to the vertexhere that's the overall height okay samething with the cone we're going from thecenter of the base ok perpendicular tothe the vertex right there ok so let'sgo ahead and do this example of thepyramid now one thing I wanted to showyou is that if you put this pyramid okayin a box okay like this okay can youvisualize this here if you put it in abox this pyramid would only take up 1/3of the volume of that box so if thebases were the same the height was thesame because of the pyramid is like youknow on a diagonal it's an angle up okaylike this you could actually fit twomore of these pyramids in there grantedyou have to cut them up or you knowdivide them up somehow so that theywould you know fit in all those emptyspaces there so this is only taking up1/3 that's where you can see the thirdscoming from there but let's go ahead anddo this so it's volume equals 1/3 okarea of the base now the base here youcan see is a square so it's going to be8 times 8 so that's 64 times the overallheight so we don't want this height heresometimes I'll give you this okay wedon't want that when we want 10 and sothere you go so it's 1/3 times 64 times10 that's gonna give your volume andthat's going to be in units cubed ok thenext one is a cone okay so I'll coneit's the exact same formula I like tokind of group my formulas together likethis so there's less to memorize and youmight want to do the same thing too socones and pyramids kind of have the sameshape right just a different kind of a Bso you just have to think okay this is acircle what's the area of a circle pir-squared okay so that's the base rightthere times the height and we want thisperpendicular height not the slantheightokay the radius is five so we have pitimes five squared so that's pi times 25times one-third times the height whichis 10 so if you multiply all thattogether that's going to give yourvolume in units cubed now just a quicknote sometimes students get a little bityou know tripped up on the fractions youcan think of any whole number as afraction by putting it over one so youwould multiply all the numerators allthe denominators and then you woulddivide so in this case that's 25 times10 is 250 times pi so that's 250 PI ifwe want an exact answer if you want toround an answer just use a 3.14 for piand then three times one times one timesone is three and there you go that's anexact answer but again you could make pi3.14 divided get a decimal and round butthis is the exact so I hope you'reenjoying the videos go ahead andsubscribe to the channel check out someof my past videos I've got more likethese coming and if you have somecomments about ways I can make thesevideos better or how they're helping youI'd really appreciate that knowing thatput it in the comment section below andI'll see you in the future videos I'lltalk to you soon
