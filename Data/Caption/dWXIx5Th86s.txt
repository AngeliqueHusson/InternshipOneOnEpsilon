one application of the Pythagoreantheorem is a space diagonal which is nota right at Disneylanda space diagonal is the diagonal thatpasses through space between verticesnot along the bases or the lateral facesso what that means is that if you have abox here the space diagonal will go fromone vertexthrough the middle of that box all theway to its opposite corner so there'sgonna be four of these and I'll draw inone of them let's say we started at thisvertex right here which is in the upperleft the space diagonal will go all theway down to this lower right vertex soif I drew that in it's gonna looksomething like that so in order tocalculate the length of this spacediagonal you're gonna use thePythagorean theorem and you're going todraw in a diagonal along the base ofthis face so if you know that this is aright angle which it will be becausethese problems will only apply torectangular prisms then you can find onelike find the other leg and then use thePythagorean theorem a squared plus Bsquared equals C squared to find thelength of your space diagonal so there'sthree other ones and that would extendfrom this vertex to the one in the frontleft and you could have one from thisback left extending to the front rightand finally from this back rightextending to the front left so the keyto the problems with space diagonals isremembering that you can apply thePythagorean theorem usually you're goingto have to apply it more than once
