today welcome to the tech math channelwhat we're going to be having that inthis video is ways of working out theleast common multiple okay and that isthe least common multiple quite oftencalled the LCM short or the lowestcommon multiple it's the smallest commonnumber that a set of numbers will gointo evenly so an example say we werelooking for the lowest common multipleof 3 & 4 we'd be looking for the lowestnumber that both 3 & 4 go into okay soand there's some different ways ofworking this out we're going to startwith the most simple ways and we'regoing to move up to some ways you canwork it out for some fairly trickynumbers okay so sit back enjoy by theway the lowest our least common multiplefor 3 & 4 is 12I'll tell you why call multiple so thatnumbers that 3 goes into + 3 6 9 12 15and I keep going for we got 4 8 12 16 20and we're looking for the lowest numberthat both of these numbers go into so 12okay 12 goes 3 goes into 12 4 times and4 goes into 12 3 times so this is whatthat least common multiple is but we'regenerally not going to do this like thisI mean this is a nice simple way if youknow your times tables well you might beable to do that straight away and dothis sort of method but I'm going toshow you some other ways of doing thisso we're going to look at right now inthis video is how to look at the lowestcommon multiple the least commonmultiple of some easier numbers similarnumbers you know that you'll have a fairguard doing and you probably won't maketoo many state mistakes in it the nextvideo I'm going to be looking at how towork it out for some fairly diabolicalexamples okay so I you don't know that'ssomething to look forward to now whatwe're going to be having look at forinstance now is how do we have the leastCole model the lowest common multiplefor say 60 and 72 so I'm going to gothrough a few examples now the way thatthe method I'm going to show you doingthisthat's a fairly simple method and it's arevision method what we do is we lookfor a number that goes into both ofthese okay so a number that goes intoboth 60 and 72 a common number is say 6ok 6 goes into 60 10 times I can't tojot that down here actually I've jotdown the 10 here and 6 goes into 72 12times so now we look at our 10 and 12 wethink is there another number that goesinto both 10 and 12 okay that we canreduce this further and there is okay wecan reduce by dividing by the number 2okay you'll see that 2 goes into 10 fivetimes and it goes into 12 6 times now isthere enough can we reduce this anyfurther this file and the 6 is there anumber that goes into both of these wellthere's a number that goes into it 1 butit doesn't reduce it so we can't reduceanymore so what we do is we multiplythese numbers here all together to getour least common multiple ok so thenumbers that we divided by and also thenumbers that were left at the end okayso 6 times 2 is 12 times 5 is 60 timessixth we get our least common multiplewhich is 360 is our LCM so did you getthat they look really really importantthat you do reduce these numbers as lowas possible and that's where I'm alsogoing to show this method decks videonow you can make sure you do this ok soreally important that you reduce thesenumbers as much as possible now let'shave a look at a couple more examplesI'll tell you what we'll look at onemore example and then what we'll do iswe'll look how we can do it for where wehave our bigger you know say we hadmultiple numbers so say we wanted towork at the least common multiple theleast common multiple of 12 and 54okay all right so we're looking for anominee goes into both of these okayfairly simple once again six goes in sixgoes into this one two times okay twotimes and it goes into this one ninetimes okay is there a number that goesinto both two and nine reducing themfurther then you can say they there'snot so we're going to be multiplyingwe're not even going to get that oldshape now because we didn't manage to goany further we're going to bemultiplying these numbers to get our LCMa lowest common multiple okay so let'smove that back so 6 times 2 is 12 times9 our lowest common multiple is 108 sothat's a fairly simple way of doing thatand that's really useful sometimes whenyou're doing things with fractions andstuff like this to find that all thesecommon multiple but see what I want toshow you right now how to do this for ifyou have three numbers okay so whatabout we'll go through a couple ofexamples of this so say you had threenumbers what would you do say we want tofind the least common multiple of 24 12and 8 okay so we look once again it'sfairly much the same thing we're lookingfor a common number that goes into bothof these we look for normally goes intoboth and you go hey four goes in fourgoes into 20 four goes into 24 what sixtimes it goes into 12 three times and itgoes into 8 two times okay is there anumber that we can reduce this furtherwith and finally enough it doesn't it'snot a number that has to go into allthree I tend to try and find um the guysin wall three at the start but it can bea number that just goes into two of themokay so is there a number that goes intoall three well one does but it doesn'treduce but the 3 goes into both of theseguys so we can divide by three okaylet's do all right I said yeah okay Idid do that yep yep three get confusedwith ocean those numbers 3 goes into 6twice and it goes into three once this 2we just move down they can't readcontinue at damp are we going to nowhave a look at is there a number thecasein to any common ones of these onesand you can say hey basic two goes intothis and it goes into these two goesinto two so I'll put the two there itgoes into this one once it goes intothis one once and this one's been movedout it's not going anywhere and we can'treduce these anymore there are no oneokay even when we multiple so we'regoing to be multiplying now thesenumbers here in fact we can almostignore those ones because we multiply byone that earth doesn't do anything doesitso our lowest called multiples this canbe 4 times 3 times 2 it's 24 okay nowI'm going to give you one more exampleof these ok are what about I will giveyou the last example here of the lowestcommon multiple of 16 24 and 36 and wewant to find the least common multiplelowest common multiple this there you gonumber 4 why don't you give this one ago okay there you go you pause that yougave me to go you said 4 went into thisone 4 times goes into this one 6 timesgoes into this one 9 times okay we canreduce either this one or this one solet's say I choose one let's divide 2into these 2 numbers 2 goes into thisone twice goes into this one thrice okaybut doesn't go into 9 evenly so we justcarry that 9 down okay and now we canlook and say 3 goes into 3 and 9 here itgoes into this one once it goes intothis one 3 times and it doesn't go to 2so we just move that to down so there'sno common number we can reduce thesewith so we're just going to multiplythese numbers out okay and that's goingto be the numbers we're going to bemultiplying it to get our least commonmean it makes like an owl so you canremember how to do this 4 times 2 is 8times 3 is 24 times 2 is 48 times 3 ourleast common mean yeah you got it144 righthey that's pretty cool yeah now I'lltell you what just a couple littlethings with this too just to be carefulof you have to reduce these numbers downbecause if you only got it to this stageyou can make mistakes you can get in beproblems four times six times four timesnine our least common mean would not becorrect so you have to reduce thesewrite down but in the next video I'mgoing to show you a way that you can dothis and you'll always get it right andI'll tell you what the type of exampleyou're going to get with this in fact wecan work out this example we're going todo next video we're going to be workingout say the least common mean of saynasty diabolical numbers like fivethousand two hundred and two and twofour three one and how you do aboutdoing this alright say this is somethingto look forward to and I look forward toseeing you then anyway take care hopethat videos with some helpsee you next time bye
