look at this picture it's a house and acouple of other things surrounded by afence the length of the fence is calledthe perimeter it is basically the lengtharound a closed figure and the regioninside the perimeter is called the areait is basically the total regionenclosed by a plain figure here thehouse the well the haystacks are all ona rectangular surface covered by a fencethe perimeter is defined as the totallength around the closed figure and thearea is the total region enclosed by aplain figure this total region inside isthe area and the length of the fence isthe perimeter let us look at a rectangleit is a shape in which the oppositesides are equal and parallel these twosides are equal and parallel these twosides are also equal and parallel toeach otheradjacent sides uh perpendicular to eachother so all these four angles are rightangles the larger side is called thelength and the smaller side is calledthe breadth let us denote the length bythe letter L and the breadth by theletter B so these two sides are L andthese two sides are P this is arectangular plane and is surrounded bythese four sides so this length in redwill be the perimeter it equals L plus Bplus L plus B that equals 2l plus 2 B 2is a common factor and hence this can bewritten as 2 multiplied by L plus B soif we have a rectangle of length 3centimeters and breadth two centimetersthen the perimeter would equal 2multiplied by 3 plus 2 that equals 2multiplied by 5 which is 10 centimetersall we did issubstitute the value of length andbreadth here in a similar way we canfind the formula for the perimeter of acouple of other simple figures we willcover that next
