the game of hex is usually played on an11 by 11 board of hexagons two oppositesides of the board are owned by red andthe other two by blue the players taketurns placing their pieces on unoccupiedhexagons the first player to connecttheir opposite sides with a path winswhat makes the game so special hexcannot result in a tie one player mustwin you might want to try a few gameswith a friend there's a link in thevideo description with a printable boardyou can even both try to lose butsomebody will still winPeck's was first invented by Danishmathematician Piet Hein in 1942 andindependently in 1947 by John Nash whoby the way never looked anything likeRussell Crowe some Princeton Universitystudents refer to the game as Johnsupposedly because of the hex tiles on abathroom floor but eventually it becamea board game called X so why must someone always win suppose every hexagon isfilled in highlight every edge thatseparates a blue hexagon from a redhexagon we also treat the blue and redsides of the board as hexagons so forexample if there's a red hexagontouching the blue side we highlight theedges where they meet a carefulexamination shows that there are exactlytwo chains of highlighted edges thispath connects these two corners and thispath connects the other two corners eachpath divides blue hexagons from redhexagons because the black chain goesfrom one corner to another this meansthat there is a path of hexagons thatwins for one player now we just need toshow that there's always a chain ofhighlighted edges that connects twocorners how do we do this first we needto understand what happens at thejunction where three hexagons meetnotice that there are eight ways to pickcolors for the three hexagons for any ofthese combinations there are either zeroor two highlighted edges meeting at thejunction nois also that each corner hexagon musthave a highlighted edge no matterwhether the corner hexagon is coloredblue or red at least one of its edgeswill be highlighted since each Junctiontouches either zero or two highlightededges these chains must grow and can'tstop otherwise there would be a junctionwith only one edge but where do they gothe chain can't connect back to itselfthen there would be an illegal junctionwith three highlighted edges the onlyother option is for the chains of thecorners to connect just like we sawbefore we now have a chain ofhighlighted edges connecting one side ofthe board to the other and therefore acolored path this argument doesn't workfor square grids here is a way to makevertical and horizontal barriers so thatnobody wins also our argument does notdepend on the size of the board so theremust be a winner on this board as well afun way to see this hex property inaction is to look at a map let's labeltwo land boundaries and two waterboundaries we could impose a hexagonalgrid on the map and require that eachhexagon is either land or water thenthere must be either a way to walk fromone land edge to the other or a way tosail a ship from one water edge to theother you can see the difficulty we haveto determine whether hexagons containingthe Suez Canal are water or land wellI'll let you wrestle with that one heyguys our team is excited with the newvideos that we're putting together socome back soonor even better subscribedyou
