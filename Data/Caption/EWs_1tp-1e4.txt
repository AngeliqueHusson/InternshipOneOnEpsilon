It also became
clear that there wasone other way to increase the
capacity of a communicationsystem.We can increase the number of
different signalling events.For example, with Alice and
Bob's string communicationsystem, they soon found that
varying the type of plucksallowed them to send
their messages faster.For example, hard, medium,
versus soft plucks,or high pitch versus
low pitch plucksby tightening the cable
different amounts.And this was an idea implemented
by Thomas Edison, whichhe applied to the
Morse code system.And it was based on
the idea that youcould use weak and
strong batteriesto produce signals of
different strengths.He also used two directions,
as Gauss and Weber did, forwardversus reverse current,
and two intensities.So he had plus 3 volts,
plus 1 volt, minus 1 volt,and minus 3 volt-- four
different current valueswhich could be exchanged.It enabled Western
Union to save moneyby greatly increasing the number
of messages the company couldsend without building new lines.And this is known as the
quadruplex telegraph,and it continued to be
used into the 20th century.But again, as we
expanded the numberof different signaling events,
we ran into another problem.For example, why not send
a thousand or a milliondifferent voltage
levels per pulse?Well, as you may expect,
fine-grain differenceslead to difficulties
on the receiving end.And with electrical systems, the
resolution of these differencesis always limited
by electrical noise.If we attach a probe
to any electrical lineand zoom in closely
enough, we will alwaysfind minute, undesired currents.And this is an unavoidable
result of natural processes,such as heat, or
geomagnetic storms,and even latent effects
of the big bang.So the differences between
signaling events must be greatenough that noise cannot
randomly bump a signaling eventfrom one type to another.Clearly, now, we can
step back and beginto define the capacity of a
communication system usingthese two very simple ideas.First, how many symbol
transfers per second,which we called symbol rate?And today, it's known simply
as baud, for Emile Baudot.And we can define
this as n, whereit's n symbol
transfers per second.And number two, how many
differences per symbol, whichwe can think of as
the symbol space?How many symbols can we
select from at each point?And we can call this s.And as we've seen
before, these parameterscan be thought of as a
decision tree of possibilities,because each symbol can be
thought of as a decision wherethe number of branches depend
on the number of differences.And after n symbols,
we have a tree with sto the power of n leaves.And since each path through this
tree can represent a message,we can think of the
number of leavesas the size of
the message space.And this is easy to visualize.The message space is simply
the width of the base of oneof these trees.And it defines the total
number of possible messagesone could send given a
sequence of n symbols.For example, let's
say Alice sends Boba message which
consists of two plucks,and they're using a
hard versus soft pluckas their communication system.This means she has
the ability to defineone of four possible
messages to Bob.And if instead they were using
a system of hard versus mediumversus soft plucks,
then with two plucks,she has the ability to define
one of 3 to the power of 2equals 9 messages.And with three plucks, this
jumps to one of 27 messages.Now if instead, Alice and Bob
were exchanging written notesin class, which contain only
two letters on a piece of paper,then a single note would contain
1 of 26 to the power of 2,or 676 possible messages.It's important to realize
now that we no longer careabout the meaning applied to
these chains of differences--merely how many different
messages are possible.The resulting sequences could
represent numbers, names,feelings, music, or perhaps
even some alien alphabetwe could never understand.When we look at a
communication system now,we can begin to think
about its capacityas how many different
things you could say.And we can then use
the message spaceto define exactly
how many differencesare possible in any situation.And this simple yet elegant
idea forms the basisfor how information
will be later defined.And this is the final step that
brings us to modern informationtheory, and it emerges in
the early 20th century.
