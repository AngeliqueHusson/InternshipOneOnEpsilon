- Hi, welcome to this question right here.
So, we have two similar triangles righthere. That did tell us it's similar,
right? So, don't worry about it. It issimilar. We need to calculate the missing
length. Turns out the missing length isright here, okay?
So, what you do first is you have to setup like a proportional fraction. So, let's
put an equal sign right here. And put up afraction sign and a fraction sign. So,
what you do is this, you know that thesetwo are similar triangles, okay? So, the
shorter side with the shorter side,there's a ratio that's involved between
these two so, my own little preference isI'm gonna take the bigger number that goes
first. So, I'm gonna put a two right here,for the bigger triangle. This side right
here versus this side, which is 0.5, okay?Then, I'm gonna try to figure out my
missing x right here. So, this missing xcorresponds to the six over here, okay?
Because the hypotenuse and the hypotenuseof the two triangles would go together.
So, the six over here of my biggertriangle will match the x here for my
little triangle. So once again, the biggeron the top, smaller on the bottom. Just
because the math is easier. The six isover here, and the x is over here, okay?
Now, maybe now you're not go with thealgebra. But you can just think about
this. They are the same ratio to eachother. All you need to do is think about
how to go from two to six. Well,mathematically, going from two to six, you
just have to times it by three. And sinceyou times by three to the top, you have to
do the same thing to the bottom, right?So, 0.5 times by 3, you get yourself a 1.5
at the very end.So, x over here turns out just to be a 1.5
meters. And that is your final answer.Thanks for watching.
