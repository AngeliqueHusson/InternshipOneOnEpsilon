okay let's take a moment to compare thestrange methdirection the standard algorithmand school now just recall when I dosomething like 512 Tegrity 347 I just goleft to rightwhy not 5 take away 3 is 2 1 check when4 is negative 3 to the rate of 7 isnegative 5 some are really doing isadding the opposite 347 and after someannihilations we get to negative 3negative 5 200 negative 3 to negative 5grant and then we did an explosion tofix us up for society I believe you'vegot the answer 165 from that all rightwhat's the standard algorithms let's seeif it's actually doing the same thingnow it starts of course by going whatfeels backwards to me right to left andyou say ok to take away 7 we said Ican't do that I can't do to take away 7now I want to write negative 5 and I canyou can too but the standard album saysno no no what I want you to do is takeone of these dots here and make it oneless now I have zero of them and puthere an extra 10 dots there do you seewhat that was so I taking one of thesedots making extra 10 or one of thesedots making extra 10 that was just anunexploitednow here's the sneaky thing they don'twrite 10 they have you write a littleone right next is 2 and make that 10 andthat to become a 12 little short capshortcut for saving Inc so now we've got12 take away 7 is 5 grand then you go tonext column 0 take right 4th say can'tdo it well of course you can you writenegative 4 and be correct however in thestandard album they say no no take oneof these dots make one less and thenwhat I'm going to do now is an explodingextra 10 here but you don't write 10 youjust put a little one next to it justmake that one zero actually tend tobegin with 1004 6/4 omega-3 is onebeautiful so the standard algorithm isactually doing exactly the same thing asme it just goes right to left and doesthe unexploded as you go along usersvery much less Inc maybe well maybe usesmore ink I don't know okay but it goesright left it does unexploded as you goalong I go left to right and do theunexposed at the end again it's a stylething all correct math is good andcorrect but they all lead to the sameArts in the end 165 165brilliant whatever you like best is upto you to do your choice choice lovemath I love its flexibility and the loveits creativity here beautiful stuff
