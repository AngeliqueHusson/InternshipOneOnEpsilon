the one idea that undergirds everythingis what we call frequency now frequencythis is a word you've met before you'vedone some statistics back in years 9 and10 even in your son's name frequency asthe name suggests is about howfrequently does something occur howfrequently does something occur soyou've gone and you've got your sampleyou've asked them all of your surveyquestions and then when you have a lookat their answers you want to kind of getsome patterns out of it so here's myformal description for what frequency isit's how many times does you know anypiece of data like how many people inthis room are girls how many people areboys how many times that piece of dataoccur so that's what we mean byfrequency how frequently is thishappening in the target population or inthe sample or whatever we're looking atokay now it's really important just likebefore when we're looking at tools likewhich which kind of sample should we usewhich of these concepts and I'm gonnaexplain a few more kinds of frequency ina second which of these concepts you useand you apply to a situation reallydepends on what are you using it forlike what are you trying to get out ofthis data what one will be useful forokay so frequency as an overarching ideais all about identifying patterns andtrends so for instance I might beinterested inwell if we had a look at public schoolsversus private schools is there adisparity between the number of boys andgirls taking taking mathematics forinstance that would be an interestingquestion for me and to work out whatkind of pattern or trend is there ormaybe a trend over time I don't know howfrequently the boys and girls are doingthat in such and such an such a schoolokay so that's what frequencies now thenunderneath these three rows that areremaining we've got three differentkinds of frequency which kind of justtease out this idea a little more okayso the first one is what we callrelative frequency based on the nameI wonder how many of you could give me asuggestion as to what you think it meansrelative frequency what are you gonna govery good so that relative word rightmeans I'm not just interested in okay ina school you know I could say 200 girlsdo you mathematics I could say that okaynow is that a lot or is it a little andthe answer is I don't know because Ineed to know that in relation to likethe number of boys in relation to thewhole school population if the school'sonly two into people then that's amazingand also somewhat strange okay if theschool's two thousand will that meansomething very different doesn't it okayso here's my proper formal definitionfor relative frequency it's about likefrequency as a fraction or because youcan represent a fraction as a percentageyou could do a percentage as wellit's the frequency as a fraction orpercentage of the total population solet's compare it to everyone in thisgroup so again the important question iswell where is this going when is ituseful and the thing I just alluded tois a great example so if I'm comparingdifferent groups and the populationsizes of those groups are very verydifferent rightI guess maybe we could say for example200 girls do maths this depends entirelyon the size of the turtle population sorather than saying 200 girls to do mathsit might be much more meaningful to meto say 50% of girls do maths or 50% ofthe school rather it does maths or ahundred percent of the school doesn'task all those kinds of things are givingme much more meaning than just that wallnumber okay so relative frequency nowthis middle road when the data is I'mgoing to leave this blank for a secondI'm going to explain the two kinds offrequency that belong down here and thenat the end I'm gonna ask you if you canfill in for me there are lots ofdifferent types of data that you knowabout do you remember this diagram thisone that looks like this okay so youknow about a whole bunch of differentkinds of data I want you to think as Idescribe these next two and tell mewhich of these you think they apply toyou okay so we looked at relativefrequency the next kind is calledcumulative frequency now when Iintroduced this diner in statisticstopic I actually talked about cumulativefrequency as an example of like amisleading graphI do I doso obviously the challenge here isworking how do i articulate I get theideabut what words am I going to use here mywords okay what you're thinking outagain is frequency but what you want isthe total frequency and you're sort ofkeeping up with things as the quantitiesthat you're looking at are growing andgrowing and growing so the way that wewould say this is the total frequency upto and including now I'm going to giveyou a arm a new phrase here up to anincluding each data point so a datapoint is like a specific instance in ourgraph such as okay let's recordtemperatures over the course of the yearokay a data point might be okay 30degrees 30 degrees that's an interestingkind of number can you tell me all ofthe days how many days had temperaturesup to and including 30 degrees so you'dadd up the 30 degree days and the 29degree days and 28 and so on okaynow figure out this one when is thisgoing to be useful why would you usebecause I show you when you shouldn'tuse cumulative frequency when it'sactually misleading but when we wouldactually be useful to work this outany thoughts when might be an actualsituationokay so if you want to make a predictionif you want again we talked earlier onabout patterns and trends so if you'retrying to make a forecast for the futureworking out how this thing is working ata community frequency graph might bemuch more useful let me give you aparticular exampleI'll phrase it for you and then I'llgive you the example so if what I wantto do is show progress for example overthe course of a year or something likethat if I've got particularly meaningfuldata points that go together I can showprogress or I can group together thosedata points now unfortunately this wordhere meaningful is very very vague andit kind of has to be because it couldmean a whole bunch of different thingsso let me give you an example you mightwant to say okay well what's the totalrainfall for this year how manymillimeters of rain have we gotten okayand it would just make sense to say okaywell let's just look at each day andjust add up the millimeters and you'regonna get a number by the end of theyear and that'll tell you has this beena really rainy year or not so muchokay that's showing progress meaningfuldata points could be all kinds of thingstell me all of the people in this classwho are able to you know score a 200above on a game of bowling temping boysomething like thatright well which is a pretty decentscore right well you got us count up allthe people it's got two hundred and$1.99 and 198 etc it's very difficult todescribe bowling scores and temperaturesor rainfall all in the same way sothat's why I just say meaningful okayone last kind of frequency one last kindwhich is what we call groups or classfrequencynow just because we're looking at thistable right now I'm just gonna describeit for you but I'm going to give youexamples later on in this double periodbecause it's it's sort of its own ideabut it's related that's why I'm showingit to you the idea is that what we wantto do is take a whole bunch of scoresindividual scores and condense themcondense all those individual scores indo well just like the just like the namesuggests put them together in groupsoften those drips are called classes sothat's why it's got these two differentnames okay so if you can condense thoseindividual scores into groups orclusters or hey all of you people whoare between a hundred and fiftycentimeters and 160 centimeters tall orall of the people who have scoredbetween 80 and 90 we call them bandfivesokay condensing those individual scoresinto clusters what it helps you see islarger patterns become more obviousso I wonder if you could put up yourhand if you've heard the phrase don'tlose the forest for the trees who'sheard that phrase I'm actuallyinterested anyone find really one toothis is Penhall now we're having a bet Isaid about a quartershe said eight we're both wrong thosedays the forest for the trees meansdon't get so caught up in little bit allmy new details that you miss the factthat there's this huge structure herewhich you just kind of need to zoom outa little bit and see okay there's thismassive structure that I need tounderstand okay
