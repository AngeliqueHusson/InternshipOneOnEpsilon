what do sea slugs lettuce and potatochips have in common clearly not enoughhowever they do have one importantuseful and beautiful thing in common thegeometries of these surfaces may all benon Euclidean so what does that meanwell we can find out easily but it'sgoing to take some imagination take yournormal plane maybe you imagine it as atable that goes on forever in alldirections or as one big sheet of graphpaper there are five basic things you'veprobably taken for granted about thisplane around 300 BC you live laid outfive postulates in mathematics apostulate is something you assume to betrue you might think that math has a lotof rules but postulates are thefundamental rules and using only thefive postulates laid out by Euclid onecan prove any other rule or statement ofEuclidean geometry the first four are tothe point obvious and classy first youcan draw a straight line between any twopoints second any line segment can beextended indefinitely in a straight linethird given any straight line segment acircle can be drawn with the segment asthe radius and one of the end points asthe center fourth all right angles arecongruent and here's the fifth given aline and a point not on that line thereis exactly one line through that pointparallel to our first line in otherwords there is exactly one line throughthat point that will never touch theother one extended infinitely this thingis that this is much less elegant thanthe other four and because of thismathematicians have sought to prove itusing the other four rules which wouldmake the last rule not a postulate but atheorem at theorem is a true statementin mathematics that can be proven usingpostulates and other theorems this fifthpostulate is used to prove many theoremsbut one thing that will become importantto us is the theorem that states thatthe measure the angles of any trianglealways add up to 180 degrees since we'vetaken these rules for granted let's seewhat happens if we try to imagine aplane where one of them isn't true thisis significant because if you are ableto imagine a plane where thefour postulates of Euclidean geometryare true but the fifth isn't you wouldconclude that the first four rules don'tresult in the fifth this would provethat the fifth rule is a postulate forEuclidean geometry geometries thatfollow the first four rules withoutfollowing the fifth are called nonEuclidean because they don't follow allof Euclid's rules let's now go back tothinking about a plane as a table or asheet of paper that extends forever inall directions just like that as a modelfor Euclidean geometry there are manydifferent models of hyperbolic geometrypeople come up with but this is roughlythe shape most of them represent all wehave to do to see how this is nonEuclidean is treat the surface like amathematical plane the same you would dowhen drawing a graph on a piece of paperone two threeforfive this doesn't really work if I drewthe same straight lines on a regularsheet of paperthey clearly intersect if you draw atriangle clearly these angles don't addup to 180 degrees they add up to lessthis is the model of non-euclideangeometry called hyperbolic even if allthis seems abstract to you I'm sure manyof you have come across hyperbolicgeometry in your life before withouteven realizing it one application ofhyperbolic geometry and art is in thework of Escher and these he's is adifferent model of the hyperbolic planeplants and animals take on formsreminiscent of hyperbolic geometry seaslugs lettuce algae shells snails kelpnoodle branches jellyfish tentaclescoral and many other surfaces in natureimitate the hyperbolic plane which is tosay if you treated it as a plane itwould satisfy the first four ruleswithout satisfying the fifth complexnetworks like computer networkstechnological networks brain networksand social networks like Internet seemto follow hyperbolic geometryit also has applications in turbulenceand in Brownian motion which is supercool and foodPringles actually have to do withhyperbolic geometry and a sort ofroundabout way they're shaped likehyperbolic paraboloidsif you were to zoomin on a single pointon the hyperbolic plane the area aroundit would look like a Pringle one thingthat's really important to realize isthat mathematics seems to be completelyabstract but instead it has manyapplications to the real world butsometimes it takes as many years torecognize it my point is that youshouldn't go on thinking we live in apurely Euclidian or purely non Euclideanworld to quote Henri Poincare II onegeometry could not be more true thananother it can only be more convenient
