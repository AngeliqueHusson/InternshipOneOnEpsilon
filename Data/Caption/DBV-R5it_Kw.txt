now we're going to do is switch gears alittle bit and talk about what we talkedabout a little bit in the beginningterms coefficients and expressions a lotof these terms you know these thesedefinitions confuse people but there'sreally no reason to confused by this atall here we have you know an expressionthis expression has only one termbecause there's only one sort of littleunit together six times D and as adefinition you need to know that whensomeone talks about the coefficient thenwhat they're talking about is the numberthat sits in front of the variable sothis is the coefficient so anytime youhave a number sitting out in front ofletters which you're gonna see a lot inalgebra the number is called thecoefficient right and and so on so let'sthis is very simple because there's onlyone thing here but let me go ahead andwrite a little bit more complicated onedown and you'll see how to deal with itwhat if you had the expression negativex times y minus four times t plus 35this whole thing is called an expressionthe whole thing is called an expressionright so let me write that downjust to kind of show you it's analgebraic expression so here we gothis is an expression in other words anexpression is like the whole enchiladaall right now how many terms do youthink are contained in this expression aterm is like a little nugget of goodnessthey're all you know either added orsubtracted this is a term this is a termthis is a term of the expression so howmany terms do we have we actually havethree terms so here we have one thereone there one there so we draw a littlenice little big fat arrow or somethinglike this we have three terms inside ofthis algebraic expression so if I'm atest say how many terms do you have wellthere you go you have things addedtogether there are three of them sothat's called the terms three terms sowhat is the coefficient of the firstterm of this expression well this is thefirst term the coefficient is the numberin front so here the coefficient isequal to whatnegative one that's the number that'ssitting out in front I know there's noone there but because there's always aone implied there and there's a negativethere at the coefficients negative onewhat is the coefficient of the middleterm right well if you look at this thisis the middle term the coefficient thereis negative four is that's the numbersitting out front and then for this lastguy there's no variable here so youcould kind of say the coefficients 35but you know since there's really noother letters there you probablywouldn't be asked that but if you justsee a number you could say thecoefficients 35 it's not as meaningfulthough typically coefficients are whenyou look at numbers that are sitting infront of the letters so let's give youanother little example here kind ofdrill this in a little bit more let'ssay you have something like negative 4times X times y times Z plus 7 times X
