[Music]hey guys go over here and today I'm inthe tree yeah well today we're going tobe teaching about with distributiveproperty I have some dots and I want tomultiply them by 2 so I'm going toreplace each dot with two dots like thislet's do the rest now I have 2 times asmany dots that's multiplication thedistributive property is a special wayof multiplying when you multiply anumber you're allowed to break thenumber into pieces multiply each pieceseparately and then put the results backtogether it seems really obvious rightthis is a super useful property you useit all the time and you may not evennotice that you're using it so I'll letme show you the basic rule of thedistributive property so let's move downalright so we'll be showing you basicsolution before we show you how todistribute a rule so let's see make 1 by2 each dot will be replaced by 2 so forexample now let's be real[Music]- then all the disturber you're probablywhat it does it allows you to separatethem into two groups and then multiplythe two groups both by the number sowe'll multiply it by two so poison eachother - now little side all right veryhappy and I would add the two togetherand I'll get the exact same as alwaysjealous that seems really obviousconfused but things tend to getconfusing when you write it with a bunchof numbers and messages so let's do itagain with all the symbols and restoredit out we have six when we wannamultiply it by two first we're going toget rid of the extra skin will 4multiply and we see with a dot it's justanother way to say multiply now let'smove the 2 out of the way for a bitwe'll divide the 6 into piecesfirst we'll multiply the four part bytwo[Music]that gives us eight men will multiplythe two part by two as well that givesus four now we put the results backtogether to make 12 it's still easy sodon't let the massive old mix see moreconfusing min is all right now forsecond jet example and tree now we'regoing to be multiplying 3 by 31 butsince I don't know my story one cablesby house I'll use the distributiveproperty to break the problems down intotwo problems that I know I saw you knowbut when you is split into two pause thestory one went well into two box as youcan see kind of all is being separatedright he'll go into a story in the onenow Okamoto pause the one full bodycomes through equal weight you know 3 4times 3 equals 90 you can see metogether equals 93 and they do this isthe distributor from so yay all right sonow for one logs in this one we're goingto be doing it the way I first starteddoing multiplication in exploring dethis time we're going to be multiplying11 by this 23 we're going to multiplyeach separately so many is the destroyerfamily disappoint everything all rightlet's do the 210-foot now each are onthe top is replaced by the pattern onthe bottom sosorry easier so we multiplied that 10 by11 get 110 and now unlevel 10 anotherone but it's going to be a wonderfultaste I'll end up at 11 now I love thelumber one more give all the replacementwe made all right all right so now wehave our inputs 253 so that's what 23times of this Oh as it was a 20 you knowor you could say 10 times 11 Plus 10times 11 Plus 3 plus 1 times 1 plus 1times women of one-time gloves so that'swhat we didsorry if I gave you a headache there ohboy there's always many to transfer holdyou near the discovery deformity tocreate your own ways of doing that musicfrom this video contraband sound[Music]you
