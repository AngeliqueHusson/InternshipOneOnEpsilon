of X equals 3x minus 2 but that's when Xis less than or equal to negative 1 andf of X equals 2x plus 4 and that's whenX is greater than negative 1 and I'llhave a link to how to actually graphthese piecewise functions another videoI did you can take a look at that if youwant to see how to graph them butbasically when you see f of X whatyou're thinking yourself is this is theY value this is the output and itdepends like if I have an x value that'sless than or equal to negative 1 this isthe part of the function that I'm onthis is a equation that I want to use tocalculate that value but when X isgreater than negative 1 then I want touse this part of the graph this part ofthe function this piece okay so to speakand so that's how it works so basicallylet's look at this first one we've got Fof negative 4 equals blank ok let's seeso whatever is in the parentheses youcan see this is the x value this is theinput and is negative 4 less than orequal to negative 1 yes so that means wewant to put negative 4 right in here forX that's going to be negative 12 minus 2which is negative 14 so that's ouranswernow the next one F of negative 1 wellyou can see this is a negative 1 this isnegative 1 but notice this is equal tothis is not equal to so that meansnegative 1 is going to go into thisfirst equation here in place of X sowhat we have is 3 times negative 1 minus2 that's negative 3 minus 2 which isnegative 5 and then the last one f of 7okay is let's see is X greater thannegative 1 yes see 7 is greater thannegative 1 so that means we want to putit into this second equation here 2times 7 right plus 4 that's 14 plus 4which is 18 so that's our answer so youhave to figure out which part of theequation that you're on and then applyit to that part
