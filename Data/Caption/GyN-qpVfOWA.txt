MATT FURNISS: There's eight
games today, so there's oneearly game kicking off in
15 minutes, QPR-Norwich.Then six games at 3 o'clock,
and then one lategame at half 5:00.So yeah, it'll get busy
around 3 o'clock.We are the content and customer
service team, so wewill provide all the stats
for our Twitterfeeds, for our clients.Editorially, we'll be doing
features, packs for TVcompanies, sending everything
out to the newspapers.Whereas the guys in the other
room in the operation's team,they'll b recording all the
data, and they will be, sortof handling everything that
goes on behind the scenes.We can't plan what's
going to happen.We have a set routine of
things we need to do.We have a list of everything
we need to do, but, I mean,football is unpredictable.You can never tell what's
going to happen.So this is our analysis room.At the moment, they're analyzing
the game live.We have a guy for each
team and a checker.So if anyone has any questions
about the dates they'reputting in, they'll flag it up,
and then the checker cancheck by just going back,
replaying the footage, andthen re-inputting the data.On certain games, we record
about 1,800 actions a game,so, I mean around 900 a team.Obviously it's going to be a lot
more if you're analyzingBarcelona than you are Stoke
or QPR or Norwich.We have about 200 applications
every summerfor operations guys.Maybe four or five will get
through to the final sectionwhere they'll be trained up.I mean, hand-eye coordination
has to be amazing.I couldn't do this myself.I'm too slow.But these guys, I mean, a
few of them have beenhere for a few years.So they build up a great skill
set to be able to do this.SAM GREEN: I definitely
could not do it.And I know the hand-eye
coordination they have, soit's a pretty intense--you've got to be doing it.It's live.You're 45 minutes late.They've got a little bit of
time to go back and checkerrors during the breaks, and we
obviously go through everymatch after it's happened.But while they're doing it, it's
a pretty intense 45, 50minutes at a time where you
don't have much let-up, andit's a pretty impressive
demonstration of skills.I'm not sure what skills, and
how they've built them up, butit is more than I can
do, certainly.MATT FURNISS: It takes a
unique kind of person.I mean, if you're good at
computer games, it helps.And you have to have a really,
really good knowledge offootball as well.So the speed at which everything
happens, you haveto be able to tell which player
is which, at least in ablink of an eye.So if someone is wearing yellow
boots, you might beable to say that means
that's that player.And sometimes, I mean, you might
have Rafael and Fabio,two twins on the team.So you've got to know the
characteristics ofeach player as well.Despite they're both from
different wings, if somethingwas to come into the box, you
might need to know if onewears white boots, one has
tape around his socks orsomething like that.So yeah, you can pick that up.A lot of it is communication.If one of them has a question,
he might saycan you double check.A defender may have made a
clearance, but it might havebeen a long ball instead.So they'd ask to check it to
just check that replay, andthen if it needs correcting,
correct it straight away.They'll say, here we can replay
the data, and they candouble check and
pause and see.So quite often, if there's a
deflection on a goal, andwe're not sure if it's a known
goal, we can then slow itdown, replay it, pause it, so
we can take different anglesand have a look at whether it
is a known goal or not.Luckily, the early game today
is a dull affair between QPRand Norwich.I say that now, and when you
film again at nine minutes,it'll be 4-0.But yeah, I mean, there's not
much going on at the momentuntil something big
happens, maybe agoal, red card, penalty.We're liaising.We have commentators for the
game across the worldproviding them with
facts and data.So yeah, just waiting for
something big to happen, andthen we can get down
and do our job.BRADY HARAN: How common is it
that you will pull togethersome fact or amazing piece of
trivia, send it off from yourcomputer, and then you hear it
come across on the TV a minuteor two later?MATT FURNISS: Yeah,
quite often.I mean, there was a famous one
in the World Cup a few yearsago when Rob Green disastrously
let ClintDempsey's shot through his
hands against the USA.And straightaway, our team
were on to it, and weremembered that he'd actually
made the most mistakes leadingto goals in the Premier League
that season as well.ITV mentioned it, and we were
being told on [INAUDIBLE] thatacross the world, commentators
were mentioning our fact thatit was an [INAUDIBLE].So that was a really
nice moment for us.And then, yeah, you
quite often--I see Mark's doing
the commentatorsupport at the moment.You'll hear something that he's
just put across to themwithin 30 seconds.So that's as quick as
is it can happen.So say if now there's a red
card, we could research a factabout that red card.Say it might be the player's
eighth red card.I need two players.I've got more.Or they're the team with the
most red cards this season.We could put that straight to
the commentator, and then theycan have it out and mention it
on screen within a minute.So, I mean, while the action is
fresh and while the stat isfresh, they'll have
it out there.BRADY HARAN: The commentators
sound so knowledgeable whenthey do that.Does that frustrate you and
make you think, youdidn't do know that.That was because of
me or is that--MATT FURNISS: In fairness, the
commentators do a lot ofresearch before the game.We're helping them out.That's our job.QPR just won a penalty.Norwich had given it away.So I can have a quick look now
to see how many penalties havebeen given this season for each
side using our database.Right.So we can have a quick look now
to see Norwich's recordthis season running a report.This season, QPR have
won two penalties.Both of them have been against
Norwich, home and away, andthey've had both
of them saved.SAM GREEN: QPR has now
had the last threepenalties in a row saved.So I'll put that straight
through now to this guy who'sdoing the commentary.The decision to retain a player
or sign a player is, Imean, it's literally a
multimillion pound or euro ordollar or whatever, it's a
multi-million somethinginvestment.I can't imagine many other
walks of life, many otherbusinesses where you would
just take that based uponsomeone's feel and intuition,
and you'd have someone sittingthere watching them
do their job.It doesn't make sense.You'd normally have numbers in
some way of quantifying that.MATT FURNISS: The game ended in
a board draw, not the bestfor our analysis.There's not too much
to talk about.So we're trying to
put together somepage-matched facts now.QPR, now five unbeaten in the
Premier League, which is thebest run in the Premier League
since March '95.And obviously, want to to know
about how Harry Redknapp hasdrawn more games nil-nil than
any other manager in thePremier League, 62nd that was.What we do now is we just put
together the page-matchedfacts, save all the stats for
the game, send them out to themedia, and then just wait for
the 3 o'clock games and thefun to start.I'd say it's been an
above-average day for action.There's quite a lot going on.There's six games
at the moment.Lukas Podolski just scored for
Arsenal, but it seems to bedisallowed.But, yeah, I mean, it's
been pretty hectic.I mean, there's a flurry of
goals around the midway pointof the first half, so yeah,
there's been right plenty ofstuff coming out today,
so yeah, it's good.
