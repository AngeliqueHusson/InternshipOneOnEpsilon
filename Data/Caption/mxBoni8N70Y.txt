okay in this video we're going to talkabout graphing linear functions byfinding X intercepts and y intercepts sothere's other ways to graph linearfunctions you can use slope interceptform is definitely another way that'svery common but this technique actuallyworks to find x and y-intercepts ingeneral as well so the idea with alinear function one thing that kind ofmakes them special is if you have twopoints that you know that the functiongoes through since it's linearwell it's got to look like a line so howabout we move that point up a little bitwe know it has to be since it's a linetwo points uniquely determine the graphof a linear function so in order tograph the functions what we're going todo is instead of kind of finding twopoints arbitrarily we're going to findtwo specific points namely we're goingto find the y-intercept and we're goingto find the x-intercept and once we havethose two points we can just simply playconnect the dots and that will give usthe graph well how do we go aboutfinding for example the y-intercept wellthe thing to notice is to find they-intercept anywhere along the y axiswhat does the x coordinate have to equalwell no matter what height your app thex coordinate is always zero and the ycoordinate is the value that we don'tknow we're trying to figure out sobasically it says to find the ycoordinate we should let X equal 0 tofind the x coordinate think about it thesame way anywhere along the x axis wedon't know what the x coordinate is forthis point generically we would like tofind it but we know that the ycoordinate has to be 0 so we'll simplyplug in y equals 0 and solve so again insummary it says to find the xintercepts okay so the x-intercepts itsays will substitute y equals zero andsolve for x it says to find they-intercept we're going to substitute inx equals zero and then solve for y okayso let's do a couple examples hereI mean obviously one thing that's goingto be important is simply recognizing inthe first place that what you're givenis a linear function maybe theinstructions will just tell you hey thisis a linear function and graph it sosuppose the instructions say graph willsay 2x plus 4y equals 12 and we'll do itby the method of finding X interceptsand y intercepts again when I look atthis I see it X to the first power a Yto the first power neither of which arein the denominators of any fractionsthen an equal sign and just kind ofnumbers floating around notice again theexponents on the X and the wire to thefirst power so that is going to indicatethat you have a linear function so againdefine the y-intercept to find they-intercept I'm simply going to plug inthe value of 0 for X so if I plug in 0for X I'll get 2 times 0 plus 4 times yequals 12 well 2 times 0 is simply 0 soI'm left with the equation for y equals12 if we divide both sides by 4 whoopsby Y by 4 we'll get the value of yequals 3 so it says when thex-coordinate is 0 if you imagine makinglike plotting points it says if you plug0 in you get 3 out so 0 3 up here it'sgoing to be a point on our graph thatour linear function goes through and nowthe other thing that we'll do is we'llfind the x-interceptand to find the x-intercept we'll simplysubstitute in again a a y-value of zerothis time so if I plug that into myequation I'll get two x plus four timeszero equals twelveso again four times zero is simply zerothis is the point of plugging in xequals 0 or y equals zero it reduces toan equation with just one variable we'llget 2x equals 12 or x equals 6 so againif you think about your little chartover here it says if you plug in the Yvalue of zero we get six out for X sowe'll be over here at the point sixcomma zerowe'll play connect the dots here I can'tget it there that looks pretty good andthere would be the graph of our functionup here whoops here's our graph of theline 2x plus 4y equals 12 okay so maybewe can do one more here real quick Ithink maybe I'll go through this onejust to touch fasterlet's fix or graph up here real quickokay so I don't know let's graph 3xminus 2y equals 8 ok again so the exactsame idea if we want to find thex-interceptobviously the order you do this doesn'treally matter if you find thex-intercept to find the x-interceptwe'll let y equal 0 so we'll get 3xminus 2 times 0 equals 8 again 2 times 0is 0so we're left with just the 3x equalspart of our equation if we divide bothsides by 3 we'll simply be left with xequals well 8/3 8/3 again here's what 2and 2/3 so I usually just leave mynumbers as fractions I don't make themas mixed numbers and likewise to findthe y-intercept we'll do very analogousthing we'll simply substitute in xequals 0 so we'll get 3 times 0 minus 2yequals 8 3 times 0 is simply going togive us 0 so that part's gone divideboth sides by negative 2 and we'll get ay-value of negative 4 so this time ourgraph is going to have a y-coordinate ofnegative 4 again two points is enough todetermine the graph of a linear functionwe just play connect the dots here andagain there's the graph of your linearfunction now 3x minus 2y equals 8 sohopefully nothing nothing too bad Ithink you know the worst thing thatmight happen again is your equation youjust end up with kind of weird numbersor weird fractions whatever those arebut otherwise I thinkduring the X and y intercept method is apretty good way to graph linearfunctions again if the linear equationis y equals it's just going to be ahorizontal line and so maybe that's yequals 2x equals 8/3 would be a verticalline okay so you still need to recognizethat those are linear equations but anyother type of linear equation you can dothis trick finding X intercepts and yintercepts so I hope this helps you outif you have any questions shoot me anemailI'll be happy to try to make some senseout of it
