the probability it's defined as thenumber of successes divided by the totalpossible outcomesokay so probability just in basic termsit's what you wantokay the chance of something occurringthat you do want divided by the totalpossible things that could happen rightand that's called the theoreticaltheoretical probability okaywhereas odds you're comparing favorableoutcomes to unfavorable or in the way Iwould like to say it is what you want towhat you don't want okay so let's lookat some examples and we'll compare sosay for example here you have a hatthere's three red marbles two bluemarbles and one black marble in the Hatwe want to find out what's theprobability that you're blindfolded youreach in and you pick a red marble wellaccording to our definition there'sthree chances of getting a red marbleright so the probability would be threedivided by the total number of outcomeswhich is six and you can reduce thatdown to one half so that's theprobability okay you can also write thisas 0.5 so probability is in between zeroand one zero means no chance one means ahundred percent guaranteed okay nowlet's do a different example say we wantto know the odds that you pick a redmarble well there's three favorableoutcomes three things that you want okaycompared to three things that you don'twant unfavorable so the odds would beI'll just write odds it's three to threewhich is one to one you could also writethis using a colon one to one okay oryou can even use it right with a word toone to one odds okay so that's oneexample let's look at the spinner overhere okay say for example the spinnerwe're going to spin it and we say wellwhat's the probability that I land ontwo well there's only one two okay theseregions are all you know the same sizeand shape so there's one chance oflanding on two divided by four possibleoutcomes the probability is going to be1/4 but if we said what are the oddsthat you land on- well one chance of landing on two -three chances of not landing on - theodds would be one two threeokay now let's switch it up a little bitlet's say we want to find out what arethe odds against landing on the numbertwo so now the odds against means wedon't want to land on two so what arethe chances that we don't land on twowell there's 3 9 2 s 2 1 2 so the oddsagainst would be 3 - 1 notice it's thereciprocal of the one that we did oddsin favor so odds in favor is what youwant - what you don't want odds againstis what you don't want - what you dowantokay now experimental versus theoreticalprobability what's the difference wellsay for example we run an experimentright we spin this spinner 100 times andout of those hundred times let's say thenumber 2 comes up 22 times okay so theexperimental probability would be 22 outof a hundred trials that's theprobability and you could reduce it downit would reduce down to 11 50s right youcan divide them both by two but what'sthe theoretical in theory what's theprobability that we land on - well onechance of landing on two out of fourpossible things that could occur rightso experimental you just think you'rerunning an experiment you're runningtrials you know you do it a hundredtimes or 20 times or a thousand timesand you count how many successes howmany things occur that you're interestedin having happen out of the total trialsand that's your experimental probabilitynow as the number of trials go up okayassuming that this is you know balancedit's these are equally spaced thespinner you know there's nothing noglitchyness to it and whatnot thisexperimental probability will likelybecome closer and closer to thetheoretical probability but who knowsmaybe there's some other factors thatare influencing you know theprobabilities in such a way that they'renot the same okay but these are thedefinitions so probability odds odds andfavor eyes against experimentalprobability and theoretical probabilityso if you're enjoyingthese videos you're learning somethingas I hope you are subscribe to thechannelI leave me a comment and I look forwardto seeing you in the next video
