welcome the Egyptians of ancient timeswith very practical people and they'revery practical in the mathematics when Iwill talk about now is Egyptianfractions and how they approach them howthe correct fractions in general solet's talk the very practical problemsuppose we have say seven pies and we'dlike to share them among 12 boys now wewould say okay just give every boys eventaught to the pie maybe tropics minus 12bits and give each person certain piecesum it just a little bit better than thatthey actually asked us okay what's thebest thing we do could we give every boyan entire pie well no it's not enoughthat pies there can we do the next bestthing but they may be a half a pie foreach boy and we can only do that solet's pull off seven house 1 2 3 4 5 6 78 9 10 11 12 so I make 12 hubs there's12 halves you sort of give each boy awhole chunk of pie as big as a halfthere is one pie left over what we dothat we store to share that amongst the12 boys I guess now the obvious thingsare just divide that into 12 which Ithink I've just failed to do because Ican't do fractions apparently andbasically we gonna say give every childhalf a pie and 1/4 of a piethey say that's better than giving smalllittle pieces of 7/12 give them as bestthat they canit's a nice practical result plus thebest next best thing you do which is1/12 so today we call any fractionthat's written as a sum of fractions ofthis form namely with numerators of 1 anegyption fraction and Egyptians actuallyspecial notation for reciprocals ofnumbers they've placed a dot on top oftheir symbols of the numbers themselvesof course they were using the cinderArabic numerals here alright so theEgyptians would say okay if I want tosay 3/10 they wouldn't write 1/10 plus1/10 plus 1/10 because there's not aspractical in the sense of giving peoplethe biggest piece as possible then say3/10 is actually a quarter the pie foreach person plus 22 the pie especiallyat the added rule that they want to eachfraction the numerator of one and theywanted all the fractions to be distinctcan make from taking the largest piecethey hand out as actually bit trickyfinding these things5/7 for example is a 1/2 plus 1/5 plus70th and they're actuallyunique I bet a little exercise for youyou could actually create a differentway of breaking 5/7 there's somedistinctive unit fractions and theselection size go for it so what I'dlike to do now is go to a questionactually Fibonacci asked some twothousand years later in 1200 that everynumber actually admit an egyptianfraction expression can you actually dothis for each fractions now theEgyptians didn't seem to question usthey had tables and tables of values andhow to write each numbers and ripchatsome of egyptian fractions but wherethey cannot be done for every singlefraction is actually worth askingFibonacci appears as one of the firstpeople to actually ask this and moreimportant answer it so Fibble actuallysaid yes to be Fermat if he managed tofigured a way to prove that everyfraction can indeed be written as a sumEgyptian fractions as it cool todaycourt Fibonacci is a greedy algorithmand I just plain why the word greedy isappropriate in just a second let meillustrate with an example suppose youwish to write for 13 as an Egyptianfraction now the first thing you ask iswhat's the biggest amount of pie you cangive each child so we were 13 kids andfour pies and the way I personally askedthat question I can divide the numeratorand denominator each by force and 4divided by 4 is 1 13 divided by 4 is 3and 1/4 that tells me this is justbigger than 3 that 1/3 of the pie is toobig I can't give each kid 1/3 of the piethe next best thing to do is give eachkid 1/4 the pie so I'm going to takewhat I have for 13 and see what giving1/4 the pie out leaves me ok so that'sgoing to be 1650 tooth's for the firstone and it was going to be 1350 tooth'sthat leaves me 350 tooth of pieremaining a three division problem issharing three parts of my schooldistrict kids we all now attack the sameproblem the same way 350 toothshandwriting divide top and bottom bythree one and a 17 and a third thistells me one 17th is bigger than 350tooth so the best thing to do is workwith 118 is the next best choice solet's look at 350 tooth strike front one18thsees a very mysterious algorithm crossmultiplying kanakamma denominationalthat that's 50 for over 52 times 18 orthat is minus 52 over 52 over 18 thatgives me 2 over 52 18 I can certifylittle bits 1 over 52 times 9 that'sbasically 520 - 52 I think that's onefor 68th and I think we're there I canpiece this all together and now havethat for 13 it is as mass able to take 4quarter they left me resort which Icould then rewrite as taking off an 18ththere's the 18th - drew drew but wellthat left hip behind take when 18th is1/4 68 there it is for 13th as anEgyptian fraction so Fibonacci realizedif you take this person's always beenmoving the largest fraction you possiblyif actually the largest denominatorpossibly can you will always end upresults with smaller numerator examplesstay with the numerator 4 we took offthe largest fraction we could and we'releft with the numerator 3 from 3:30 tothe motive 3 which was the largestfraction we could 118th and we're leftwith a numerator of 2 which actually putsome just reducing here leftistremainder 1 Sudi remainder of 1 thatmeans we can replace everything togetheragain and write as a sum of fractionswith numerators 1 that is an Egyptianfraction so here goes let me now provethat Fibonacci's method is always goingto work so let me just do thisabstractly now so the claim is let'schoose a green pen this time if I'mgiven a fraction a over B my job is tochoose a fraction 1/10 with n as largeas possible so that one n is stillsmaller than over B but if I went with 1over n minus 1 it wouldn't work it'd bebigger than what I can do so then when Isubtract from this one N and the claimis this will produce a fraction witheven smaller numerator all right welllet's work out this fraction on the lefthas a common denominator of B n sothere'd be a times n over B n minus Bover B inso we're gonna check two things thatthis numerator is well first of all itbetter be positive because if I startgoing to the negative numbers I'm introuble so we should check it's positivenow if you also check that it's smallerthan what we started with that issmaller than the numerator ehall right have two things to go throughwell the thing is look how we chose thisvalue n let's unravel there's a firstinequality this is telling me that B isless than a n which I could say is thata n minus B is bigger than zero bingoexactly what I wanted it is still in thepositives if I unravel the secondinequality thing with it B is biggerthan a n minus n that is a n minus nplus R a n minus B did you know I'veseen it's not more than a gosh you seeI'm very human I can't even do basicalgebra as they're telling me that a andminus B is actually less than a just asyou wanted so there we goFibonacci tip this is algebraessentially managed to prove that if youtake off the largest value of and youcan still opt out of a unit fractionyou're left with another fractionsmaller denominatorrepeat the process he we left thesmaller than already can repeat theprocess smaller dominate again as we'restaying in the integers and all we'restaying positivewe must eventually end up with thedenominator of one which case will bepiece it all back together againand end up with an Egyptian fractionexpression for the original fraction sothere it is and you see what's calledthe greedy algorithm now because of whatyou're doing is taking off the largestfraction you possibly canyou'll be very greedy which is exactlywhat the Egyptians were doing in thefirst place is very practical answer totheir problems all right thanks verymuch
