hello and welcome to the section ofcalculus extra practice with integrationin this section we want to learn how tocalculate the area that lies between twocurves right so a lot of what we'vediscussed so far has all been learninghow to calculate integrals and teachingyou that the integral is really the areaunder the curve all the way down to thex-axis but occasionally you'll be giventwo curves and you'll want to find whatis the area between those two curves sothat's what we're going to learn how todo today and the easiest way to handleit or talk about it is to draw a quickpicture so let me draw a quick littleset of you know XY axes here and let medraw a couple of things on this axis solet's first of all draw some curve couldbe any shape we'll call it f of X andlet's draw some dashed lines and let'ssay this is a and this is B so if Iasked you how do you find the area underthe curve of f of X from A to B howwould you do that well you be prettyeasy we've done that a lot all you woulddo is integrate f of X the function fromA to B is your limit of integration andthat's going to yield the area underthis curve all the way down from thecurve all the way down to the x-axisthat's what we've talked about up untilthis point now what if i gave youanother curve and i said okay here's Gof X G of X looks different I'll put Gof X here and I said how do you find thearea under the G of X curve to the xaxis between a and B and you would saywell that's easy I just integrate G of Xbetween a and B is my limits ofintegration that's going to give me thesurface area all the way from this graphall the way down to the x-axis so weknow how to find the areas under thesecurves now if I told you how do you findthe surface area between the F graph andthe geograph in other words how wouldyou actually find the surface area herethis surface area not all the way downto the x-axis but just between the twographs how do you find that right so I'mgoing to label that a let's say how doyou find that well if you think aboutif the integral of this is from thiscurve all the way down and the integralof this is from this curve all the waydown then I should be able to find thearea between them by just subtractingthe integrals but it's basically if isubtract this entire area and then I ifI take this entire area and then isubtract this area whatever it lies downhere the difference between the twoareas is going to be what's between themand that's exactly what it is andthere's really nothing else to it otherthan that concept so the area I'mdefining is a in this case I've labeleda being the region between the twocurves here is just equal to theintegral of f of X minus G of X DX andintegrate it from A to B because youhave to go along some boundary so thisis really this is really it there'snothing nothing else to it than that soyou just take the two functions yousubtract them and you integrate them nowthere's you know the couple ways youcould do it you could integrate from Ato B f of X and get the answer and thenyou could integrate G of X from A to Band get the answer and you could takethose two separate answers and you cansubtract them but you're going to getexactly the same thing that you get bysubtracting the functions and thenintegrating them because we've alreadytalked about that when you integrate twofunctions that are added or subtractedit's like integrating the first one andintegrating the second one and then justin this case subtracting 2 so this ishow it's typically written in thecalculus book but what you're reallydoing is taking the area under the firstone minus the area under the second oneand that's how you we're getting ouranswers
