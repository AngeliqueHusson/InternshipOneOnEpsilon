look at that we have some work the wholeyearOh a similar approach over hereyoufirst of all you'll notice that theradius and the slant height are almostnext notice that the top formula we havealmost PI R squared for our lateralsurface area and on the bottom we havepi r squared for our base so theformulas are almost identical except ourslant height is slightly larger than ourradius looking a little closer you cansee that if the slant height were thesame as the radius we would essentiallyhave to flat circles and it would simplybe the area of two circles so PI Rsquared plus PI R squaredthe first PI R squared is the area ofthe base and the second for the area ofthe lateral surfaceif we look at a taller cone I like tothink of the slant height as if we'repulling the center of a flat circleupward so in this case we have a slantheight that's double the radius soinstead of PI R squared for the lateralsurface we're dealing with pi times theradius times the slant height this isbecause the slant height was the radiusfor that second circle and we've simplypulled it upward therefore the surfacearea of a cone is the area of the baseplus the lateral area so for area of thebase we have pi r squared and for thelateral area instead of PI R squared thesecond radius now becomes our slantheight and that's why the formula ismodified
