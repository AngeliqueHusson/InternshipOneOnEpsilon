[Music]random walks are ubiquitous inapplications of mathematics they're inGoogle search engine algorithms areeverywhere in finance they describe allkinds of biological movement on both amacroscopic and microscopic scale let'sdive into some of the math behind them[Music]mathematician george p¨®lya like to takemorning walks through the woods and henoticed that he would regularly bumpinto the same couple just got himthinking what are the odds that thesetwo randomly walking groups bump intoeach other to answer this we're going tohave to build up a rigorousunderstanding of random walks a randomwalk is a very general type of randomprocess it always involves taking aseries of steps and the direction of thesteps is determined probabilisticallybut as we'll see during this episoderandom walks take place in manydifferent settings and according to manydifferent rules probably the most basicrandom walk is on the integers let's sayyou start at the point zero you flip acoin with one side labeled plus and theother labels - if the coin lands plusyou move right one if the coin lands -you move left one so after one turnthere's a 1/2 probability you'restanding on plus 1 and a 1/2 probabilityyou're standing on minus 1 after 2 turnsthere's a 1/4 chance you're standing onminus 2 a 1/4 chance you're standing onplus 2 and a 1/2 chance it's zero afterthree turns the odds are one a fifthminus three 1/8 is +3 3/8 minus 1 and3/8 plus 1 let's do it one more timeafter four turns the odds are 1/16 it's- 4 1/16 is plus 4 1/4 is minus 2 1/4 isplus two and 3/8 it's zero here's a fewobservations first on the odd turns therandom walk can only be on odd numbersand on the even turns it can only be oneven-numbered seconds it mostly hoversaround the middle the number 0 but thelonger you flip the coin for the moleit can spread out the probabilities of arandom walk being in a specific locationbegin to form a bell curve notice thatin the picture of the probabilitydistribution after a hundred coin flipsmost of the time she'll be between plus10 and minus 10 here's the more generalversion of that statement after n coinflips you'll usually be between minussquare root of N and plus square root ofn let's introduce some notation so thatwe can make the second observation moreprecise let fi indicate the outcome ofthe is coin flip so f1 is the outcome ofthe first coin flipf2 is the outcome of the second and soon the SI are what's called randomvariables the variables don't have aprescribed outcome they have a fiftypercent chance of being plus one and afifty percent chance of being minus oneso what's the expected or average valueof F five we calculate one half x plusone plus one half x minus one so theexpected value is zero after we actuallyflip the coin the F I have specificvalues so if your first three flips areplus one minus one is plus 1 then F oneequals plus 1 F 2 equals minus 1 and s 3equals plus one let n be some integer ifwe add F 1 plus F 2 plus F 3 all the wayup to FN together we get the location ofthe walk after n flip let's call that FNso FN the sum of the coin flips is alsoa random variable it's actually thegraph from before that look like bellcurve so s 1 which is just F 1 has a 1/2chance of being plus 1 and a 1/2 chanceof being minus 1 and s 2 the locationafter 2 flips or F 1 plus F 2 has a 1/4chance of being minus 2 a 1/4 chance ofbeing plus 2 and a 1/2 chance of being 0again these have specific values afteryou slick so if your first three flipsare plus 1 minus 1 plus 1 then F 1equals plus 1 F 2 equals minus 1 and s 3with plus 1 and s 1 equals plus 1 s 2equals 0 and s 3 equals plus 1so what's the expected or average valueof SN well it's the sum of the expectedvalue of the first and coin flips soit's zero what we just looked at is arandom walk on the integers which isone-dimensional but the whole thingworks in any dimension for example onthe two-dimensional integer latticewhich looks like a grid you start at theorigin the point zero zero and areequally likely to move up or down orleft or right for an arbitrary number Dif you're randomly walking along ad-dimensional integer lattice there aretwo times D directions to move sinceyou're equally likely to move in anydirection there's a 1 over 2 times Dchance you'll move in a specificdirection pretty much everything we'vesaid so far it's still true you're stillmost likely to be at the origin it's theexpected value and after many steps thedistribution of the random walk willlook like a bell curve but in higherdimensions so for a two-dimensionallattice the distribution actually lookslike a bell so back to polios questionfrom the beginning what are the oddsthat two independent random walks ofbeen to each other he quickly realizedthat in the case of a random walk on theinteger lattice this is the same asasking what are the odds that a randomwalk returns to its starting positionhere's two definitions call a randomwalk recurrent if it's guaranteed toreturn to a starting position call arandom walk transient if there's apositive probability that it neverreturns to its starting position in onein two dimensions a random walk isrecurrent there's a 100% chance itreturns to its starting spots in fact itwill return there infinitely many timesso that answers polios question they'rewalking along with two-dimensionalground and guaranteed to keep bumpinginto each other over and over again buta random walk on the integer lattice indimensions three and higher is transientin three or four or 100 dimensionsthere's a chance that the random walkwill escape and never return to itsstarting spot intuitively this kind ofmakes sense in higher dimensions there'smore space oroptions for where a random walk we gooff to a favorite joke amongmathematicians is a drunk man willeventually find his way homebut a drunk bird may get lost foreverthe drunk man has no preferentialdirection he's equally likely to move inall directions we call that a simplerandom walk but in general a random walkcan have a bias or a preferentialdirection let's look at this in onedimension nowinstead of flipping a fair coin you'reflipping a biased coin it hasprobability P of landing on + andprobability 1 minus P of landing on -where P is some number between 0 and 1so if P equals 1/2 we have a simplerandom walk we were just looking at butif P equals 1/4it has probability 1/4 of moving rightsand probability 3/4 of moving left soit's 3 times more likely to move leftand right the smaller P is the moreaspires to the left the bigger P is themores biased to the right before weexpect our random walk to hover near 0but now it should be moving let's lookat a similar computation as before tofind out the expected value of one coinflip with probability P the coin flip isplus 1 and with probability 1 minus Pthe coin flip is minus 1 so the averagevalue of the coin flips will be 2 Pminus 1 where will it be after n stepslet's compute the expected value againit's the sum of the expected values ofthe end slips so it's n times 2 P minus1 for the sake of example let's assume Pequals 3/4 that means there's a 3/4chance of moving right and a 1/4 chanceof moving leftso 2p minus 1 equals 1/2 so after 10movesyou'd expect to be at plus 5 and after100 moves you'd expect to be a plus 50you're moving to the right with speed1/2 so 2 P minus 1 is like the speed ofthe walk but the random walk isn't goingto move at exactlythat feed it will fluctuate around thataverage just like the simple random walkfluctuated around zero while the speedof the walk is similar to n thefluctuation around that average aresimilar to the square root of n sothere's really two speeds happening herethe average speed at which is movingwhich is like N and the speed at whichis fluctuating around that average whichis like the square root of n I want topoint out for folks who saw our episodeon Markov chains that a random walk isan example of a Markov chain rememberthat a Markov chain was a set of stateswith arrows connecting them that told ushow likely you are to jump from onestate to another in that episode we onlylooked at Markov chains with finitelymany states but a random walk from theintegers is an example of a Markov chainwith infinitely many states each of theinfinitely many integers is a state andthe probability transition functions aregiven by the equation probability ofjumping from X to X plus 1 equals P andthe probability of jumping from X to Xminus 1 equals 1 minus P random walksare everywhere they're not just on theinteger lattice you can randomly walkthrough a graph like this a computer canrandomly walk through websites which isbasically what Google search algorithmis doing you can modify a random walk onthe integers by requiring that it stopsif it hits plus 10 or minus 10 what'sknown as scan blurs ruin a model of asimple gambling game you can also userandom walks to model the stock marketthere's an endless number of interestingrandom walks what's your favorite let usknow in the comments see you next weekon infinite series hey y'all it's timefor the annual PBS Digital Studiossurvey how did PDFs react to the nearly40,000 responses they got last year bycreating this show you all asked for amap show and you got it so what do youwant to see on YouTube in this upcomingyear there's a link in the descriptionto the survey it should only take 10minutes to fill out and 25 randomlyselected participantget PBS t-shirts we're excited to hearwhat you're thinking let's talk aboutyour responses to picks theorem theformula for finding the area of polygonswith vertices on the integer latticefirst Jonathan Casio has an excellentcorrection he says and you're proof thatplanar graphs have Euler characteristic2 I think you missed a stepsince we're allowing loops on a singlevertex we need to consider whether theedge we pick is a loop or not if it'snot the logic works fine contraction ofthat edge removes one edge and one nodeand we're fine but if it's a loopcontraction of that edge removes oneedge and one face this is still finefaces and edges can cancel out too butthe argument is subtly different betweenthe two cases thanks for pointing thatout Jonathan Petros a Demopolisresponded that this method is actuallynot the simplest for a computer and thensuggested a method for a computer tofind the area of a polygon this made mecurious does anyone know other methodsfor a computer to find the area of apolygon what about arbitrary shapefinally meiosis drew our attention tothe shoelace formula which i've neverheard of before it also finds the areaof a polygon in a neat way thatmultiplies the vertex coordinates in aweird crisscross pattern hence the nameshoelace formula go check it out see younext time[Music]
