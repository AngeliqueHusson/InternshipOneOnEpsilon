so when trying to go through a problemwhat's the difference between a polygonthat's concave burst complet convex whatwe need to do is again just look at lookat two figures okay so we have a figureit looks like thatso what we need to do is determine whichone of these are going to be concave andwhich one is going to be convex allright so ladies and gentlemen to do thatwhat we're going to do is we're going toextend the exterior lines the lines thatmake up our polygon okay you guys seeI'll get that now when I take thoselines and I extend them that what's whatmade my polygon do any of those linesintersect inside the polygon no sotherefore we call this a convex polygonbecause when you extend the lines of thepolygonnone of them intersect the interior ofthe polygon however if I was going towork on this polygonyou guys can see so far it's convex butnow when I go through these lines youcan see that my lines now intersectinside of the polygon so this is what wecall con K and the easy way you guys canalways think about is this cave think ofcave as inside right cave inside goingin through so whenever you havesomething that is going to have linesare going to intersect inside thepolygon it's going to be concave allright so what you guys had to do for you
