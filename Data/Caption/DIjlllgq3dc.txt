To win a particular lottery
game, a player chooses 4numbers from 1 to 60.Each number can only
be chosen once.If all 4 numbers match the 4
winning numbers, regardless oforder, the player wins.What is the probability that the
winning numbers are 3, 15,46, and 49?So the way to think about this
problem, they say that we'regoing to choose four
numbers from 60.So one way to think about it
is, how many differentoutcomes are there if we choose
four numbers out of 60?Now this is equivalent to
saying, how many combinationsare there if we have 60 items?In this case we have 60 numbers,
and we are going tochoose four.And we don't care
about the order.That's why we're dealing
with combinations, notpermutations.We don't care about the order.So how many different groups of
four can we pick out of 60?And we don't care what order
we picked them in.And we've seen in previous
videos that there is a formulahere, but it's important to
understand the reasoningbehind the formula.I'll write the formula here,
but we'll think about whatit's actually saying.So this is 60 factorial over 60
minus 4 factorial, dividedalso by 4 factorial,
or the denominatormultiplied by 4 factorial.So this is the formula
right here.But what this is really saying,
this part right here,60 factorial divided by 60 minus
4 factorial, that's just60 times 59, times
58, times 57.That's what this expression
right here is.And if you think about it, the
first number you pick--there's 1 of 60 numbers, but
then that number is kind ofout of the game.Then you can pick from 1 of
59, then from 1 of 58,then of 1 of 57.So if you cared about order,
this is the number ofpermutations.You could pick four items out of
60 without replacing them.Now, this is when you cared
about order, but you'reovercounting because it's
counting differentpermutations that are
essentially the samecombination, essentially the
same set of four numbers.And that's why we're dividing
by 4 factorial here.Because 4 factorial is
essentially the number of waysthat four numbers can be
arranged in four places.Right?The first number can be in one
of four slots, the second inone of three, then
two, then one.That's why you're dividing
by 4 factorial.But anyway, let's just
evaluate this.This'll tell us how many
possible outcomes are therefor the lottery game.So this is equal to-- we already
said the blue part isequivalent to 60 times 59,
times 58, times 57.So that's literally 60
factorial divided byessentially 56 factorial.And then you have your 4
factorial over here, which is4 times 3, times 2, times 1.And we could simplify it a
little bit just before webreak out the calculator.60 divided by 4 is 15.And then let's see, 15
divided by 3 is 5.And let's see, we have a
58 divided by 2 is 29.So our answer is going to be 5
times 59, times 29, times 57.Now this isn't going
to be our answer.This is going to be the number
of combinations we can get ifwe choose four numbers
out of 60 and wedon't care about order.So let's take the calculator
out now.So we have 5 times 59,
times 29, times 57.It's equal to 487,635.So let me write that down.That is 487,635 combinations.If you're picking four numbers,
you're choosing fournumbers out of 60, or
60 choose four.Now, the question they say is,
what is the probability thatthe winning numbers are
3, 15, 46, and 49?Well, this is just one
particular of thecombinations.This is just one of the 487,635
possible outcomes.So the probability of 3, 15, 46,
49 winning is just equalto-- well, this is just one of
the outcomes out of 487,635.So that right there is your
probability of winning.This is one outcome out of all
the potential outcomes orcombinations when you take 60
and you choose four from that.
