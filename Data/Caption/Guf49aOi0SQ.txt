in the previous video we saw thetriple-s condition for similarity inthis video we will look at the triple-acondition and the letter a obviouslymeans angles of the triangles let's drawtwo triangles for our reference triangleABC and triangle PQR let vertices ABCcorrespond to vertices PQ R so thetriple a condition says that if themeasure of this angle is equal to thatof this angle and if this angle equalsthis one and if this angle equals thisone then these two triangles will besimilarremember the correspondence acorresponds to P B corresponds to Q andC corresponds to R so the triple-eightcondition in this example can be writtenas if angle a is congruent to angle Pand angle B is congruent to angle Q andangle C is congruent to angle R thentriangle ABC will be similar to trianglePQR so this was the Triple A conditionif all corresponding angles arecongruent then the triangles are similarthe converse of this is also trueconsider the triangles ABC and PQ arethe converse says that if triangle ABCis similar to triangle PQR then angle awill be congruent to angle P angle Bwill be congruent to angle Q and angle Cwill be congruent to angle R so theconverse of Triple A condition says thatif the triangles are similar then thecorresponding angles are congruentyou
