welcome in this video hello should havebeen little tidbit from threedimensional geometry about a shape thatsummer between being a cylinder and acone and talking about its volume thishas come up in recent conversation so Ithought I'll make a video about it okaysoldier let's do that first a cylinderis given by choosing some shapes andfigure in the plane and I'll dosomething sort of like a halfway betweenbeing a polygon and a circular shape andmaking a congregate a plane parallelabove it and then connecting each edgeeach point on saw it on matching edgesto make a three-dimensional object as soand a cone is a similar constructedstart with a figure in one plane choosea point directly above it in the planeabove it and make a circus tent to cuttype construction by connecting eachpoint on the boundary of the bottomfigure with a live so much of thatcurrent point and that makes a circustent now let's see it is well known thatthe volume of these things is given bywell the volume of thunder is the areaof the base which or to say is a times Hwhere H is the height of the object anda is the area of the base oh that's thebasic definition of volume to begin withover what we mean by cylinder in aprevious video I proved without calculusthan this video I'll use calculus tomake my life a little bit easier andquicker that the volume of any cone isactually going to be exactly which isquite surprising one-third of the areaof the cylinder in which it sits so whatI've got here is the volume of acylinder is 1 times area times basetimes height and the volume of the coneis one-third times area base area basetimes the height well I'd like to knowis there some object that's in betweenthe two there's actually half area ofbase times height and the thing is thereis such an object and that's why I liketo describe here it's going to be simpleto construct I don't think of somehowhow do I what's what's halfway betweenhaving a top base that's the full figureto a top base that's just a point butwhat I really did here to construct acone has took this whole top base of thecylinder and pinched it to single pointso he pinched it from left to right andfrom back and forthso the pecan strict they'll be halfwaybetween that operation and not doing itat all will be not pinching it both leftand right and back and forth to a singlepoint just pinch it in one direction tomake a line segment it's gonna be a bittricky for me to draw when we go for itso let's pinch it so that the top is nowpinched whoops need my pen to a linesegment I have the same base as beforedue to do and what we do is now connectpoints on that line segment two pointson the boundary of the figure to createsome object that in some sense really ishalfway twixt the two I claim the volumeof this beast is a half way half thearea the base times the height now ifyou look at my video on how I prove thevolume for the area of a cup for me forthe volume of a cone I did it withoutcalculus actually used basicallyArchimedes techniques there is actuallya way to do what about to do usingArchimedes techniques as well and i'llleave that as exercise can you justmodify my proof for this shape in thatprevious video for this middle shapedoable but what I'll do now is I assumewe have some calculus under a belt andI'll prove that this is the correctvolume formula using calculus ok hascalculus go well calculus is the volumeof a shape is given by integrating crosssection areas so four cylinder the crosssection areas don't change any level onthis shape the area is always a now justto make my life easier let's call thistop level zero this assumes is goingdown X units all the way down to H unitsso that set then says that the volume ofa cylinder is going to be the integralfrom zero to H of the cross sectionintersection area which is just a DX soit's a X 2 X 0 and H 7870 that's just ah indeed this is the volume of acylinder for cone this is going fromagainfrom 0 to X all the way to H and eachcross section area which I guess I'mdrawing in red now if you think about itit's just going to be a scaled copy ofthe base now what's the scale factorwell scale factors actually is goingfrom 0 to 8 so actually scale factor isX over H and area changes by a scalefactor squared so that means the area ofthis cross section at level X isactually area times X over H squared sothe volume of a cone is going to begiven by integral from zero to H of thecross section section area DX and now wesee why a third comes in becauseintegral of x squared is one-third of Xcubes have an 870 I'll get one-third a hcubed over H squared H Squared's cancel13 h well now we have it you can imaginewhat's going on here for this strangeshape whose name I do not know but hedoes have a name in some sense we'vedone something strange to it we've takenthe cross section area and squished itin brought it in perpendicularly to thedirection of the line segment here forthe point we're shrinking for thecurrent we're showing you all the way toa point from all directions over scalefactor is X over H squared I claim whatwe're really doing here is a scalefactor of just X over H all right soskip it again except H but just there'san area changes by that scale factorthat is I go explain this I claim thearea at liberal x is just given by thatin which case I'm true if that's rightthe volume will be integral 0 to H of ax over HDX then I'll see the hath comedown a h squared over H a half aah soI'll explain why is the area of a crosssection at level X just going to be Xover H well su that's not too hard tosee and I just need some more space todo that just it up to done boot it'sgetting very messy that's actuallyprobably very bad video sorry about thatbut well there we gothis is essentially what we've done I'vegiven ourselves a shape whoops that willneed a pen there's a shape with someline segments in it and what we're doingis we're squishing the shape down xfactor so we're reducing all the heightsa little bit and I want to know how hasthe area changed or if I was changed bya factor K in this case okay was X overH that's how far down from zero to 80went if I do a calculus idea each ofthese little rectangles has gone from acertain height one value to a heightthat's just K times as high I've gonedown so this this length is whateverlength was here is now just K times thelength the width of this rectanglehasn't changed still the same with soall I'm doing is I approximately the earis a strip of rectangles thistransformation is only just changing theheight of the rectangles not change thewidth of the rectangles and thereforethe area of it each rectangle ischanging literally by K only k naught Ksquared and you know if i take the areaas a whole which would be some sort ofyou know the limit of the areas of theserectangles taking final final rectanglesif their heights are only changing by Kthat means the area is only changing byK so yes so if I'm only squishingsomething in one direction with thescare factor K the area that object isonly changing by K which means thevolume of this beast is indeed one halfa times H alright so challenge for youfind an M and a Mickey Archimedean typeway of proving this so you might see myvideo on the volume of a cone and thenhere's my second challenge for you so wehave that the volume of a cylinder heregoes my pen volume of cylinder is areaof base times height volume of a cone isone third base times height falling movemy strange object here is one-half basetimes height well what object goes inthis line at three-quarters base timesheight what object goes here at say ohno two and a half sixths base timesheight in fact can I make sense of anyfraction I desire twixtor oh and onethird to create a nice geometric objectwhose volume is given by that fractionof the cylinder and why stop at a thirdis there something who's in a verynatural way has it volume on quarterbase times height good fun things tothink about
