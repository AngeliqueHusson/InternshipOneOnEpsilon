go ok welcome good afternoon today we'regoing to be doing absolute valueequations ok are you ready to start okby request yay alright the firstextended uh uh both words good job heynevermind alright so let's begin thisshould be relatively short so I thinkyou'll appreciate that I think it'll befairly straightforward so absolute valuewhat is absolute value do yes it makesit cause it makes any number positivewhat if the number is already positiveis still positive right on good so canyou think of a possible value for x thatwill work here anyone yes well 12 wouldwork let's try if X was 12 it will be 12plus 6 absolute value of 12 plus 6 isabsolute value of 18 absolute values 18is 18 I'm actually going to write xequals 12 here all right can anyonethink of another value yes negative 24negative 24 why because it needs toequal 18 18 what needs to equal Asia soI'm gonna circle this in red soeverything inside here needs to beeither negative 18 for positive ageingand the reason why is that if it becamenegative 18x plus 6x plus 6 can eitherresults in the number 18 that's this oneup here because that would be theabsolute value of 18 or X plus 6 canresult in negative 8 is that will be theabsolute value of negative 18 and what'sthe absolute value of negative 18anything aging so that works so we cansolve this by subtracting 6 on bothsides and we have x equals negative 24 1and 2 we can check them both where tocheck the 12 if we check negative 24here plus 6 is negative 18 I was thevalue of negative 18 is 18 ok anyquestions on that one alright surprisefor you here scroll well wait I gottarace next problem three times absolutevice X plus 6 equals 36 we need tosimplify first what should we do to bothsides yeah yep / 35 or three good so I'mgoing to do that yes that's definitelyunderstandable a lot of people do thatbut the reason why we don't is becauseyou recall in the last problem weactually create two equations so thethree would have to multiply it by bothof those remember before we had X plus 6equals this X plus 6 equals that so nowwe have a 3 here so it have to multiplytwice better than that we can justsimplify by dividing 3 on both sidesthis cancels leaving absolute value of xplus 6 equals as wellnow what can x + 6 result in this stuffon circling here yes well what can x + 6result in 12 so i'm going to write it x+ 6 can result in 12 or X plus 6 canresult in negative about this process iscalled bifurcating bifurcating soundslike like a mathematician breaks up withtheir significant other or something Ibifurcated last night you know I didn'twork out listed on facebook likes I faceI boy forget it what relationship statusquite for good oh my god you guys arelaughing your math humor Oh give yourespect ok so we solve both and someplease subtract 6 on this one leavingwhat x equals 6x equals 6 here subtract6 on this one leaving what negative 18alright and then we can plug in both toverify let's go ahead and plug it heresix plus six is twelve absolute value1212 volunteer to plug in negative 18yer yeah go ahead negative 18 plus 6 isnegative 12 have some value of negative12 12 so that works as well I don't ok Ihave one question please can't you uhtake the absolute value equation and doX plus 6 is equal to 12 and X minus X isequal to flow that's a really goodquestion all right and the reason why wecan't do that is because the way off thevalue works so you have to apply to thewhole equation yeah yeah I mean negative6 minus a negative X minus 6is equal to 12 and I was our being yeahso if you wanted to bring this negativeto the whole thing that you make nowwithout solving the whole thing bydividing by 3 on both side is theirawful to do it up there also oh hereyeah so you do negative negative 3x nonegative wouldn't be negative max whichis next times three alright negative Xminus 6 yeah so that there will benegative X minus 6 and three with hitboth of those so then you're doing itfrom the reverse angle just fine but forthe same reasons why yeah this is theother the positive version of this wholenumber with a negative version of thiswhole number because absolute value willremain positive take this down all rightso let's try to do this magic we scrollstop Oh smart board let's have some funwhoa that's in part higher higher higherMatt town dude sorry I mean not domyself that's me so 3 t minus five is anabsolute value 3 t minus five and resultin what positive to chief bifurcating 3tminus 5 a result in what else isnegative 2t because if this stuff thatI'm circling in here 3t minus five ifthat resulted in 2g I'll be the absolutevalue of two T which is 2g or if thisstuff resulted in negative 2t i'm goingto put it in here negative 2t would bethe absolute value of negative 2t whichis also positive GG so these this againto equation breaking up is calledbifurcating question please um if 3tthen just goes intothat wouldn t just equal five yeah yeahyou're solving now now we can solve soyou said something to the effect of thistrying to isolate the t's on one side ofthe equation resulting in what's left onthe left side now your Amazon negative 5yeah over earlier today to G minus 3t isnegative t.t resulting in 50 x what's upthat's only one way you have to do theother you have to do both of coursethere's two answers in this situationokay so we have T equals 5 can plug incheck and raise this up 325 so we canplug in check if t equals five volunteerclub right it would be 15 9 s minus fiveis ten absolute value of 10 of 10 10 2times the genocide so tan equals 10 soit works there can you do what to bothsides on this one your specialty are wesubtract in 3d sure let how I say yourspecialty is it right that's on some T's95 equals
