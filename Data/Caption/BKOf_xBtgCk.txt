so here in this video we're going tolearn how to find the perimeter of anyshape and to find the perimeter of anyshape you do not need to memorize anyformulas the only thing that you need todo to find the perimeter and I wrotethis for you in black is you need to addall the sides of the shape so let's seehow this works by doing a few examplesso first let's get started with thistriangle example here in blue here wehave an isosceles triangle which meansthat two sides have the same length asyou can see I marked the left side andthe right side with these little dashmarks which means the left side and theright side have the same length so ifthe left side of the triangle is 6inches we know that the right side ofthe triangle is also 6 inches and like Isaid before to find the perimeter theonly thing that we need to do is add allthe sides so we know that the left sideof the triangle is 6 inches we know thatthe right side of the triangle is also 6inches and we know that the bottom sideof the triangle is 3 inches so now we'regoing to add all these together to findour perimeter in our perimeter is equalto 6 plus 6 which is 12 and 12 plus 3which is 15 inches so now let's move onto our second example which is a squarehere we know that our bottom side of thesquare has a length of 2 feet and wealso know that a square has all sides ofequal length so if the bottom side is 2feet then we also know that the leftside is 2 feet we also know that the topside is 2 feet and the right side isalso 2 feet and once again to find theperimeter we need to add all the sidesso our bottom side is 2 feet our leftside is 2 feet our top side is 2 feetand the right side is also 2 feet and ifwe add all these together our perimeteris equal to 2 plus 2 which is 4 4 plus 2is 6 and 6 plus 2 is 8 feet now movingon to our last example here we have arectangle with a bottom side of 8 metersand a left side of 5 meters and we knowif it's a rectangle that the oppositesides have equal lengthsso if the left side of the rectangle isfive meterslet me know that the right side of therectangle is also five meters and if thebottom side of the rectangle is eightmeterslet me know that the top side of therectangle is also eight meters now tofind the perimeter we just need to addall the sides so our bottom side iseight meters our top side is also eightmeters our left side is five meters andour right side is also five meters andif we add all these together ourperimeter is equal to 8 plus 8 which is16 16 plus 5 is 21 and 21 plus 5 is 26meters so I think many of you get theidea in order to find the perimeter ofany shape you just need to add all thesides
