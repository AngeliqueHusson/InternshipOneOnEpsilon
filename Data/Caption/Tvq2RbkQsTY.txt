okay let's now talkin the story of exploding dot forexample let's do 536 tech maybe 123 wellwhat I'd like to do is okay figure thisas the addition of the opposite becauseI actually don't believe subtractionexists to me subtraction is the additionof the opposite so what I actually meanby that so if I draw this in a 10-1machine 500 ok 500 there it is and 33 10and 6 then I'm saying please add to thatthe opposite of 123 ok the opposite of101 anti hundred the opposite of 2 tendsto anti tens of the three ones threeanti ones there we are dots and antidots at my disposalnow what happens for look at thispicture I see some annihilation tolitter example this dot in this anti dotball annihilate put great anotherdilation you bet here here and againpush I bit smudgy but there we areand look three more in our nation'sthree anti dots and three dots are likepuzzles and one my left where's four onethree in fact I look at this answer it'skind as though I just went from left toright again because I like left to rightfive take away one is for three takegreat two is 160-acre three is threefour one three four hundreds one ten andthree beautiful absolutely stunning butI know you're probably thinking that wastoo nice a problem so let me now cleanthe board and do a more complicatedproblem okay I'm back with a morecomplicated problem here goes 512 takeaway 247 well you know what I'm justgoing to do it I'm going to go left toright as I'm wanted to do okay five takeaway 3 is to 1 take away 4 is negative 32 times 7 is negative 5 there it is theanswers 200 negative 3 to negative 5done Oh crazy well this is actuallycorrect answer but I'll draw yourpicture to show it's correct federalTory is a 10-1 machine pictures thishere goes500 there we are501 10 and 2 2 ones add to that pleasethe opposite of 3 hundredths yep 3 antidots for for at for anti 10s then goesfor anti dots and 7 anti ones can dothat 6 7bingoother lien i elations you bet three antidots three dots Papa buffs annihilate1.1 Antiochus annihilate will smudgyhere but I think we're okay - and - poofand while we left with 200 yep two dotsthree anti dots three anti tens fiveanti dots five anti ones 200 negative 3tnegative five absolutely correctnothing wrong with that answers of finefine answer mathematically it's justsociety again thinks this is weirdso the real challenge now is how could Ifix up this weird answer to society sakebecause most people don't like to saynegative 3t they don't like to negative5 all right so what we do here um hmmhmm this takes some thinking what couldI do is fix this up society well theonly thing you think of right now isthis dot here we must have come from itmust have come from 10 dots over yonder10 dots must have exploded to make thatdot there ah so maybe I can go backwardsand unexplored the ScotWow ok now need a sound effectunexploded what should an explosions bethere should be something like thatthat's the sound I make I'm going toexplode this dot so that means 10 dotsover here 6 7 8 9 10 so at one less dothere now an extra tens dots therealright still correct nothing's changedhere just a different way ofrepresenting that number ah but now Iget some annihilation for example thesethree anti dots can annihilate withthree actual dots so so that reallyleaves seven dots here and I've got 170negative five sounding better still massmight leak rate I can stop there forwhat mathematics doesn't care that'sfine mathematically to society howeverlet me fix that up all right so you dothe same trick this unexploded one ofthese dots must you come from ten overhereall right so I've got one less dot hereso it's 160 and I go an extra 10 thereand let's see what 5 in I elations 5ngdots five extra dots football offootball I think I'm doing it right thatthis muddiness is not too bad leavingfive dots there 165 gorgeousgorgeous all right so they're feelingthis is different from the traditionalalgorithm that I know it is they goright to left so it's good to think thatwhy does the standard algorithm work andactually give you the same answer andwhy are they both doing the same thingcause you know all correct good math isactually good and correct but you knowI'd like to go left to right and do myunexploded at the end let me point outone thing maybe it's a compromisebetween my approach and the standardapproaches go back and do what I didleft to right and get 200 negative 3 tonegative 5 and think about what's thereright now I've got that too is really200 there negative 3 is really 3 antitens negative 30 that's negative 5 isreally actually negative 5 ones and look200 takeaway 31 and 70 take away 5 165so maybe there's something good aboutthis algorithm go left to right writedown the answer looks crazy to societybut actually it's pretty Swift workingwhat that answer isin society's language brilliant lovesubtraction this way now I think we'reonto something really cool anti dotsgrant on explosions grant what power dowe now have well let's make good use ofit as we carry on with the storyyou
