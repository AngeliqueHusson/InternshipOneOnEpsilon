welcome in about 60 ad a Greek fella bythe name of hero of Alexandria publisheda form of the area of a triangle interms solely of its side links are wenormally when we look at a triangle ifit's a b c we say its area is 1/2 basetimes height well the base can varydepending which one would look in thiscase I'm looking at base C I guess andthe height here have to be the altitudeof the triangle which is actually verydifficult to figure out especially if Ionly give you the three side lines nameyou said in like 10 12 and 13 look atthe air of that triangle good luck toyou so this fellow hero actually figureda way to work out a form of the area ofa triangle based solely on the threenumbers you've given for the side linkswhat I'd like to do is actually derivethat formula here it's not the proof isnot difficult at peppers concept leaguesextraordinarily easy the algebra thatinvolved becomes quite quite nastyoh one approach is probably theclassical purse that's available to allyoung students who have discovered bothbaricza's theorem but a keen on algebramight be to go as suppose so let me letme go for it so I'll need my pen solet's suppose we have a triangle a Iguess I'll call the base B this time C Iwill actually draw on the height whichmeans the house is going to split thebase into two parts so I'll call X andtheir minimaps be B minus X so inner thearea of the triangle is 1/2 base timesthe height though trouble's I don't wantto be working with height well what Ishall do is use Pythagoras theorem onthe left path triangle which tells methat x squared plus h squared is asquared I'll use Pythagoras theorem onthe right half of the triangle whichtell us that B minus x squared plus hsquared is C squared let me just expandthis guy out B squared minus 2b X plus xsquared plus h squared equals C squaredlook I recognize X Square + H square isup here it's a squared so it tells methat B squared minus 2 B X plus asquared is Cgo ahead let's grin that gives meformerly 4x which nation not what Iwanted I want a form of H but let's doitX would have to be a squared plus Bsquared minus C squared all over to befinebut let me substitute that back into theoriginal formula and get a format for Hfrom that does that tells me that Hsquared is a squared minus x squared I'mjust going to just save myself a littlebit of whoa let me go it back andmultiply this by 2 so that's where youcan say that 2 a is BH and square it so4 a squared is B squared H squared thereason I want to work with this womanfor area is that I can just go for Hsquared directly all right so that tellsme 4a squared is B squared times asquared but H squared more thing whichis a squared minus x squared well itgoes this is where the else becomes abit of nightmares here's my formula forX and if I secure it I get this so for asquared is all right a squared B squareddu du du du minus a squared plus Bsquared minus C squared move Missy Hanrunning over looks like just four let'sput the sort of common denominator ifit's multiplying by four I'm up easiest16a squared is four a squared B squaredminus a squared plus B squared minus Csquared squared now that's grand so thatmeans I typically now I've got a formulafor the area of a triangle if I divideboth sides by 16 and take the squareroot we've done it that's fine that's avalid version of Heroes form over himbut here it actually went a little bitfurther without the tools of powerworkers outer wasn't invented till laterand the history of mathematics butnonetheless wrote down a formulaquivered to the following hero somehowon his business papyrus or bits of sandand the bond on a sandy shore somewheremanaged of working out that thisexpression is equivalentpaintgun sorry very tedious to writing16a squared is clever fellow a plus Bplus C times a plus B minus C times aminus B plus C times negative a plus Bplus C in fact if you want if you wantto do it you can expand this out and seeit is indeed equivalent to this if Idivide everything by 16 I can divideeach of these terms by 2 and if I nowtake square roots there is Heron'sformula for the area of a triangle andthat's actually nicely nicely presentedand what most people do they recognizethat a plus B plus C's that printer thetriangle I mean what half of that sothey call this the semi-perimeterso what really happens is you've got thesquare root of the semi-perimeterand this time here is actually plus cminus 2c it's really the semi-perimeterminus C when I divide by 2 times thesenator minus B times a semi printedminus a so a lot of books will actuallypercept Heron's formula in that formthere so that's it that's how you canwork out the area of a triangle knowingnothing but its side lengths it's quitebeautiful it's quite Swift just messyalgebra a very conceptual perfume onanother exercise an algebra with thefollowing let me draw my triangle againdrew drew might be good exercise forkids in the trigonometry class a b c andlet me look at one of these angles onelearns intriguing rapture class that thearea triangle is half AC sine theta thatis the product the two side legs aboutan angle theta times a sine of thetaalso the law of cosines tells me that bsquared is actually a square for csquared minus 2ac cosine of theta well Isuggest you solve for sine theta in thefirst equation solve for cosine of thetain the second equation and use the factthat sine squared theta plus cos squaredtheta equals one if I substitute myformer precise date I'll get the area aappearing in it when I substitute myfather for Chris ninth day I'll get theside lengths a B and C appearing it thismust be some formula for the area of atriangle in terms of the original sidemakes abeaten see and if you've got thepatients in the Bella page of algebraicfacility you'll be in the end able toderive Heron's formula so as a littleexercise or maybe I'm going to be alittle bit mean here could you possiblytell me then what heroes formula saysabout the size of a triangle of sidelengths ten twelve and twenty three solittle practice put those numbers intothe formula and see what you get andthen you see being explain what's goingon all rightthanks very much
