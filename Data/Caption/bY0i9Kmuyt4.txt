okay in this video I'm gonna go throughhow to sketch do a really really roughsketch of your logarithmic functionsalright not necessarily gonna be perfectbut the point is as long as you knowwhere it's been translated across oraround the coordinate plane then it willbe helpful sometimes to just be able todo a rough sketch okay so over here Ihave our base logarithmic functionsalright in this graph right here I'vedone the log of X base B where B wouldbe greater than one so as long as mybase is greater than onealright then I know my graph is going togo through one zero and it's going to goup and to the right down here it ishugging the y-axis which makes they-axis a vertical asymptote all rightand then since I am doing a rough sketchyou know I don't really know exactly youknow the steepness or the angle at whichit goes up okay but rough enough sketchthat I am good there now I know that aslong as my base is greater than one Iknow that I'm gonna go through the point1 0 because that has to do with goingback and forth between logarithmic in Xexponential form all right you've gotthat law of exponents it says any numberraised to the 0 power is always 1 allright and that has to fit here so thatour logarithmic graphs going to gothrough 1 0 right there all right nowfor a base graph if I take this equationlog of X base B and I make that base anumber in between 0 and 1 so a fractionthe only thing that it's going to do tothe graph it's still going to go through1 0 but it's just going to kind of flipit it's going to hug that Y axis up hereas a vertical asymptote at the top andthen come down into the right there okayso there's my two basic graphs you'regoing to want to memorize with that whenthe base is greater than 1 it hugs thevertical asymptote at the bottom andgoes up and then when that base is inbetween 0 & 1 at hugs the verticalasymptote at the top and then comes downall right now basic shifting rules thatapply not only to your log where and thefunctions but to all of your functionsalright if you have a number on theinside of that function then you canshift opposite left or right you canshift your graph oppositeleft to right if you've got a number onthe outside that tells you how the graphis going to shift up or down okay now Idid throw some negatives in here anegative in front of our log here isgoing to and I've just got reflects upand down because it's really hard to dothat if you think okay this is my basegraph and then a negative just kind offlips it up and down it's kind of hardto describealright a negative on the inside therewill reflect across your verticalasymptote left to right okay so here'syour vertical asymptote alright thatgraph then would just be reflected leftto right okay so knowing your basicshifting here then that's gonna have behow we're going to do our sketches okaynow in reference to this shiftingopposite left to right or same up ordown the point that I'm going to beshifting I'm going to be shifting thepoint that goes through one zero on bothof those graphs so that's the point thatI'm actually going to be shifting allright and then if you notice thevertical asymptote is one to the left ofthat pointall right the vertical asymptote is oneleft to that point so when I shift thispoint when I start to shift these and dosome examples I am also going to shiftthe vertical asymptote and I am going tomake sure that it is exactly one to theleft of that point that I'm going toshift okay so if that's being said let'swork through about three examples wherewe sketch them okay so I guess it's justa sketch it is just a rough sketch weare not trying to get an accurate graphhere all right now what I'm gonna do isI'm going to and each one of thesegraphs I am going to start and I'm gonnado it in red I'm gonna start with apoint at 1 0 all right and I put that inred now hopefully it's showing up on thevideo that that's red because that pointis not part of the graph that I amgetting ready to sketch that's just whatI'm going to use to go through myshifting right here okay now this is onthe in side of the function so then Ineed to shift opposite left to rightfrom what I see so I see a positive 2which tells me I am going to shift left2 so I'm gonna take that point rightthere which is just my like my guidepoint that's gonna tell meship this and I'm going to shift it toto the left so there's one two that'sgonna put it going through negative onezeroall right now not only did that pointshift left to but the vertical asymptoteof this log function also shifted it isalways one to the left of my point soright there at negative two then it'sgonna be my vertical asymptote so I'mgonna go ahead and put it in alright andthen I'm gonna come back here I'm gonnatake a look at that base that base is anumber bigger than one that tells methat it's gonna hug my verticalasymptote at the bottom and then go upand to the right even though that's alittle crooked there so it's gonna hugat that vertical asymptote really closedown here it's gonna go through thatpoint and then up and to the right allright now like I said really roughsketch I don't know exactly you know howhigh and how sharp that's gonna go butat least I know now what this graph isdone it has shifted or translated to theleft - it's not right now on this onethis has got not only shifting left orright but this also has shifting up anddown as well so again I am gonna startwith a point at 1 0 alright but keepingin mind I'm putting it in red becausethat red dot right there is not part ofthat function right there same thingwith here this red dot is not part ofthe the function that I am sketching I'mjust using it as a reference point sothat I can do my moving around all rightnow I'm going to look at right insidehere this minus 2 is on the inside ofthe function so I shift opposite left orright so that means I'm going to goright to from this spot right here allright now this plus 3 then tells me thatI'm going to shift the same up or downso I see a minus 3 that means I'm goingto go down 3 so this is going to theright 2 and then it's gonna go down 3okay so I'm gonna take that point thatis at 1 0 and that's what I'm going tomove so I'm gonna go to the right 2 andthen I'm gonna go down 3 so to the right2 down 3 and that's where my point isgonna go alrightnow not only did my point shift but thatvertical asymptote is going with it aswell so since this point is sittingright here at 3 that means my verticalasymptote has to be one to the leftit'smy vertical asymptote has got to gothrough to hopefully and get this one alittle bit more straight all right sothere's my Berglas improvement it gotshifted as well all right now I'm goingto come back up here I'm gonna take alook at that base the base is a threewhich is a number bigger than one so Iknow it's gonna hug the verticalasymptote down here low and then go upand to the right and since it is a roughsketch now whether or not you know wedon't know we don't know if it's gonnago up quickly shortly really quick hereat that point all right but that's notwhat I'm after here I'm just after youknow it shifted about where is it at inmy coordinate plane and then I have thegeneral shape right there all right nowfor our last example okay again you'regoing to look at the inside of thefunction that tells me opposite left orright so I see a plus three so thatmeans I'm gonna go to the left three andthen I'm going to come out here thisnumbers on the outside of the functionit's a negative two so that means I amgoing to go down to alright now what ismoving okay the point the imaginarypoint that I'm gonna put on my graph atone zero all right as my starting pointwhich will not be part of the actualgraph but that's what I'm gonna shift soI'm going to shift this one two to theleft okay or I'm sorry three to the leftand then two down all right so one twothree left and then two down so thethree left two down puts my point righthere okay now not only did the pointshift but the vertical asymptote thatgoes with the log function also shift itis also to always one to the left sonegative one negative two that puts myvertical asymptote going throughnegative threeall right now I'm gonna come up here I'mgonna take a look at that base and thatbase is a 1/3 that is a number inbetween zero and one so that meansinstead of hugging my vertical asymptotedown here and coming up and to the rightI'm gonna hug up here to the top and I'mgonna come down and go through it makingsure that I go through is that pointright thereall right and again just rememberingthat that red dot that I initially puton the graph is not part of thislogarithmic function okay all right sojust three quick little sketches oflogarithmic functions how they shiftaround the coordinate plane and that canbe very helpful now while we're alsotalking about logarithmic functions it'sa really good time to just review ortake a look at the fact that thelogarithmic function and the exponentialfunction are inverses of each other allright so what I've done is I've justdrawn a couple pictures here thispicture on the left is pretty much themost important one because these are thetwo that you're going to work with themost all rightas you recall the exponential graphalright goes through zero one when thebase is greater than one I should knowwhen the base is greater than one myexponential function all exponentialfunctions go through zero one all rightand go up into the right all right nowthe logarithmic function when my base isgreater than one all logarithmicfunctions go through that that haven'tbeen shifted go through one zero allright it hugs has a vertical asymptotedown here along the y axis and goes likethisall right now inverses our reflectionsover the y equals x line so I've got theY over X line on here and I've got theexponential function here and thelogarithmic function here showing thatthey are reflections of each other overthat y equals x line so it's just kindof good so Sierra doing the graphs andprobably at this point that you'reworking with logarithmic functions andwhat their graphs look like you haveprobably already previously looked atthe exponential function as well nowthis picture on the right lesson commonhowever it still applies when my base isin between 0 and 1 that's when I havethat fractional base all right it justflips the graphs so that they hug theirasymptotes in a different spot all rightso here my exponential function is againgoing through 0 1 ok and with afractional base would look like thisalright kind of on the lines of anexponential decay type problem alrightand then the y equals x line is rightthere so if I were to reflect thatexponential equation over that line Iwould get thelogarithmic function where the baseagain is in between zero one hugging uphere and going through one zero allright so a couple pictures that justkind of let you easily see that thelogarithmic function and the exponentialfunction are inverses of each otherokay so sketching logarithmic functionsand then verifying the the exponentialand logarithmic functions are inversesdefinitely thanks for watching if youliked the video go ahead and give me
