today is James again so what themathematics behind his person opponentwas have you added a formula spells yourname well the best way to explain isjust to do is I'll do two examples withthese let's spell go and let's go mathfor term at all right so I'll do this upto one first let's do go just twoletters G the servant of the alphabetover the 15 so I want some forming thatgives me seven when I put an x equalsone and gives me 15 when I put x equalstwo so as I create such a formula wellI'll do two pieces once the seven onetwo 15s let me start by just right nowseven and a fifteen piece well eitherstick through what would needs to happenhere when x equals oneI want the seven piece to survive but alot the fifteen piece to go away so in Xis 1 I want this part to disappear howcan I make a piece of warming disappearfor x equals one well one way to do itis to put in a factor of x minus 1 whenX is 1 I get 15 times 1 minus 1 3 sub 0and B that piece will go away it goingto be 0 and this is 7 unaffected allright grantI thought the same things happen for the15 piece when x equals 2 those are 1 xequals 2 to have a piece 15 survived andthis piece 7 to disappear for x equals 2chata make this part disappears x equals2 let's put a factor of X minus 2 sothere's my two pieces of a polynomial itlooks like they're doing the right thingeffect let's double check let's believex equals 2 do I did get 15 7 times 2minus 2 is 0 and x 0 is they get 0 plus15 times 2 minus 1 15 times 1 0 plus 15is 15 beautiful and when x equals 1 Ishould get 7 I get to 15 times 0 1 minus1 if that piece disappears 7 times 1minus 2 negative 1 7 times negative 1I'm getting negative 7 not 7 botherokay okay let's not give up what we dohave we fix this problem up well theproblem is we've got 7 times negative 1here what does I leave this a fractionswith the negative 1 on the bottom youcan see what's going to happen then I'llget 7 times negative 1 over negative 1 afraction of the same thing is just 1 7times 1 is 7 plus 0 when x equals 1 thisformula now gives me 7 beautiful thereit is there's a formula spells go now itlooks pretty miss right now but I canmake it a little bit simpler example arethis is really what 7x is minus 14 overnegative 1 plus 15 X minus 15 or thatnegative on the bottom because it reallymakes this 14 minus 7x plus 15 X minus15 so what does that give me that givesme a 15 exoteric 7 is 8 X is 14 minus 15minus 1 there is the formula spells go 8X minus 1grand alright so what I want to do nowis give you the polynomial that skillsmath is going to using exactly the sameidea I have four pieces one for 13 1 for1 1 for 21 days and it'll raise thosepieces that they disappear at all therights what could only survive at thecorrect spots I want but then I mighthave to do some adjustments to balanceout what happens the numerator a bettercounterbalance that what's somethinggoing on the numerator denominator forme so creativity olive oilwell the write down is could be a visualnightmare but I bet because see our waythrough the visual clutter andunderstand what's going on so I'm goingto speed up the videos ago on so youhave to watch me first clean the boardand then you have to watch me wipe thewhole thing and all the right back andwe'll check that woman I broke down isreally doing what we wanted to do I wantto smell Matt right he goes bed up video[Applause]beautiful now I'm back here is myformula for the word map and I'm goingto show you that it works beautifully Ibet I do exactly the same strokes beforeit looks like a visual nightmares butactually conceptually it's just astraightforward he goes let's check Iclaim we put an x equals 1 you will getthe number 13 out of this weird form infact I've got four chunks you can seethem once the 13 one for one month ortwenty one to eight I've designed thelatter three chunks to disappear for Xfigures 1 is a factor of X minus 1disappears takes of X minus 1disappeared photo section 1 disappearsso when X is 1 order 0 all this is 0 andall this is 0 only this piece couldpossibly survive and when X actually is1 I've got 1 minus 2 1 minus 3 1 minus 4on the numerator but look 1 minus 2 isnegative 1 1 minus 3 is negative 2 1minus 4 is negative 3 so designs thedenominator to match exactly match thenumerator FX equals 1 so when X is 1 allis there so something divided by thesame something is 113 times 1 plus 0plus 0 plus 0 does indeed give me 13 ifyou check those I'll do no I'll do it xequals 3 just to make sure we've got itright I've designed it so that threefactors disappear when X is 3 but onlythis Spectre survives and x equals 3 soguess the supposed term does disappearif x equals 3 the second term doesdisappear by x equals 3 and so does thisone also disappears x equals 3 so 0 0and 0 this piece survives and when X is3 I've designed the denominators tomatch the numerator 3 take away 1 3 2 32 3 take away 3 so when X is 3 is 20times 1 and plus 20 go math look at thatnow this is a polynomial it's prettyghastly right now but I could simplifybecause I have a one time thing in 1times negative 2 is indeed just a tomake it look simpler3 times 2 times 1 is 6 it's longer thatway so I can so expanding all theseterms and give a single polynomial interms of powers of X which is going tohave some pretty ghastly fractions to itby the way but there it is we can nowsee what's going on it's just a matterof algebra they're pretty tediousalgebra to make it look likebingo that's the idea behind this thatall I was doing all along through thesepersonal polynomials and you know whatit's just fantastic stuff so indeed yougo to Massyou
