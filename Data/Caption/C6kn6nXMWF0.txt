We live in a three-dimensional worldwhere everything has length,width,and height.But what if our world
were two-dimensional?We would be squashed downto occupy a single plane of existence,geometrically speaking, of course.And what would that world
look and feel like?This is the premiseof Edwin Abbott's 1884 novella, Flatland.Flatland is a fun, mathematical
thought experimentthat follows the trials
and tribulations of a squareexposed to the third dimension.But what is a dimension, anyway?For our purposes,
a dimension is a direction,which we can picture as a line.For our direction to be a dimension,it has to be at right angles
to all other dimensions.So, a one-dimensional
space is just a line.A two-dimensional space is definedby two perpendicular lines,which describe a flat planelike a piece of paper.And a three-dimensional spaceadds a third perpendicular line,which gives us heightand the world we're familiar with.So, what about four dimensions?And five?And eleven?Where do we put these new
perpendicular lines?This is where Flatland can help us.Let's look at our square
protagonist's world.Flatland is populated by geometric shapes,ranging from isosceles triangesto equilateral trianglesto squares,pentagons,hexagons,all the way up to circles.These shapes are all scurrying
around a flat world,living their flat lives.They have a single eye
on the front of their faces,and let's see what the world looks likefrom their perspective.What they see is essentially
one dimension,a line.But in Abbott's Flatland,closer objects are brighter,and that's how they see depth.So a triangle looks
different from a square,looks different a circle,and so on.Their brains cannot comprehend
the third dimension.In fact, they vehemently
deny its existencebecause it's simply not
part of their worldor experience.But all they need,as it turns out,is a little boost.One day a sphere shows up in Flatlandto visit our square hero.Here's what it looks likewhen the sphere passes through Flatlandfrom the square's perspective,and this blows his little square mind.Then the sphere lifts the squareinto the third dimension,the height direction where no
Flatlander has gone beforeand shows him his world.From up here, the square
can see everything:the shapes of buildings,all the precious gems hidden in the Earth,and even the insides of his friends,which is probably pretty awkward.Once the hapless squarecomes to terms with the third dimension,he begs his host to help himvisit the fourth and higher dimensions,but the sphere bristles
at the mere suggestionof dimensions higher than threeand exiles the square back to Flatland.Now, the sphere's indignation
is understandable.A fourth dimension is very difficultto reconcile with our experience
of the world.Short of being lifted
into the fourth dimensionby visiting hypercube,we can't experience it,but we can get close.You'll recall that when the spherefirst visited the second dimension,he looked like a series of circlesthat started as a pointwhen he touched Flatland,grew bigger until he was halfway through,and then shrank smaller again.We can think of this visitas a series of 2D
cross-sections of a 3D object.Well, we can do the same thingin the third dimension
with a four-dimensional object.Let's say that a hypersphereis the 4D equivalent of a 3D sphere.When the 4D object passes
through the third dimension,it'll look something like this.Let's look at one more wayof representing a four-dimensional object.Let's say we have a point,a zero-dimensional shape.Now we extend it out one inchand we have a one-dimensional
line segment.Extend the whole line segment by an inch,and we get a 2D square.Take the whole square
and extend it out one inch,and we get a 3D cube.You can see where we're going with this.Take the whole cubeand extend it out one inch,this time perpendicular
to all three existing directions,and we get a 4D hypercube,also called a tesseract.For all we know,there could be four-dimensional lifeformssomewhere out there,occasionally poking their headsinto our bustling 3D worldand wondering what all the fuss is about.In fact, there could be wholeother four-dimensional worldsbeyond our detection,hidden from us foreverby the nature of our perception.Doesn't that blow
your little spherical mind?
