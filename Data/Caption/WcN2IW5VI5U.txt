so welcome to part 1 of solving the 4x4Rubik's Cube I just want to saycongratulations if you have solved the3x3 cube if you have not solved the 3x3cube I highly suggest that you learn howto do that first because the 4x4 cube issignificantly more difficult and one ofthe reasons why the 4x4 cube is so muchharder than the 3x3 is because of thecenter pieces let's take a look at thecenterpiece of this 3x3 cube now noticehow this side has a white center and itis fixed it's never going to move it'sjust one piece and it doesn't matterwhich side of the cube that you movethat white center piece is going to stayin the same position ok it doesn'tmatter which side that you move noticehow this white Center is fixed it is notmoving it's in the same position wellnow let's take a look at this 4x4 cubenotice how we also have the white Centeron this side of the cube and if we movethe outer edges of the cube notice howour Center is fixed it's not movinghowever if we move an inner layer of the4x4 cube we lose our Center okaylook at that we just moved our innerthis inner layer of the cube and we lostour white center piece ok so that bringsus to our first step in solving the 4x4cube is you need to solve for all thecenters of the cube so this will make alot more sense once we get started I'msolving it so let's just get startedright away and scramble this thing upokay so now our cube is completelyscrambled and we are going to solve forall these centers of this 4x4 Rubik'sCube and I always solve the white centerfirst it doesn't matter which one nowyou do I always pick white so I'm goingto say that this side or this center ofthe 4x4 cube is the white center of thecube all right so we have one centerpiece that's already in place so now I'mgoing to bring this white center pieceto the white side of the cube so I'mjust going to rotate the right innerlayer up to the white side of the cubeall right so now let's look for anotherwhite center piece all right so here wehave another white center piece and weneed to bring this to the white side ofthe cube so what you want to do is youwant to rotate this white side so thatthe two pieces that we have already forma vertical line directly above the piecethat we're going for all right so nownotice how our two pieces form avertical line directly above the piecethat we're going for so now I'm going tobring this center piece to the whiteside of the cube but notice when I bringbring it up I'm going to lose the twopieces that we place there from beforeall right so now I brought this to thewhite white side of the cube and but welost the two pieces from before andthey're on the right side so I'm goingto bring this to the left side of thecube so now this is on the left side ofthe cube and now I can bring the rightside back and now we haven't lost thetwo pieces that we place before allright so now let's look for the lastwhite center piece okay here it is righthere and whenever you have an L shapeyou want to place the corner of the L inthe same position where the piece we'regoing for so this piece is in the bottomright of this Center it's in the bottomright of the center so we want to placethe corner of this Lalso in the bottom right all rightnotice how the corner of the L is in thebottom right our piece that are goingfor is also in the bottom right so thesame idea that we that we did beforewe're going to use again when we bringthis to the white side of the cube we'regoing to lose these two center piecesokayso I'm going to bring this to the whitewhite side of the cube okay and we needto bring those pieces that we lost backso now I need to breed to put these onthe left side of the cube to do that soI'm going to bring rotate this so boththese white center pieces are on theleft side of the cube and now I canbring the right side back alright so nowwe have completely solved the whitecenter or the white side or the whitecenter of the cube so now we need to gofor the opposite side of light which isalways yellow for a standard Rubik'sCube I'll show you on the 3x3 here's thewhite side the opposite side is alwaysyellow so we know that this side or thiscenter of the cube is going to be theyellow center we already have one yellowpolice yellow center piece that'salready in place so let's look for somemore all rightso here we have a yellow center pieceI'm going to place it directly below thepiece that's already on the yellow sideand I'm going to bring it to the yellowside of the cube we lost the the piecethat was already correctly placed so weneed to bring this to the right side sowe can bring the left side back and nowwe haven't lost this piece that wasplaced there before all right so nowlet's look for the other yellow pieceshere we go all right so now I'm going tobring this piece to the yellow side ofthe cube just like before you want toplace the two the two pieces in avertical line directly above the piecethat we're going for so it'sready done for us notice how these twoyellow pieces are in a vertical linedirectly above the piece that we'regoing for alright so now I'm going tobring this center piece to the yellowside of the cubewe lost the two pieces on the right sideso we got to bring this to the left andnow we can bring the right side back andwe didn't lose these two yellow piecesso you get the idea I think by now onceagain we have an L on the yellow side ofthe cube so you want to place the cornerof the L in the same position as ouryellow piece that we're going for sosince this yellow piece is in the bottomleft corner of the center we want toplace the corner of the L also in thebottom left corner alright so now we'regoing to bring this yellow center pieceto the yellow side of the cube so I'mgoing to bring the left side left innerlayer upwe lost the the left side so we need tobring these two to the right and now wecan bring the left side back and wehaven't left and we haven't lost thesetwo yellow pieces so now we havecompletely solved our yellow side of thecube we haven't messed up our white sideof the cube which we already saw forbefore so now let's solve for our thirdside this side already has two bluepieces so I'm just going to call thisthe blue side of the cube alright soonce again the the two pieces that arealready correctly placed you need toform a vertical line directly above thepiece that we're going for so we'regoing to go for this piece and place iton the blue side of the cube alright andso I'm going to bring this piece to theblue side of the cube I'm going to losethese two pieces when I do that so Ineed to bring this to the right side soI can bring the left side back now I canbring that left side back and I didn'tlosethese two blue pieces and we still havethis piece on the blue side alright sosame idea as before now we have an Lokay you want to place the corner of theL in the same position as our last ourblue piece that we're going for so sincethis is in the top right corner of thecenter I'm going to place this out thecorner of this L in the top right cornernow the corner of the L is in the topright corner of the Center so I'm goingto bring this blue center piece to theblue side of the cube I lost the twoblue on the right side so I'm going tobring these two to the left now I cannow I can bring the right side back andnow we haven't lost these two bluecenter pieces all right so now we havethe blue Center solved for we have theyellow Center solve for we have thewhite Center solve for all right so nowwe've got to solve for our fourth Centerand it's really important that you knowwhich color the side is supposed to beso I like to use a white corner piece totell them to tell me which color thatthe side is supposed to be so let'slet's just use this white corner pieceright here okay we know that this sidefrom this corner piece we know that thisside has to be white we know that thisside has to be blue and from this cornerpiece we know that this side has to beorange so this Center has to be orangeso we have one orange piece that iscorrectly placed already and we need toget the remaining three orange centerpieces all right so I'm going to bringthis orange center piece to the orangeside of the cube by rotating the leftinner layer now the orange piece that welost we need to bring back so I'm goingtothis to the right side of the cube andnow we can bring the left inner layerback and we haven't lost this piece nownow we have two orange center pieces allright so let's look for the other orangecenter pieces okay they're on theopposite side of the orange here's ourorange side of the cube and the two thatwe need are on the opposite side so whatyou want to do is the same idea I'mgoing to rotate I'm going to bring thisto the orange side of the cube I'm goingto rotate it 180 degrees but now we lostthis the orange piece that was herebefore so we going to bring these twoorange pieces to the right side of thecube and now I can bring the left innerlayer back the way it was before and nowwe haven't lost this yellow or sorryorange center piece and we only need onemore so now we have an L and our lastorange center piece is on the oppositeside of the cube again what you want todo is you want to place when you have anL and the other and the other pin centerpiece is on the opposite side you wantto place it directly below the cornerall right so here is the corner of the Land this is actually all ready to placedirectly below so it's already done forus so we're going to we're going tobring this orange center piece to theorange side of the cube actually sorryit wasn't directly below the L now whatnow it is so once again I'm going tobring now it's directly below the L andI'm going to bring this to the orangeside of the cube okay so I just screwedup the right inner layer so I need tobring the right inner layer back so I'mgoing to place these two orange centerpieces on the left side of the cube andnow I can bring the right inner layerback and now we have solved our orangecenter of the cube so now we have ourorange we have our blue we have ourwhite we have our yellow I'm theopposite of orange is always red so weknow that this side has to be the redside of the cube alright so what I'mgoing to do is I'm going to bring thesetwo red pieces to the red side of thecube whenever you have two pieces thatare in a line together you want to makethem vertical you want to place themvertically directly below that the redpieces that are already in place so justlike this notice how these red pieceswhich are already in place arevertically directly above the two piecesthat we're going for all right so I'mgoing to bring these two red centers tothe red side of the cube now I justscrewed up the left inner layer so Ineed to bring the left inner layer backso I'm going to rotate these two piecesto the right side and now I can bringthe left inner layer back and now wehave completely solved every center ofthis cube we have the orange Centeryellow Center red white green and blueso now that we have solved all of ourcenters of the cube in my next video Iwill teach you how to match all of youredge pieces so I hope you enjoyed thistutorial and until my next video I willsee you later
