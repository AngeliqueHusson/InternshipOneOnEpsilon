We're asked to identify the
numerator and denominator inthe fraction 3 over 4, or 3/4.So let's rewrite this just
so it's nice and big.So let me just write
the fraction.So we have 3 over 4, 3/4.Now, they want us to identify
the numerator and thedenominator.So the numerator is just the
number on top, so thenumerator is the
3 right there.And then they want us to
find the denominator.The denominator is just the
number on the bottom.It's the 4.So if they say what's
the numerator?3.What's the denominator?It's 4, just the number
on the bottom.They could've just called this
the number on the bottom.They could've just called
this the number on top.Now to think about what this
represents, what this fractionrepresents, you can think
of it as three out offour pieces of a pie.That's how I think about it.So you can imagine, the
denominator tells us, what arewe taking a fraction out of or
how many pieces are there?So let's imagine a
pie like this.So we could draw like
a square pie.So this is what the denominator
represents.This is what the number on
the bottom represents.And then 3 says, we are
representing three of thosefour pieces.So this 3 tells us that out of
4 possible ones, I guess youcould think of it, we are using
three, or maybe we'reeating three.So you can imagine if someone
says I ate three-fourths of apie-- this would be read as
three-fourths-- they're eatingthe blue portion of the pie
if we cut it this way.If we imagine a round pie,
it would look like this.Let me draw a round pie.So that is my round pie.Let me cut it into four
equal pieces orroughly equal pieces.And if someone says I ate
three-fourths of this pie,where the 3 is the numerator,
and then the 4, and you'd readthat as three-fourths, the 4 is
the denominator, they wouldeat this much of the pie.They would eat 3 of
the 4 pieces.So this is is one piece, this
is two pieces, and this isthree pieces.So you could imagine the 4, the
denominator represents thetotal number of pieces in the
pie, and then the 3 representshow many of those we ate.
