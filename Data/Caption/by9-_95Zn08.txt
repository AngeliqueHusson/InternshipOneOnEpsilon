in this lesson you're going to learnwhat is meant by a composite shapeyou're also going to learn how to findthe area of this type of shape here isan example of a composite shape thisshape is made from a rectangle and atriangle to get the area of the compoundshape it is necessary to break the shapeinto smaller parts and then calculatethe area of each of the partsindividually first find the area of therectangle use the formula area equalslength times bread substitute the lengthand breadth into the formula which givesus six times five which equals 30centimeters squared next find the areaof the triangle the formula forcalculating the area of a triangle isarea equals 1/2 times base times heightsince we don't know the height of thetriangle we will have to work it out theheight is 8 minus 5 which equals 3centimeters substitute the value of thebasin height into the formula 1/2 times6 times 3 gives an answer of 9centimeters squared the area of therectangle is 30 centimeters squared thearea of the triangle is 9 centimeterssquared to get the area of the compositeshape add the area of the two separateshapes together the area of thecomposite shape is 30 plus 9 whichequals 39 centimeters squaredyouhere is a second example of a compositeshape this shape is made from a halfcircle and a rectangle as before we needto break the shape into smaller partsbefore we can calculate its total arealet's begin with the half circleremember the formula for calculating thearea of a whole circle is area equals pitimes the radius squaredto calculate the area of the half circlewe need to first calculate the area ofthe full circle and then divide ouranswer by 2 in this example the diameteris 25 centimeters so the radius of thecircle is 12.5 centimeters the area ofthe circle is equal to PI times theradius squaredremember we only want the area of thehalf circle so we need to divide theanswer by 2 giving an area of 245 pointthree centimeters squared now let's lookat the area of the rectangle the lengthof the rectangle is 25 centimeters andthe height is 20 centimetersthe area of the rectangle equals thelength times the breadth which equals 25times 20 which equals 500 centimeterssquaredto calculate the area of the compositeshape we must add the area of the halfcircle to the area of the rectangle 245point three centimeters squared plus 500centimeters squared gives us a totalarea for the composite shape of 745point three centimeters squaredin this example the blue shaded area isa rectangle and the white circle is ahole that has been cut out of the middleto find the area of the composite shapewe begin by finding the area of therectangle the formula for calculatingthe area of a rectangle is area equalslength times breadthsubstituting the values for the lengthand the breadth so the area is 8 times 6which equals 48 meters squared next weneed to find the area of the circle thediameter of the circle is 4 meters sothe radius is 2 meters use the formulaarea equals PI R squared which is 3.14times 2 times 2 which gives an answer of12 point 5 6 meters squared to get thearea of the shaded part of the shape weneed to subtract the area of the circlefrom the area of the rectangle 48 minus12.5 6 equals 35 point 4 4 meterssquaredin this lesson you have learned that acomposite shape is a shape which can bebroken up into simpler parts the area ofthe composite shape is found by usingthe formula for the basic parts andadding or subtracting the answers tofind the total area
