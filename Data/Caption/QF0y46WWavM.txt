conditional probability is theprobability that we're looking at whenwe are given one outcome already hasoccurred and we're trying to findanother outcome okay so imagine you arerunning in a race okay and you can sayokayfind the probability you won gold givingyou place in the top three okay theprobability of that event is actuallygoing to be higher than you placingfirst overall without knowing thatyou're in the top three because youcould have placed in any sort of realmwith that conditional statement whatyou're really doing is sort of narrowingdown the window that you're looking atand there's a formula for calculatingconditional probability and what it isis it's probability B in this littleline and basically what this is sayingis be given a so what we're told is thatevent a has already occurred and we'retrying to find the probability thatevent B happens as well okay soprobability of B given event a hashappened so this would be okayfind the probability you win gold givingyou place in the top three is equal tothe probability of both events occurringso probability of gold and top threeover the probability of just the givenso probability over top three okay itlooks a little bit complicated on thesurface but really if you can justremember this formula it's prettystraight forward and how you actuallyuse it okay sometimes what you see ismultiplication you can multiply bothsides by the probability of a that'swhat you end up with is a probability ofa time's the probability of B given a isequal to the probability of a and Bthat's perfectly fine just standardnumeric multiplication this is just anumberyou can cross multiply and the statementwill still be true okay so the generalform for conditional probabilityprobably a probability of B given a isequal to probability of a and B overprobability of a
