Hello.I'm Professor Von Schmohawk
and welcome to Why U.In the last lecture we saw that any fraction
can be converted to a decimal numberby simply dividing the numerator by the denominator.The result of this division will be a decimal
number which is equivalent to the fraction.This decimal number will either terminate,meaning that it can be represented with
a finite number of digits,or it will have one or more digits
which repeat forever.In this lecture, we will see how to convert
any terminating decimal numberback into a fraction.Remember that each digit in a decimal numberrepresents a value ten times that
of the digit to its right.Now if we take any decimal number
and multiply it by ten,each digit is shifted one column to the left.We have increased the value of each digit
by a factor of ten.This is also true when there are digits
to the right of the decimal point.For example, the decimal equivalent to
the fraction one-eighthis zero point one-two-five.If we multiply this number by ten, each digit
is shifted one column to the left.If we multiply by ten again, each digit is
shifted one more column to the left.And if we multiply by ten a third time,there will be no more digits
to the right of the decimal point.We will have an integer.So by multiplying our decimal number by ten
three times,which is the same as multiplying by one-thousand,we have produced an integer which is
one-thousand times the original number.If we then divide this integer by one-thousand,
the result will be equal to the original number.So zero point one-two-fiveis equivalent to the fraction
one-hundred-twenty-five one-thousandths.Now, using the techniques we learned in our
lecture on reducing fractions,we can simplify this fraction to one-eighth.So we have converted the decimal number
zero point one-two-five,to the fraction one-eighth.We can use this same techniqueto convert any decimal number with
a finite number of digits to a fraction,by multiplying it by ten enough times
to produce an integer,and then dividing the integer by
the same amount we multiplied by.If the number we are converting also has digits
to the left of the decimal point,we just separate it into an integer, plus
the digits to the right of the decimal point,and then convert the digits on the right
into a fraction.We can then combine the integer and the fraction,
to create a mixed number.So far we have seen how to convert any
decimal number with a finite number of digitsto a fraction.In the next lecturewe will see how to convert any decimal number
with infinitely repeating digits to a fraction.
