okay I have a serious confession to makeI've been pulling the wool over youreyes all the time this long division inbase X actually has a serious problemI'd be choosing very nice examples thathas happened by coincidence to workactually I've been kind of lying allthis time it's not as magical as itlooksfor example let me show you this problemI'll show you what I've been avoidingall this time let's try something like Xcubed minus 3 X plus 2 divided by X plus2 you see what I've been sneaking allthis time negatives all right so I candraw it I'm going to draw the top linethat'll be an X cubed and there being noX Squared's but it'd be 3 anti X's 4 3anti dots and 2 grand I'm in an X 1machine alright let's see and I'mdividing by X plus 2 what does X plus 2looks like one dot and two dots and thequestion is can I see any one dot nextto two dots anywhere in this picture andI look at it and I week oh dear I can'tI can'tso like I said I've actually beenfooling you all this time this beautifulwork of advanced high school algebra ofpolynomial division actually doesn'twork in general and yes unless unlessyou have a flash of insight some kindlet's see what can we do I don't see anyone dot next to us I mean I see one dotover here and two dots way over yonderbut that's no good I needed to be rightnext to each other so the question couldbe in smart ideas and yes actually I betyou're thinking right now not moving ormaybe I don't know but I see that onedot there is it'd be nice just wouldn'tbe nice to unexploited it make some moredots there that would be grand andthat's a very good building idea Igenerally mean that as good andbrilliant just turns out not to behelpful because it's an x one machine Xyou don't know what X is my head if Itold you the 10-1 machine I would knowto unexploded and draw 10 dots there orif I told you it was a to one machineyou know to unexploded or two dots therethe thing is you don't know how manydrop dots to draw there so it's a goodidea I didn't really mean that justturns out not to be helpfulnow truly stuck truly stuck is there anyway to move forward this one or am ilying about previously line oh ohbetting with our minds now can we makethis work or can we not that interestingchallenge
