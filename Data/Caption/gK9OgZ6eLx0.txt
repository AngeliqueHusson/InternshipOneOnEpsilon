understanding how the surface area of acylinder is derived is very interestinglook at this cylinder it has two bluecircular ends one on top and one at thebottom analyze the figure as we know thearea of a circle we can easily find thesurface area of the top and the bottomcircular ends but the important questionis how do we find the surface area ofthis curved surface let's zoom out a bitfirst let's separate the circular endsthis is the top one and this is the oneat the bottom to understand the curvedsurface we cut it open vertically whichwill make it look like this we just cutthe surface vertically when this isopened up further it will look like arectangle there are a few questions weneed to ask ourselves here first what isthe length of the rectangle and secondwhat is its breadth if you lookcarefully you will notice that thelength of this rectangle is actually thecircumference of the circular basebecause all we did was pull this openwhat about its breadth its breadth isthe height of the cylinder let's assumethe height of the cylinder is H and theradius of the circular base is R so thebreadth will be H and the length will be2 pi R don't forget the area of thisrectangle will be the curved surfacearea but we need to find the totalsurface area of the cylinder the surfacearea will be the sum of all these threesurfaces two circles and the curvedsurface which is the rectangle the areaof the circular base is PI R squaredsince there are two equal circles wewrite PI R squared plus PI R squaredthis covers the surface area of the topand the bottom surfaces andarea of this rectangle will be lengthmultiplied by breath which will be 2 PIR multiplied by H this 2 pi RH isactually the curved surface area of thecylinder adding these like terms we get2 PI R squared and we write 2 pi RH asis 2 pi R is common to both the terms sowe write the final formula as 2 PI Rmultiplied by R + H if we are given theradius of the base and the height of thecylinder using this formula we can findout its total surface areayou
