now let's draw three circles and genericcircles that are separated like this inspace given a pair of circles forexample large and middle you can draw acommon tangent to those two circles likeso and like so to be precise we aredrawing two outer tangents because youcan cross these like this a tangent andtangent to the inner tangents that crossbut let's talk about the outer tangentsand those two other tangents be thesecircles are usually of different sizeswe'll meet at the vertex or tip whichI'll mark black dot and because they'rethree pairs large and middle middle andsmall and small large there are threepairs of tangents and the theorem isthat if you take the tip of the firstpair heap of the second pair of tangentsand tip of the third pair of tangentsthey are all aligned along the straightline what the chance is the threearbitrary points on a plane alignedalong the straight line zero but in thiscase they do align very very beautifullyalong a straight line this theorem goesback as far as I know to Frenchmathematician engineer called Monch oneof the founders very cool technique inParis and he was very famous fordescriptive geometry and humbly andablai so the how to move a pile of stufffrom here to there minimizing energy andcost and that kind of research but healso has a few contributions inelementary geometry like this and thisis improvable by different methods forexample minerals and so forth we'll doit in a classical method but there's avery very beautiful approach which againhas to do with lifting the whole pictureto the three dimensions instead of thosethree circles let's imagine that theseare actually pictures of three spheresas seen from above please imagine thatthose three spheres are sitting on thesame table in other words their centersare different heightslarge one will be lifted a lot and thesmall one will be lifted only a smallamount the middle one a little middleish but they're all sitting on the sametables given say a large bowl and themiddle ball you candraw a common tangent cone so cone likean ice cream cone so something thatsurface like this which sort of expandsand which so the shrink shrink shrink toa tip and if you look at that picturefrom above you see what we saw beforethat is two circles and pair of commontangent lines and the tip so you caninterpret that picture as actually athree-dimensional picture but see in twodimensional appearance okay and becausethere are three balls large and middlewill have a cone and the tip middle andsmall will have a cone and tip and smalland large cone on tip you have threetips of those three cones on the otherhand please imagine again those threespheres sitting on a common floor andnow if you please take a transparentceiling from above and just tilt it tiltit and just lower it so that it touchesthose three spheres at the same timefrom above you have to tilt it yeah it'snot you can't be horizontal you havethetan it touches those three spheres atthe same time so you have now a ceilingwhich touches those three spheres fromabove and the flow which touches thosethree spheres from below each of thosecones that we talked about for examplethis cone between large and middle fearwell it's touching this ceiling and thefloor at the same time this cone so thetip of this cone is inside the ceilingand inside the floor at the same timeokay and the same goes for the other twotips so all those tips of the cones inthe top plane that is the ceiling andthe bottom plane that is floor at thesame time but you know those two planesin space intersect along a straight lineso we have just shown that those tips ofcones along a straight line and whichwhat is that straight line it's theintersection of the ceiling that we putfrom above and the flow on which you putthe bolts and if you look at thatpicture from above you see this pictureso that dotted line is the intersectionof the seedings which is tipping likethat and then the flow which issupporting the thingyou know you can also see a cartoon youjust lift this and and that's theseeding pie primetime you know then theflow is pie and then the common conetangent cone to these two spheres islike that and tip is lying in theintersection intersecting line betweenthe ceiling and the floor okay so bylifting the this complicated problem tothe third dimension the problem goesaway in fact if you look at it the rightway you know there used to be one ofthose interesting pictures where youlook at it with some out-of-focus sightsuddenly it jumps out to you into a 3dand it's a bit reckless if you look atit the right way you can start seeing itlike a three-dimensional picture andthen the theorem is clear there is noproblem I mean of course these threepoints must be on the same line becausethat's how I seethis is actually a sequel to a previousvideo with the professor aboutearthquakes and spheres hopefully you'vecaught that one too or if you just wantto see more videos with the professorclick on the link that's on the
