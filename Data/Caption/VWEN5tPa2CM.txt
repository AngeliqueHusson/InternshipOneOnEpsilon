hi welcome to math antics in this videowe're going to learn about an importantmath concept called rounding to help youunderstand what rounding is let's thinkabout how numbers are usually used mostof the time numbers are used torepresent amounts of things like howmany miles it is to the supermarket orhow many days until your birthday or howmany students went to your high schoolhow many students went to my high schooloh about 2000 okay um but it wasn'texactly 2000 was it well no it was morelike 1900ah but it probably wasn't exactly 1900either was it well no it was more like1860 all right fine1863 you see what I did there at firstthe number used to represent thestudents in high school was a roundnumber it was a good estimate of howmany students there were but it wasn'texact the next two numbers were a littlecloser to the truth but they were stillestimates only the final numberrepresented the exact amount of studentsat the school all three of the estimatesare rounded versions of the exact countbut they have different levels ofprecision 1860 was the most preciseestimate and 2000 was the least preciseestimate so rounding a number basicallymeans making a less precise version ofit and as you can see there's usuallymultiple ways to round a numberdepending on the level of precision thatyou need a really good way to understandwhat's going on when you round a numberis to look at a number line here's 1863if we want to round it to the nearest 10we need to decide if it goes up to 1870or down to 1860 but if we want to roundit to the nearest 100 we need to decideif it goes up to 1900 or down to 1800and if we want to round it to thenearest 1000 we need to decide if itgoes up to 2000 or down to 1000 and anycase the decision was based on whichround number was closer to the originalexact number but you might be wonderingwhy would we ever want to make a numberless precise in the first place what isrounding good for well rounding numberscan often make them a lot easier to docalculations with like it would be a loteasier to quickly add 300 and 500 thenit would be to add 312 and 498 orsometimes you just don't need very muchprecision like you might not need toknow that your dog weighs 55 point eightthree to nine seven kilograms fifty fivepoint eight kilograms might be preciseenough and some numbers like repeatingdecimals or irrational numbers have tobe rounded off because we can't justkeep writing decimal digits forever okaynow that you know what rounding is andwhy we do it for the rest of this videowe're going to focus on learning theprocedure we follow to round off anumber do you remember how our numbersystem is based on digits and numberplaces each digit of a number occupies aparticular number place and each numberplace is named according to the amountit represents or counts and it'simportant to know those names wheneveryou're rounding a number because you'llusually be asked to round to a specificnumber place for example you may beasked to round a number to the nearesttenth or the nearest 100 or you might beasked to round a number off to thenearest tenth or hundredth you may evenbe asked to round to the nearest wholenumber which is another way of askingyou to round to the ones place okay sowhen you're asked to round a number thefirst step is to pay very closeattention to which number place you needto round to that number place isimportant because it represents thesmallest unit of counting that you'regoing to keep in your rounded version ofthe number in fact that number place andthe digit inside it is so important thatI'm going to give it a special name justfor this video let's call it the targetas I mentioned rounding a number meansmaking a new less precise version of itin that new number any digits that are anumber of places smaller than the targetwill automatically get replaced withXero's and in most cases any digits thatare a number of places larger than thetarget will automatically be kept thesame in the new rounded version thereare some exceptions as we'll see laterin this video so that seems prettysimple all the bigger digits you keepand all the smaller digits you zero butwhat about that target digit itself whatdo we do with that well we're going todo one of two things we're either goingto keep that digit the same or we'regoing to increase it by one if we keepthat target digit the same that's calledrounding down which might seem strangeat first I mean how can leaving thedigit the same be rounding down butremember we're going to automaticallyreplace all of the smaller places withzero and doing that makes a roundednumber smaller even if the target digitstays the same on the other handincreasing the target digit by 1 iscalled rounding up since the new roundednumber will be larger than the originalnumber all right but how do we decidewhich to do how do we know if we keepthe target digit the same or increase itby one the key is to look at the digitin the next smaller number place thedigit that's just to the right of thetarget digit if that digit is less than5 in other words if it's a 0 1 2 3 or 4then we'll leave the target digit thesame in the rounded version but if thedigit is a 5 or greater 5 6 7 8 or 9then we'll increase the target digit by1 ok so now that you know the basicprocedure for rounding numbers let's trya few specific examples here's the firstone round 24,000 623 to the nearesthundred since we need to round to thenearest hundred we first need toidentify the digit in the hundreds placethat digit is a six so that's our targetand we know that any digits to the rightof the target will be replaced withzeros in our rounded version next let'sdecide what to do with the target digitwe either keep it the same or weincrease it by one to decide we look atthe value of the next digit to the rightsince that digit is onwhich is less than 5 we round down whichmeans that we'll keep the target digitthe same in the rounded number last wejust keep all the digits and biggernumber places the same in the roundedversion there we have rounded theoriginal number to the nearest hundredand the answer is 24 thousand sixhundred let's try another problemthis one has some decimal digits thirtytwo point seven two five and we're askedto round it to the nearest whole numberthat means our target digit is in theones place we need to round it to thenearest one so any digits to the rightof the ones place we'll just be replacedwith zeros in a rounded version now todecide what to do with the target digitwe look at the next digit to the rightsince that digit is a seven we'll roundup this time that means will increaseour target digit by one and finally wekeep any digits to the left of thetarget digit the same in this casethat's just the three so we've roundedthis number off to thirty three pointzero zero zero or just 33 since we don'treally need those extra zeros after thedecimal point ready for one more let'sround 65 point seven nine nine one tothe nearest hundredth the first step isto identify the hundredths place as ourtarget that place contains the digitnine all the digits in smaller numberplaces will just be replaced with zeroin the rounded version next we need todecide if we leave the target digit thesame or increase it by one so we look atthe digit to the right of the targetit's a nine also so we'll definitely berounding up but since the target digitis already a nine raising it by one is alittle more complicated when you add oneto a digit that's already nine you needto change it to zero and increase thedigit in the next bigger number place byone so that means that our target digitwill become zero and we need to increasethe digit in the next bigger numberplace that digit is a seven so we'llincrease it to an eight the rest of thedigits in the original number will bekept the same in the rounded version soour rounded version will be 65 pointeight zero as you can see in some casesrounding can actually changedigits to the left of the target digitalso it's sort of a domino effect thatcan happen when rounding numbersif you have a lot of nines rounding canbump them all up like a chain reactionlike what if you need to round 1 million999,999 to the nearest 10 the 9 in theones place tells us that we need toround our target digit up by one butit's already a nine so we need to zeroit and increase the next number placebut that's already a nine so we need tozero it and increase the next numberplace but that's already a nine and sothe pattern continues until we end upwith two million as our final roundednumberso sometimes rounding a number is prettysimple and other times it's a littlemore involved the key is to remember therule that if the digit to the right ofthe target is less than five we leavethe target digit the same but if it'sfive or more we increase the targetdigit by one even if that causes a chainreaction with the bigger number placesall right so now you know a lot aboutrounding numbers you know why we roundnumbers and you've seen the basicprocedure in action but just watching avideo about rounding isn't enough to getreally good at it the only way to dothat is to practice so be sure to tryrounding some numbers on your own infact rounding is such an important mathskill that you should probably practiceit a lot until you've really got itmastered as always thanks for watchingmath
