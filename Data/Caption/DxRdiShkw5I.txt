among three by five and four by fivewhich fraction is greater easy as thedenominators are the same the fractionwith the greater numerator will begreater so in this case four by fivewill be greater because 4 is greaterthan 3 now between 4 by 7 and 6 by 9which is greater here we compare 4 times9 with 7 times 6and because 42 is greater than 36 we cansay that fixed by 9 is greater than 4 by7 this was quickbut hey you don't really need to do thiseither it should actually have taken youto a maximum of 3 seconds to figure outwhich fraction is greater let's see howlook at these two fractions 4 by 5 and 5by 6 look at the numerators and thedenominators the numerator has beenincreased by 1 and the denominator alsohas increased by 1 but look at it a bitmore carefully the increase of 1 in thenumerator is over 4 and the increase of1 in the denominator is over 5 anincrease of 1 over 4 means that thenumerator has increased by 25% and anincrease of 1 over 5 means that thedenominator has increased by 20% try andanalyze the situation the numerator hasincreased by a larger percentage itmeans that 5 by 6 is definitely greaterthan 4 by 5 you don't need to performany calculations at all if the numeratorhas increased by a greater percentagethen the second fraction is greater andif the denominator has increased by agreater percentage then the secondfraction will be smaller now let's goback to the previous problem to comparethese two fractions do we really need tocompare these two products the numeratoras well as the denominator have beenincreased by 2 forbecome 6 & 7 has become 9 an increase of2 over 4 is 50% while an increase of 2over 7 is approximately 30% which hasincreased more the numerator it means wehave increased the value of the fractionwe can easily say that 6 by 9 is greaterthan 4 by 7 the percentage increase inthe numerator is greater than thepercentage increase in the denominatorand that is why the value of thefraction increased let's quickly take alook at a couple of more examples whatabout these two fractions here thenumerator increased by 2 and thedenominator increased as well by twoincrease of 2 over 5 numerator increasedby 40% and the denominator is anincrease of 2 over 4 increased by 50% asthe denominator was scaled up by abigger factor the value of the fractiondecreased so 5 by 4 is greater of thetwo now let's zoom out and look at twomore fractions 5 by 4 & 3 by 2 here thenumerator has reduced by 2 and thedenominator 2 has been reduced by 2 thedecrease in the numerator is 2 over 5the numerator reduced by 40% and adecrease in the denominator of 2 over 4means it's reduced by 50% here thedenominator was reduced more as thedenominator was reduced more the valueof the fraction increased so 3 by 2 issurely greater than 5 by 4 you don'treally need to calculate the percentagein the first example it's obvious that 2over 5 is lesser than 2 over 4 same withthe second one 2 over 5 is surely lesserthan 2 over 4 the value of the fractionincreased as the denominator decreasedby a greater percentage all this alsohelps us understand another conceptlet's draw a simple number line withzero one and two consider the fractionthree by eight as it equals point threeseven fiveit can be marked somewhere here let'sadd one to the numerator as well as thedenominator and see what happensadding one to both gives us 4 by 9 fourover nine is zero point four four fourand so on it can be marked somewherehere to the right of 3 by 8 now let'sadd 1 to both again we get 5 by 10 whichis half it will lie exactly between 0and 1 what do you observe yesadding the same number to the numeratorand the denominator takes the fractioncloser to 1 remember adding the samenumber even if we add 2 to the numeratorand denominator of 3 by 8 we get 5 by 10which takes the fraction closer to 1 sothis was the case of proper fractionswhere the numerator was lesser than thedenominatordoes this hold true for improperfractions to take a fraction like 4 by 2if we add 1 to the numerator as well asthe denominator we get 5 by 3 which isaround 1 point 6 6 7 and that can bemarked here to the left of 4 by 2 if weadd 1 again we get 6 by 4 which is 1point 5 exactly between 1 & 2 we can seethat for improper fractions 2 adding thesame number to the numerator and thedenominator takes the fraction closer to1 so we can conclude that adding thesame number to the numerator and thedenominator takes the fraction closer to1you
