area is we defined area off few lessonsback remember that the quiet area anyoneremember how we defined it varies ah yeshad to do this space right it's thespace taken up by taking up on what kindof thing it's gonna be flat isn't it soI could say the area of this whiteboardbecause it's a flat theme okayso area is the space taken up by I couldsay flat but a more mathematical morespecific way to say it is when we are wehave a mathematical way to say whenthings are flat with objects a flatthrough yeah we talked about theirdimensions right so instead of sayingflat it would be more specific to say2-dimensional don't really mean it'sflat yeah so area is the space taken upby a flat object a 2d object okay nowvolume is just the same but it's whenyou add a third dimension okayso that area volume on the other handokay it's still space taken up bysomething the space yeah that's right sonow by the way there's gonna be threetouching here what won't be theequivalent would it's not flat rightwhat happens when you've got an objectthen it's not flat anymore is it'sthree-dimensionalyeah so I'm gonna put that down I thinkit's it's solid it's like you know it'sactually got some thickness to it rightso we would say someone on the boardthen a solid or three-dimensionalobject okay there you goright now we're gonna have a look at thevolume of a whole bunch of differentchase but just like we haven't reallyhad yesterday at prisms I can't wait tocarry that idea forward okay so forprisons now here I'm going to do I'mgonna try and connect together this areaand this volume idea for prisms volumeis equal to and you can put this nextpart in like big letters different colorput it in a box or something like thatokay I'll say V equals okay the area ofthe cross section we talked about crosssections yesterday I'll remind you againii what they are after a few trackersarea of the cross section times theperpendicular height okay let's unpackthis okay what's the cross sectionremember these two shapes in these aresome examples all on presumption rightwhat is a cross section how would youexplain the word the phrase crosssection to somebody who didn't know whatit meantyes yes sir you cut it in half so iguess this one didn't be something likeyeah yes okayslice it saw through it okay go acrossit and you get that shape there by theway it's pay attention we could chop itin half and that will work but actuallyif it's a prism where else could you cutitwhoa hold on I'm still I still want togo in the same direction but I can cutit at different spots I don't have to behalfway right it's a v8 the key oh yeahsorryokay so prisons I do this wonder if youlike so you see that it's anothercross-section and it's still the samerectangle I could do my mole if I do toomany it's gonna start getting confusedgood behaviorthey're all the same right if I can workout the area of that cross-section onthe front okay I have to multiply thatby perpendicular height now I'll admitthis bits a little bit confusing okaybecause here if this is thecross-section that front part that I'veshaded okay the perpendicular heightwhere is itit's actually this distance here hmmthat's weird me write that down let'ssee if we don't practice why is this theperpendicular height we had anothermeasurement before we call it we callthis fire that looks like light it's youknow up down right why would thisactually be important to anyonethroughout nineteen why might we choosethat is coming ahead and not not thisoneokay so the first thing is you know insome sense I can be anything rightbecause I can just like moving aroundrighthe's shape when I hold it like this thislooks like the height right but if Iturn it over so well this is the heightnow looks like I can kind of be anythingrightwhy did I choose this I didn't chooseany other yeah for this diagram yes butI'll talk about why I chose that in asecond more jackets for okay sure atleast in this case Howard water that isthe longest okay but like I said let mecome back to this right at the momentthis is the longest okay that's but Istill couldn't turn it over and I couldget a different height so why do Ichoose that now the key is all in thiswork here perpendicular why is thatimportantah okay so this is a really crucial ideaand maybe we might even write thisunderneath because it's so importantokaythe perpendicular height this is how youcan know what the perpendicular heightis okayit's thought it's the length or theheight or the breath or whatever that'sperpendicular to the cross sectionwe said that again that's reallyimportant the perpendicular height wecall a burr perpendicular height and notjust height it's perpendicular hikersperpendicular to the cross section sothese two cross section and puffingbehind they're kind of two halves ofthree sides of the same coin but they gotogether right so this is my crosssection I can't call this book up indetail or higher because it's notperpendicular to that face okay Elliethis one is you see that so theperpendicular height is I think I couldsave the dimension all length or finedoes matter that is perpendicular toyes okay so perpendicular let me getthis again and hopefully it'll helpperpendicular means at right anglesdoesn't it makes a nine degrees so forinstance let's choose and I can youactually have a whole bunch of choiceshere right I've got six faces you chooseone and we'll make that one thecross-section which one do you like thisone okay so this looks like they're sortof the fattest one I supposeokay so this is the the cross-sectionokay he's the way I work it out I'mgonna put the cross-section flat on theground okay for cross-sections on theground okay now what direction isperpendicular so that part is flat onthe groundokay it's gonna be going up think aboutit like a flagpole if I put a flag polehere right a flagpole is perpendicularto the ground heading straight out ofthe ground do you look at it it's at 90degrees to the ground if I drew an anglethere that's a this is I shouldn'tbother bears beforethat's a main degree angle there can yousee it okay so it's something particularokay I'll use this in a second okay sotherefore if you chose this as the crosssection put it on the ground okay andthen look up so we chose this is thecross section yeah so imagine puttingthat part on the ground and that's whywhen you look up you go in that way okayso choosing the perpendicular height isreally important and it's tricky yeahokay so what did I choose as the crosssection I've chosen this side here rightso if I put that side on the ground soactually it sort of looks like thisdoesn't it that's pretty close isn't itso I've chosen this as the cross sectionthere you go right so I'm gonna put thatpart on the groundso now what's up ups that waythat's this tall this tall plant hereokay now for this we could choose rightbut if you have a look at thistriangular prism now right you don'thave so much choicewhere's the cross technique I justwhich one's the cross-section there haveto be the triangle on the front right soyes that make sense coos yeah that'sright because if I cut it if I cut itlots of timesI'll just get another triangle see thatso that's what makes it the same shapealways right okay so which way is theheight then I'll actually say theperpendicular height which way does itgo yeah wait say it againthe longest one right it's the longestone so he's the ground so you're goingup that way in fact it's just like thisone isn't it there's the UM I should goall the way there is the perpendicularheight okay so yeah I think it's helpfuland I think that's kind of why we callit the perpendicular height and not justheight right so that you know which oneis now if you work out what the areacross section is and you can you canwork that out you multiply theperpendicular height that'll give youyour volume so let's quickly look at anexample and then I can start talkingthis is now you can go to page 218okay I'll wait I wanted to say one morethinghere we go need this guy okay now so farright we'll be looking at nice sort ofmodern shapes rectangles but actuallydoesn't matter what the shape is so longas you can work out the cross-sectionsso example here we goI mean sorry okay he go now this shapehere right that I've just created is itstill the prism what do you think wereckons it still is you reckon is stillprism I think it is - a prism how canyou tellgo back to you how do we define what aprism is let's do to make sure aboutsmall other paths right it's got facesbut there's more than that like if I ifI took off this for example I do thisit's not a prism anymore so so why isthis important okay so go back go backto yesterday right what makes it Friesena prism is you can cut it for examplelike this okay and when you when you sawthrough it and that shape is the samewhat's backwards there we go you seethat right so cross-section is the sameall the way through the shame okay so ifyou want to look at the volume it's thesame you work at the area of thecross-section you multiplied by theperpendicular for example I mean if itwas all if each block was one unitwhat's the area of the cross-section isit big enough that you can see it'sseven right one two three four five sixseven sevennow how tall is this thing again not arhetorical questionyou see it's it's five isn't it right soit's gonna be seven times five thirtyfive which I suppose if I cannot everyindividual block that's what I would getokay so so long as you can work out thearea of the cross-section you're flyingin fast sometimeshave a look for example were on page 218if you question three right have a lookat question three with me they just tellyou what the area of the cross-sectionis can you see if there is a question ifit's some leader looking shape like thatoh yeah okay you mean you mean like thislike if I talk about this scenario yepin that case number one it won't be aprison rightso then number two you don't do it sowhat we'd have to do I suppose and thisis for later on rightI guess what you have to do is break itup into some kinds of shapes that youcan't work out for instance now I've gottwo prisms and I can work out each oneindependently okay so that's how I wouldapproach that kind of question but thoseare the ones you get today
