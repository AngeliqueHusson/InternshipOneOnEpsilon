okay today we're going to take a look atcontinuity at a point this is a prettytypical ap for your response questionthey will give you some type of functionand then ask you to determine whether ornot the functions continues at somegiven point along that function allright now if you remember yourdefinition of continuity at a point allright that's how you're going to want toanswer this question because every timethey always ask you to justify youranswer so over here I refresh our memoryhere with the definition of continuityat a point all right a function f iscontinuous at C if the following threeconditions are met all right f of C isdefined the limit as X approaches C of fof X exists and the third part the limitas X approaches C of f of X equals F ofC all right if so if i'm going to showor determine whether or not thisfunction is continuous at x equals 1 1being my c value all right now i'm goingto justify that my answer i'm going touse all three parts of this definitionall right and then if as long as eachone of these are true or holds then yesit's going to be continuous at C if oneof these three parts in this definitionfails to exist then the function is notcontinuous at that point all right sousually the way I like to set up myresponses are tell my students to settheir responses since it says justifyyour answer you cannot assume that theperson is gray and your paper knows whatyou're thinking or what you're going tobe doing all right so since the questionsays determine whether or not f iscontinuous at x equals 1 all right tellthem what you're going to do literallywrite it out word-for-word all right youmight start with something like for F tobe continuousat x equals 1 then the following threeconditions must be met at that pointthey may probably realize oh hey you'regoing to discuss the three points thatare in that definition continuity at apoint all right however the point isyou're telling them for it to becontinuous the following threeconditions must be met so as soon as youshow that one of those conditions arenot met than it would not be continuousif you're able to show all three partsare continuous or are met then you canshow that it's continuous all right sothen outline it very nicely all rightthe first thing you're going to consideris the first part all right FOC isdefined so in other words for this onesince my C is one I have got to showthat F of 1 must be defined that's thefirst part that I have to show all rightso what I'm going to do is I'm going totake f of 1 i'm going to plug it in overhere and see what i get well at x equals1 the function is to so f of 1 equals 2all right is defined all right so i canjust say f of 1 equals 2 so it isdefined all right that would probably bea good enough part written out thereyou're showing f of 1 equals to f ofone's going to be defined it is to findso we're good the first condition is metokay second part the limit as Xapproaches C of f of X has to exist allright so in other words on this one I'vegot to have the limit as X approaches 1of f of X has to exist all right sothat's what I'm trying to prove on thisone okay so what I'm going to do is I'mgoing to calculate that limit so thelimit as X approaches 1 of f of X equalsnow let's say fing figure out with thelimit is okay so coming from the left xis less than or equal to 1all right the limit would be one allright coming from the right X is greaterthan or equal to 1 i'd be coming fromthe right here if i plug one in twominus one is going to be one so againthe limit is 1 okay so the limit as Xapproaches 1 of f of 1 equals 1 so thelimit exists alright so I've just provedthat the second part of the definitionholds true all right now let's check thethird part of the limit of thedefinition the limit as X approaches 1of f of X must equal F of 1 okay thelimit as X approaches 1 of f X mustequal F of 1 ok so we've alreadycalculated this right here so let'srewrite it and show that the limit as Xapproaches 1 of f of X we said was onewe've already calculated this in part 1so we can say f of 1 is equal to 2alright so I said in this condition thatthose two things must be equal obviouslythey are not equal all right so i candraw a conclusion therefore the limit asx approaches 1 of f of X does not equalF of 1 ok so this one fails this one wasmet this one was mad this one does notfailed so therefore my this function isnot continuous at one all right so let'swrite an overall conclusion all righttherefore and then since we use thedefinition of continuity at a point wecan say they're there for by thedefinition of continuity at a point I'mgoing to do some abbreviating there F isnot continuousat x equals 1 all right so I haveanswered the question I've determinedwhether or not f was continuous at xequals 1 I have justified the answer andI justified it by writing absolutelyeverything out I took that definition ofcontinuity at a point I took all threeparts of that and took them individuallyand draw a conclusion from themindividually so that I could look at itas a whole and then determine by usingthe overall definition if it wascontinuous or not all right nice wellwritten answer for an AP free responsequestion that deals with continuitythanks for watching if you liked thevideo go ahead and give me like and besure to share with your friends thanks
