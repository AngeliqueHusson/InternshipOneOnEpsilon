hi now here I have five terms in asequence and wonder if you could tell mewhat the next term is going to be whenit's going to be 320 and the next termafter that is going to be 640 but why isthat well you should have seen thatwe're multiplying each term by aconstant value and in this example we'remultiplying each term by two all the wayalong it's another example for you inthis example what are we now multiplyingeach term by we're multiplying each termby minus 1/248 times minus 1/2 is going to give meat minus 24 and if I multiply minus 24by minus 1/2 you get 12 and so on so thenext term in the sequence will be 3 andthe one after would be minus 1/2 and soon okay now when we get sequences likethis where we multiply each term by aconstant valuethey're called geometric progressions orgeometric sequences well quite oftenwe're going to find that we're going tohave patterns of numbers like these forexample and we're going to need to knowwhat a particular term is and it's allvery well seeing here that the thirdterm in this sequence is 40 and thefifth term is 160 but suppose you wantedthe hundreth term you don't want towrite all of these out and also we'regoing to want to know what the sum ofall of these terms are going to be againthe sum of the first three terms isclearly 70 10 plus 20 plus 40 butsuppose I wanted the sum of the firsthundred termsI'm not going to want to just type themall into a calculator and add them upfar too long so in this tutorial what Iwant to do is show you how we can getgeneral formulas for the nth term andthe sum of the first n terms in ageometric progression now in generalwhat we've got if we've got a geometricsequence is that the first term is oftenreferred to as a and we multiply thisfirst term by a particular number aconstant value which we'll call our sothe next term the second term would be aR and we multiply this term again bythat constant value R so the third termbecomes a R squared and so on the fourthterm a R cubed fifth term a R to power 4and this will go on like this so this isa geometric sequence we just put theword sequence there for the moment soclearly you should be able to see thatthe nth term is given by a times R tothe power n minus 1 so if I wanted thethird term in would be set at 3 and itwould be a R to the 3 minus 1 a Rsquared and you can see the third termin is a R squared now if it came toadding these terms up we would have whatis called a geometric series so if Iwanted to add them up let's say a plusAR plus AR squared and so onwe're going to use a standard letter forthe summation of the first n terms thatletter is often written as s with asubscript n it's the sum ofthe first n terms so this is going to goall the way up to a R to the power nminus 1 the nth term being a R to the nminus 1 and it can be shown that the sumof the first n terms in a geometricprogression is given by this formula abracket R to the power n minus 1 alldivided by R minus 1 mind you somepeople prefer to use another formularather than this one if we multiply topand bottom by minus 1 you end up with atimes and we can switch the terms inthis top bracket around and get 1 minusR to the power N and we switch the termsaround the bottom because if we multiplythis by minus 1 we get minus R plus 1which we prefer to write as 1 minus Rthey'll both give you exactly the sameanswer so it doesn't matter whichformula you use but we tend to use thisone when our common ratio themultiplying number tends to be more than1 and it's a good idea to use this onewhen R is less than 1 as I say itdoesn't matter which one you use justgenerally now I'd like to just do you aquick example on using these twoformulas we've got a sequence fourtwelve thirty six hundred and eight andso on and we've got to find the sixthterm and the sum of the first 10 termsbut clearly this is a geometricprogression you can see that we'remultiplying each term by three so whenit comes to working out what the sixthterm is then according to our formulafor the nth term it's going to be a R tothe N minus 1 a being the first termwhich in this example is the four sobefore times theand ratio which is three we'remultiplying by three to the power nminus one we're looking for the sixthterm so any six so six take away one isfive if you work this out on yourcalculator you'll find you'll get 972 sothe sixth term in this sequence we'vegot the first four here would be 972 nowadmittedly you could have used yourcalculator and just got that sixth termvery quickly by doing 108 times threeand then times three again I would havegiven you your 972 but this is just aquick example to show you how you canget a particular term in the sequencewhen it comes to finding the sum of thefirst 10 terms then we're looking at s10 s 10 and being 10 is given by one ofthese formulas so I'm going to take thisone here because the common ratio isthree and it's more than one but youcould try the same with this formula andit will still work so for s 10 it willbe a which is the four times the commonratio three to the power n three to thepower 10 in this case take one and thenit's divided by our minus one three takeaway one work that out on yourcalculator and what you should find youget is that it comes to 118 thousand and96 okay well that's just a very briefintroduction to the geometricprogression or geometric sequence and Iwould certainly encourage you to look atthe examples which follow because theytake this a bit further but still we'reusing these formulas ok well that bringsus to the end of this particulartutorialyou
