Hello. I¡¯m Professor Von Schmohawk
and welcome to Why U.In the previous lectures, we explored some
examples of the earliest number systemswhich were used primarily for counting objects.These counting numbers are called
¡°natural numbers¡±.The natural numbers start at one
and can count to arbitrarily large quantities.As we have seen, Roman numerals are one of
many possible ways to represent natural numbers.The Roman system was eventually replaced with
the modern decimal number systemwhich uses ¡°positional notation¡±
and only ten numeric symbols.The decimal number system was found to be
superior to the ancient Roman systembecause of the simple rules it uses
to create numbers.In the decimal system there are ten numeric
symbols, 0 through 9, called ¡°digits¡±.Depending on the column they occupythese digits represent the quantity of onestenshundredsthousandsand so onwhich make up the number.In positional notation,
the column occupied by a digitdetermines the ¡°multiplier¡± for that digit.For example, in the decimal systemthe value of the right-most digit
is multiplied by 1.The digit in the next column to the left
is multiplied by 10.The next digit is multiplied by 100
and so on.The value of a number is the sum of
all its digits times their multipliers.For example, the value of
the decimal number 1879is 1 times 1000plus 8 times 100plus 7 times 10plus 9 times 1.In any positional notation, each column¡¯s
multiplier differs from the adjacent columnby a constant multiple called
the ¡°base¡± of the number system.In the decimal system, each column multiplier
is ten times the previous column.Therefore the decimal system is called a
¡°base-10¡± number system.There are an infinite number of columns in
the decimal number systemwith each column multiplier being ten times
bigger than the column to the right.However, when writing a number,
the zeros in front are normally not written.We can count up to 9using only the ones column.Once we reach 9the ones column starts over at 0and the tens column increments.As we continue countingthe tens column counts the number of timesthat the ones column
has passed from 9 to 0.In other words, the tens column registers
the number of tens which we have counted.This continues until we reach 99.At that point
the ones and tens columns start over at 0and the hundreds column increments.The positional notation system is simple.Every time a column passes from 9 to 0the next column to the left increments.How is it that we ended up with a number system
based on multiples of ten?There is not any good reason
for choosing ten over some other numberother than the fact that people have ten fingersand probably originally communicated quantities
using their fingers.But what if we were cartoon characters
with four digits on each hand?Is it possible that in cartoon landeveryone uses a number system
based on multiples of eight instead of ten?How would a base-8 or ¡°octal¡±
number system work?In octal there are only eight numeric symbols
instead of ten as in decimal.Instead of 0 through 9
the symbols 0 through 7 are used.The symbols 8 and 9 are not needed.Counting in octal is very similar
to counting in decimal.Since there are no symbols for 8 or 9the highest quantity which can be represented
in the ones column is 7.Counting an eighth item
causes the ones column to start over at 0and the next column to increment.So the second column
counts the number of eights.Therefore in octal
the number following 7 is 10which looks just like the decimal number ten.After octal "10" comes octal  "11",  "12",  and so onuntil we get to octal "17".At that point, we go to octal "20".The second column has now counted
two ¡°eights¡± or sixteen.We continue like this until we get to the
highest number we can represent with two digitsoctal "77".At that point, the ones and eights columns
start over at 0 and the third column increments.The 1 in the third column represents
eight ¡°eights¡± or sixty-four.Each column multiplier is
eight times the previous one.Every number which can be written in decimal
can also be written in octalalthough after counting to 7the way the quantities are represented
is completely different.It is easy to convert an octal number to decimalwhen you consider how positional notation works.Let¡¯s take for example, the octal number "1750".As in decimal, the value of the octal number
is the sum of all its digits times their multipliers.So the number "1750" represents1 times 512plus 7 times 64plus 5 times 8plus 0 oneswhich adds up to the quantity
which in decimal is called one-thousand.You may sometimes see a small subscript 8 or 10
after an octal or decimal numberin case there may be some confusion
about which base is being used.Digital computers use electronic circuits
called ¡°flip-flops¡± to represent numbers.Each flip-flop can store a single bit
which can represent either a 0 or a 1.Multiple bits can be combined to represent
a base-2 or ¡°binary¡± number.In the binary number system
0 and 1 are the only two numeric symbols.Since binary is base-2each column multiplier is two times
the multiplier of the previous digit.And just like decimal or octal numbersthe value of a binary number is sum of
all its digits times their multipliers.Since the digits are either 1 or 0
the calculation is simple.We just add the multipliers
of all the columns which contain ones.For example, the binary number 11010represents 1 sixteenplus 1 eightplus 1 twowhich is equal to twenty-six.Even though digital computers
store numbers in binaryit can be quite tedious to write down
or remember large binary numbers.For instance, the number one-million
in binary isone one one onezero one zero oneone zero zero oneone zero one onezero zero zero zero.Early in the history of digital computersengineers found that it was easier
to use octal notationthan to deal with long strings
of ones and zeros.Three binary digits can be represented
by a single octal symbol.It is easy to memorize the eight possible
combinations of three binary bits.To convert a multiple-digit octal number
to binaryeach octal digit in the number
is converted to a 3-bit binary equivalentand the binary digits are all combined
into a single binary number.Any leading zeros can be removed.To convert a binary number to octal
we do the same thing in reverse.To convert this binary number back to octalwe split it into 3-bit groups
starting from the rightand each 3-bit group is then converted
to its equivalent octal symbol.So the octal equivalent to this binary number
is "3654660"a lot easier to remember
than all those ones and zeros.Today, computer storage is normally organized
into 8-bit groups called "bytes".Because of this, many computer engineers
prefer to use base-16otherwise known as ¡°hexadecimal¡± or ¡°hex¡±
instead of octal.With hexadecimal, every group of four bits
converts to a single hex symbol.Two hex symbols represent exactly one byte.Even fewer digits than octal are required
to represent a given numberand it's just as easy to convert
back and forth to binary.Hexadecimal numbers
use sixteen numeric symbols.The symbols 0 through 9
are used just as in decimalbut six more symbols are needed.Instead of making up new symbols,
the letters A through F are usedto represent what we call
ten through fifteen in decimal.Counting in hexadecimal
works the same way as in decimal or octalexcept that hex uses sixteen symbols per digit.Because each column multiplier is
sixteen times larger than the previous columnhexadecimal can represent large numberswith fewer digits than octal or decimal.When counting in hexadecimalafter getting to F which is decimal 15we go to "10" which is decimal 16then  "11",  "12",  and so on.Once we reach 1Fwe go to "20" which is decimal 32.When we get to the largest number which we
can represent with two hex digits, FFwe go to "100" which is decimal 256and so on.As we mentionedusing hex notation, four binary bits
can be represented by a single hex symbol.Each of the sixteen possible combinations
of four bitsis equivalent to a single hex digit.Let's convert the same binary number as before
to hex.Starting from the right,
we group the digits into groups of four.Each group of binary digits is then converted
to its equivalent hex symbol.So we have seen how the same natural numbercan be represented in base-2
using two numeric symbolsbase-8 using eight symbolsbase-10 using ten symbolsand base-16 using sixteen symbols.But no matter how we choose to write
this natural numberit still represents the same quantity.As you have seenwe use the same basic rules for counting in binaryoctaldecimaland hexadecimal.The only difference is that each base has
a different number of numeric symbols.So using positional notationwe can create a number system
using any natural base we like.Try creating one of your own.Who knows, it might catch on!
