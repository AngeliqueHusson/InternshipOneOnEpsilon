okay so welcome to my video on standarddeviation and standard deviation is justa fancy way of saying how far apart orhow close together all of the numbers ina data set are so let's take a look atthis data set in black we have 28 29 3031 32 if we took the average or the meanof this data set and we added all ofthese numbers together and then wedivided by five we would get a averageof 30 and most of you probably could dothat just by looking at it and if wetook a look at the data set in blue onthe right we have 10 20 30 40 50 if wetook the average or the mean of thisdata set and we added all these numberstogether divided by 5 we also have amean of 30 so if we just looked at themean of both of these data sets we wouldthink that they're exactly the samebecause they both have an average of 30but clearly just by looking at them weknow that this isn't true the numbers inthe black are much closer together tothe mean than the numbers in blue inblack the smallest number is 28 and thelargest number is 32 that is very closeto our average of 30 where our data setin blue our smallest number is 10 andour largest number is 50that's much farther away than ouraverage of 30 so since the the data setin blue the numbers are much fartherapart they have a larger standarddeviation than the data sets in black sothat's my brief introduction and let'sjust get started right awaywith an example okay so let's pick someeasy numbers let's say we have thenumbers 1 2 3 4 and 5 so the first thingI like to do before I find the standarddeviation is find the average or themean of the data set so that's what I'mgoing to do right now the average or themean I always write with a X with a barover theand that is equal to all the numbersadded together on plus 2 Plus 3 plus 4plus 5 and then you got a divided by thetotal amount of numbers we have fivefive numbers in the data set so we haveto divide five and that is equal tothree and the next thing I like to doafter I find the average is make a tableand in the left column of the table Ilike to put my values of X and on theright hand side of the table I like toput the value of X minus our average Xbar and then we like to square it so onthe left hand side our values of X arejust going to be all of our values ofthe data points so we have a data point1 2 3 4 5 and in the right-hand side ofthe table in this column we just put Xminus X bar so in the first row we haveX of 1 so our x value is equal to 1minus X bar which is our average so 1minus 3 squared in our second row wehave an x value of 2 so 2 minus X barour average 3 and then we have to squareit in our third row we have an x valueof 3 subtracted by our average of 3 andthen we need to square it in our fourthrow we have an x value of 4we need to subtract it from our average3 then we need to square it and then inour fifth row we have an x value of 5subtracted by X bar which is 3 and thenwe need to square it and if we simplifyall of these rows in our first row wehave 1 minus 3 which is negative 2negative 2 squared is a positive 4 inour second row we have 2 minus 3 whichis negative 1 negative 1 squared is apositive 1 in our third row we have 3minus 3 squared which are 3 minus 3which is 0 0 squared is equal to 0 inour fourth row we have4-3 positive 1 positive 1 squared isalso positive 1 and in our 5th row wehave 5 minus 3 squared which is positive2 2 squared is equal to 4and if we add all of our values in theright hand side of the table we have 4plus 1 which is 5 5 plus 0 is 5 5 plus 1is 6 6 plus 4 is equal to 10 so thesummation of all the values on the righthand side of the table is equal to 10and I'm going to write this usingmathematical notation the summation ofall the values of X minus our average ofX bar and if we square that thesummation is equal to 10 and we're goingto use this value of 10 in our standarddeviation formula which brings me to mynext point what is the standarddeviation formula and that depends ifwe're talking about a sample or apopulation if we're talking about asample now the formula is usuallywritten with an S 4 standard deviationis equal to the square root of thesummation of X minus X bar squared alldivided by n minus 1 and n is just thetotal amount of data points and if we'retalking about a population then theformula for standard deviation iswritten with the Greek letter Sigma andthat it's really similar to the sampleformula it's equal to the square rootthe numerator is exactly the same it isthe summation of X minus X bar squaredand this is all divided by just ninstead of n minus 1 ok so many peopleget confused on which formula that theyneed to use let's take a look at ourdata set let's say these numbers 1 2 3 45 repa sample from a larger population ifit's just a small sample from a largepopulation then we need to use the firstformula so let's plug plug everything into the first formula and our standarddeviation would be the square root ofthe summation which we know is equal to10 divided by n minus 1 our n is equalto 5 minus 1 and if I plug this into acalculator and rounded to 2 decimalpoints I would get a decimal of onepoint five eight so the standarddeviation if it was a sample would beone point five eight so now let's assumethat these five numbers represent anentire population and we need to findthe standard deviation then we'd have touse the second formula which is thesquare root of the summation of X minusx-bar squared which we know is ten alldivided by n which we know is five andif we plug that into a calculator wewould get an approximate answer roundedto two decimal points of one point fourone so if these five numbers representedan entire population then the standarddeviation would be one point four one soI hope this gave you a better idea ofwhat standard deviation really is in mynext video I'm going to talk about thebell curve and how we can use thestandard deviation when we make a bellcurve so I really hope you're enjoyingthese tutorials and I will see you in mynext one
