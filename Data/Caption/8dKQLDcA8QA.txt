in this video I'm going to be taking alook at volumes of known cross-sectionsthis is a pretty common thing that istested on the AP calc a B test it'sgenerally in the free response sectionand it's probably going to be like PartD of one of the free response questionsso in general we're going to find thevolume of a solid whose cross-sectionsare perpendicular to the x axis byintegrating from A to B the area of ourcross section okay we're going tointegrate the area of our cross sectionso looking at a picture like this yequals x squared standard parabola herelet's say I've got a region from A to Bokay this region is going to be the baseof my solid and my solid is going togrow three dimensionally up this isgoing to be the base of the solid I'mgoing to take cross-sectionsall right maybe a cross-section of asquare or a semicircle or a righttriangle and those cross sections willall be the same shape but differentsizes based on the links of the curveand we are going to integrate the areaof those cross-sections now to bettersee that visually 3d hereall right hopefully these pictures showup pretty good I've got this y equals xsquared curve all right in this righthere each one of the cross-sections aresquares and as you can see the sizes ofthe squares change but they areperpendicular to that x-axis and thebase is that region R okay so this isthe base and everything is going up offof it okay if they look like semicircles all right you would just have abunch of cross sections that are also mycircles different sizes all rightdepending on how far the curve is fromthe x axis this shows rectangularcross-sections and this shows righttriangle cross-sections so thecross-section that I choose can be anypretty much any geometric shape that I'mable to calculate the area for okay sothat's what we're in generaldealing with here so for our firstexample all right let's say we've got aregion R the region R is the base of asolid I put this in red because some ofthese keywords are what you really needto focus on it's the base of the solidbounded by the curves y equals x squaredand y equals x plus 2 for the solid eachcross-section perpendicular to the xaxis is an isosceles right triangle sothat's the other major part of this thatyou need to Zone in on here now it'sasking us to find the volume okay so thefirst thing you probably need to do isdo a little sketch ok so I'm going toput the y equals x squared on firsty equals x squared then I'm going to putmy straight line on goes through two sowe'll just rough estimate that slope ofone right there alright so that's my yequals x plus 2 all right so my regionis the section right in here that's thebase of the solid I'm going to begrowing this off from that as my baseI'm growing my three-dimensional shapethis directionall right and they the cross sectionsare going to be isosceles righttriangles now you're not going to beable to draw three dimensionally verywell what this is gonna look like ok sowe're gonna go ahead and put a littlerepresentative rectangle right therealright because that would represent onecross section all right now threedimensionally on this first one let's goahead and look at it ok so here is my yequals x squared there's my straightline okay that representative rectangleright there if I take this and I lay itdown and I tried to draw it laying downthe straight line here is that lineright back there the X to the secondcurve is this curve right here so youcan picture this laying down this is myx axis this is my y axis going back thatway this is my isosceles right trianglethat I am doing as my cross-sectionsokay so note from here to herealright the distance of one of thoselegs is the distance in between the twocurves so even though you're not goingto be able to ten I wouldn't take thetime to try to draw Lane down you've gotto wrap your head around the fact thatwhen you draw it just in two bitdimensions Lane like this you've got toremember or recognize that this is goingto be one of those legs this is anisosceles right triangle so this side isequal to that side okay so you can findthe distance between those two curvesand I by subtracting those two curvesokay so nice little three-dimensionalpicture there all right so you've gotyour sketch all right let's even addthat on here this is gonna be the lengtha leg and that's gonna be the length ofone of my legs okay now first thing Iare going to do if I'm going tointegrate the areaokay I'm gonna integrate the area solet's write that down as this genericlittle formula here I'm gonna do volumeequals I'm gonna integrate from A to Bof the area of my cross-section DXthat's just gonna be my general formulathat I want to follow all right nowlet's start analyzing what this areaformula is gonna look like okay so thearea and isosceles right triangle allright well first of all any triangle isone-half base times height all right butin an isosceles right triangle those twolegs are going to be the exact samething all right so the B and the H aregonna be the exact same thing so I couldsay since it kind of makes sense thatthis would be like a heights right therelet's use H all right so really one-halfbase times height is one-half H squaredokay so that is going to be my formulafor what I'm going to integrate and thisH distance right here is the length ofone of those legs so that's H okayand I'm gonna find this H how can I findthat distance right there well I cansubtract top curve minus bottom curve ifI pick a random number here and I plugit intothe top curb that's going to give me theentire distance if I pick the samenumber and plug it into the bottom curvethat's going to give me that little tinydistance right there so subtractingthose two is what's going to give methat distance so then I could even do alittle bit more here I would be 1/2times whatever my top curve is minus mybottom curve and then quantity squaredright so that's what I've got tointegrate now I also have to find mypoints of intersection all right sothere would be a point of intersectionthere would be a point of intersectionall right I can find those points ofintersections by setting the two curvesequal to each other so let's do thatright here points of intersection I'mgonna Bri be a cause I'm running out ofroom there I go a little bit fartherthere we go all right so I'm going toset equal x squared is equal to X plus 2I'm going to move everything to the leftand solve for X so x squared minus Xminus 2 and that should factor prettyeasily for us so we can do an X and an X- 1 and that'll make the negative on thetwo and the plus there so it looks likeI'm going to have an intersection pointat x equals negative 1 and x equals 2 sonegative 1 & 2 so now I know where I'mintegrating from I know that I've got todo 1/2 top curve - bottom curve squaredbecause this is going to be my areaformula that I'm going to integrate sosetting up this integral here volume isequal to the integral from negative 1 to2 and then 1/2 my top curve minus mybottom curve all right the top curve isX plus 2 and then minus my bottom curveso minus x squared quantity squared allright and then DX okay at this point I'massuming that if you are doing a problemlike this the integration should not bea problem you could do this oncalculator you could do this by hand youmight want to simplify it maybe a littlebit pull that 1/2 outintegrate negative one to two mayberearrange those so it looks like apolynomial curve they're squared DX allright so at this point you might want topause the video and then see if you canintegrate that by hand or integrate thaton a calculator if you get done allright you should end up with a 4.0 5there for a final answer but this isjust one quick example of showing youthings that you have to emphasize allright when you're reading these volumeproblems you're gonna look for thephrases the base of a solid you're goingto look for what shape it is all rightyou're always going to be integratingthe area of that shape so focus on theshape you're not gonna be able to drawthe 3-dimensional picture of it layingdown for this is the base so you'regonna have to visualize the distancebetween the two curves all right isgoing to be the distance you needbecause it doesn't make any differencewhether this is an isosceles righttriangle or whether this is a squarethis is still going to be one side ofthat square if I change it to asemicircle this distance right herewould be the bottom of the semicircleand it would it would be drawn off of itas well so that would be the diameter ofthat semicircle so the distance betweenthe two curves is going to be thedistance that you need in your areaformula so you're going to come up withyour area formula figure out how to dealwith that you'll come up with yourpoints of intersection then you'll beable to set up the integral definitelythanks for watching and if you'reenjoying the busy the videos pleasedon't forget to subscribe to the channelThanks
