okay so welcome to my video onmultiplying negative numbers and beforeI get started on some examples first Iwant to go over all of the differentpossibilities that can happen and thefirst thing I want to talk about is whenyou multiply one negative number and onepositive number let's take a look atthis first example right here if youmultiply a negative number times apositive number you get a negativeanswer okay a negative times a positiveis going to be a negative and anotherexample of one positive one negative iswhen you multiply a positive numbertimes a negative number a positive timesa negative is also going to give you anegative answer so that's something youneed to remember when you multiply onepositive number and one negative numberyou're going to get a negative answer sonow let's talk about what happens whenyou multiply two negative numbers anegative times a negative is going togive you a positive answer you could saythat the negatives cancel each other outand you get a positive answer but justremember that a negative times anegative is going to give you a positiveanswer and obviously this is somethingyou've done before a positive times apositive is going to give you a positiveanswer two positive numbers beingmultiplied is going to give you apositive answer so these are all thedifferent possibilities that you need toknow before you get started on someexamples so having said that let's getstarted right away so let's get startedwith an easy example let's say we havethe numbers positive 3 multiplied bypositive 5 you probably already know howto multiply positive numbers positive 3times positive 5 is equal to positive 15but let's say we have negative 3 timespositive 5 okay we have anegative number being multiplied by apositive number so this is like ourfirst example a negative times apositive and we know that this is goingto give us a negative answer so insteadof positive 15 our answer is going to benegative 15 so let's go over anotherexample let's say we have a positive 3times a negative 5 this is anotherexample where we have one positivenumber and one negative number so wehave a positive times a negative so weknow that our answer is also going to benegative so once again our answer is notgoing to be positive 15 but it's goingto be negative 15 so let's go over onemore example let's say we have anegative 3 times negative 5 so noticehow we have a negative number beingmultiplied by another negative numberthis is like our third example anegative times a negative so we knowthat our answer is going to be positiveok our answer is going to be positive soour answer is going to be a positive 15so I hope this gave you a better idea onhow to multiply negative numbers in mynext video I'm going to talk aboutdividing negative numbers so stay tunedso I hope you're enjoying these videosand I will see you in my next one
