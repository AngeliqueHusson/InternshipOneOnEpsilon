here is the number E but E is more thanjust a number E is everywherelet's see how many mathematical andreal-life instances of E I can describein three minutes roll a four-sided dicefour times the chance of not rolling aone is 0.316 four about 31.6%now roll a 6-sided die six times moresides so more rolls the chance of notrolling the number one is 0.33 4/9 a 12sided dice with 12 rolls gives you aprobability of 0.35 two now use acomputer to simulate a hundred rolls ofa hundred sided dice the chance isgetting closer and closer to one dividedby e take the graph y equals one on xdraw the vertical line x equals onenow draw another vertical line so thatthe enclosed area is exactly 1 thesecond vertical line is at x equals einvest $10,000 at 5% for seven years asyou get interest paid more and morefrequently the amount you end up withgets closer and closer to ten thousandtimes e to the power of five percenttimes seven take the curve y equals x tothe power of 1 over x the maximum valueof y occurs when x is you guess thatthe-- suppose a country's populationstarts at ten million and increases bytwo percent per annum the formula forthe population after ten two years isthis is there again get out a calculatorand notice that e to the power of two isgreater than 2 to the power of e so whatdo you say probably because E is greaterthan 2 but e to the power of 4 isgreater than 4 to the power of D in facttake any positive number except for aitself e to the power of that number isgreater than the number to the power ofE no other number does that take a 100leader being filled with water you pourin oil at 2 liters per minute the binhas a leak and the oil and water mixtureflows out of the bin at the same twoliters per minutethe amount of oil in the bin after 2minutes is given by B again take thegraph y equals e to the power of X thegradient or the slope of the curve atany point is actually equal to theheight of the graph at that point let'stake a close look at where the curvecuts the y-axis the value of e to thepower of x at that point is 1 and sureenough the tangent to the curve or theslope of the curve at that point is 1this was actually in an episode of TheSimpsons so E is everywhere even inAmerican cartoons many people will haveseen this equation using the complexnumber I well that means that E is equalto negative 1 to the power of 1 dividedby I times pi this is not the completestory about en I have a look at theextra information PDF if you want to seemore work out the number of ways you canarrange people in a line now divide bythe number of arrangements with theextra condition that no one is in therealphabetically correct place as you getmore and more people the ratio of thetwo numbers of arrangements approaches eI've only really scratched the surfacebut I hope you've enjoyed seeing how eis everywhereyou
