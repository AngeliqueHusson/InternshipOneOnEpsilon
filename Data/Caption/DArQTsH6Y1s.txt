they have proved the isosceles triangletheorem and now we need to prove it'sconverse considered triangle ABC we havebeen given that these two angles arecongruent this is all that is given tous we're given that measure of angle bis equal to that of angle c that's alland what are we supposed to prove we aresupposed to prove that AC is equal to aB which means the sides opposite themare also equal you cannot take this as arule but generally when we have to provea pair of sides or a pair of anglesequal we look for congruent trianglesand then use correspondence but here wesee just one triangle which is ABC insuch cases we make two triangles we cando a bit of construction to let's thinkof the different possibilities of how wecan form two triangles we can draw aline ad like this to form two trianglesabd and ACD if we prove these twotriangles congruent sides AC and a Bwill be corresponding parts of congruenttriangleswhich in turn will also be equal now wecome to the most crucial part of thevideo what is this line how and why dowe draw it remember this line which weuse to form two triangles should bespecial in some way it should help us toprove the congruence of these twotriangles by special I mean it shouldeither be the median or the anglebisector or perhaps the altitude let'stry out the different possibilities whatif ad was the median then BD would beequal to CD ad is the common side toboth the triangles and we have anger beequal to angle C so it will be double SAand SS a is not enough to prove thecongruence between two triangles so wecannotyoung Eddie to be the median say ad isthe angle bisector of angle a which willmake these two angles equal in this casewe have two angles of triangle abd equalto two corresponding angles of triangleACD and a side ad which is common toboth triangles it will be a case of aAAS which is surely a suitable conditionfor congruence so we have basicallydrawn the angle bisector of angle alet's zoom out and understand the proofon the right-hand side of the boardthe proof is really simple considertriangle abd and triangle ACD if wesuccessfully prove these two trianglescongruent we can say that AC will beequal to a B we know that angle B isequal to angle C this is already givento us angle B ad is equal to angle C adwe got this equation after aconstruction and side ad is equal toside ad as it's the common sight tookboth triangles we clearly have a case ofdouble a s triangle abd is congruent totriangle ACD by double a s congruenceand we finally get a C equal to a B asthey are corresponding sides ofcongruent triangles we can write it as CSC TC corresponding sides of congruenttriangles are congruent if two angles ina triangle are equal then the sidesopposite them will also be equal that'sthe converse of the isosceles triangletheorem
