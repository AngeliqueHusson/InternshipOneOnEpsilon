[Music]hello hello my name is Robert a Dukewith yay math dot-org this is called gaymath in studio I'm in a beautiful spacefilled with hens holding hands and it'svery synonymous with my lifereaching out to you I'm trying to holdyour hand and walk you through thiscrazy landscape called mathematics and Ihope this partnership helps you I hopeyou are learning a lot from these videosthat I'm so happy to create for youtoday we're going to be talking aboutthe remainder and factor theorems it'sit's almost obvious once you get it sothat's my goal okay I'm gonna walk youthrough this process to help you seewhat I see so that it's like oh oh okayoh sometimes when students say like ohyou just do the blah blah blah and Itell them I love when students use theword just it's like they just do XYZ someaning they really get it so let's getyou to a place of just so let's firstbreak this polynomial down alright thisis a quadratic with x squared let'sfactor it we're gonna make a point so ifwe factor this guy this is X and X twonumbers that multiply to negative fiveand add to four multiply to negative addto positive if you multiply it to anegative one needs to be negative onepositive that's for sure and whatmultiplies to negative five and adds topositive fourthat'll be positive five and one okay ifwe were going to solve this quadratic orsolve the polynomial we set Y to 0 andbasically it's where this parabola willhit the x-axis when y is zero it'll hitthe x-axisthese x-intercepts of the solutions xequals one x equals to negative 5 allright so here's the question okay wouldthere be a way for us to use division toprove that this is a solution okay I'llgive you a brief examplesuppose I gave you a number like 144 andI said hey you know based on 144 I'mgonna give you a factor I'm gonna giveyou something that can divide into 144evenly that's what a factor is a numberthat can multiply to make 144 and I gaveyou that factor like 16 and I posed thequestion what's the other factor well ifyou're seeking that other factor whatwould you do how would you get the otherfactor if I said that 16 was a factorhopefully instinctively you're thinkingI'll divide the big guy by the existingfactor and I would get the remainingfactor so I'll do the big guy divided by16 because I said it was a factor itmust divide evenlyit's 144 by 16 it happens to be 9 thisis exactly the same all right this isexactly the same if I had this situationhere this polynomial x squared plus 4xminus 5 and I said X minus 1 is a factorbecause it can multiply to make xsquared plus 4x minus 5 and X plus 5 isa factor because it can multiply to makex squared plus 4x minus 5 the questionis if you were given one factor howwould you get the other factor let'slet's play around with it supposing wedidn't know what the factors were herethey are because in later clips we'renot going to know x squared plus 4xminus 5 and I said hey check it out Ican give you a factor one factor is Xminus 1 cool X minus 1 how would you getthe other factor pretending we didn'tsee this right I like putting I likethis method because we really see themountaintop before we get there gives ushope it lets us know it's really not sobad of a climb but now let's do do dopursue this hypothetical this is onefactor that's fine the other it's nodifferent we're going to divide thefactor into the polynomial I'm going todo that using synthetic division oksynthetic division basically goes likethis we put the solution of this factorin the box that is if we set X minus 1equals 0 the solution just like we havehere plusone on both sides x equals one so thatone goes in the box and then we put thecoefficients the numbers in front of thevariables in order here trying to keepkeep track of if there's any zeros for Xlike if it was x squared minus five wewould have to do one zero negative fivezero placeholders are called that wouldbe in place of the X if there's no Xhere but for the time being we have noskips x squared then we have 4x then wehave minus five so we put thecoefficients down one four and negativefive will this divide evenly is thequestion will X minus one divided evenlyand hopefully you believe that theanswer is yes because I offered that Xminus 1 is a factor so if X minus 1 is afactor just as 16 is a factor of 144 itwould have to divide evenly so we'regonna divide this into there ifsomething divides evenly into a termwhat would the remainder be when youknow something divides evenly hopefullyyou know that the remainder would haveto be zero here comes one drop it willdrop it like it's hotone times one is one put that here adddown four plus one is five multipliedthat's five add down zero this is theremainder of course the remainder iszero when something divides evenly andhere we have the remaining factor rightwhen we divide 16 into 144 that resultis nine the remaining factor when wedivide X minus 1 into x squared plus 4xminus 5 we get the remaining factor herein coefficients this is the remainderthis is the constant this is single Xterm and then maybe another x squared ifwe had more terms it would just ascendit would go up but we only have twoterms so we get X positive five righthereit's kind of cool one more thing to talkabout here is the following what is whatis let's take off our 16 and 154 withthat F of 1 f of 1 means evaluate thefunction when X is 1 when X is 1 thatwould mean this X is 1 and we plug in 1here and here let's see what it isbecause we know how to evaluate f ofanything by simply plugging in you justplug 1 into X as a student would saylet's just plug in 1 to X so we'll putthat here plus 4 use a little color okaylet's take this off actually I need thishere let's keep that alive take thisit's a whole choreography isn't so theones in here here and hereso now we're plugging in 1 for X and weget F of 1 equals 1 squared is 1 plus 4minus 5 equals 5 minus 5 is 0 F of 1equals 0 and that's to be expectedbecause we notice that the functionevaluates to 0 when X is 1 the functionbecomes 0 when X is 1 if you lookclosely that leads us to an amazingconclusion ok we could calculate F of 1by simply plugging in 1 here and here orF of 2 or F of 9 by plugging in 2 or 9here into X or we could calculate f ofanything by using synthetic division andobserving the remainder if wesynthetically divide 1 in we'll get that0 that we look for for F of 1 right herein the remainder that's called syntheticsubstitution that's what this is calledyou can solve for f of anything usingsynthetic division and observing theremainder let's do an example let's doone that's not asolution not one or not negative fivelet's do like something fun like sevenseven can be cool let's solve for f of 7in both ways f of 7 by plugging in X is7 and synthetic substitution observingthe remainder and seeing we get the samething there we go so yeah we can leavethis you use that and I'll help us okfirst the old-school way f of 7 Bam BamBamalright here we go F of 7 equals F of 7equals this is okay oh I got myself introuble here we go let's roll up mysleeves if I had any this is a 49 plus28 minus 5 49 plus 28 see I'm not afraidto make mistakes home boys and girls 49plus 28 that's 60 plus 17 is 77 yeah 77minus 5 is 72 oh I wish there wasanother way to solve for f of 7 oh butthere isit's called synthetic substitution rockand roll so we simply dividesynthetically with the solution in thiscase for X the solution for X the valuefor X is 7 7 goes in the boxit's my 7 in a box 1 4 negative 5 forthe Timberlake fans out there and we go1 multiply 7 and we get 28 7 times 28 isdoing it boom fear not themultiplication this is 6 5 this is uhwhoa what's going on what am i doingwhat am i doing this should work 7synthetic substitution ok let's stickwith it this is 2 times that that's ahundred that's 14 plus 5 is 196okay 196 what am I doing wrongsomething's up seven let's see if I canuncover the mystery forty-nine plustwenty eight synthetic substitution Imiss anything one well to add ad there Ifound it I found it I gotta add down notmultiplyI knew it see something was wrong that'swhat I love about math because there'sno fooling if there's no faking itshould work from multiple angles Ialways like to say there's multiplepaths to the mountaintop it's kind ofcool to go through the challenge ofdiscovering my own mistake and I hope Imodeled that for you it's like what'sgoing on it should result in 72 as faras we know this is clearly not going tobe 172 or screaming 72 when you add downneed to add down not multiply downalright that's synthetic division takethis off off probably cuz I'm excitedokayI had down this is 11 77 72 awesome sothen we get F of 7 equals 72 syntheticsubstitution it's called I hope thatmade sense I hope you see that theremainder of synthetic division is thesolution for F of 7 just like theremainder is zero when you actuallysynthetically divide one of thesolutions because it's a factor it'lldivide evenly if something dividesevenly the remainder will be 0 andtherefore we notice that that remainderis actually the solution for dividinganything as a result I hope that madesense I hope you just me to divide 7 inor any number to get F of 7 or F of 10or anything you want observe theremainder andyou'll be able to solve for that answerthank you guys for watching this is amath org the a map and Studio B wholedance and okay felt the luck
