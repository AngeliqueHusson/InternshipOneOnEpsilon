okay this is going to be example two ofusing the binomial theorem so again hereis the formula for the binomial theorema plus B to the N if you watch the firstone I would say one of two things onthis one either take a look at this oneor watch it my advice would be if youfelt comfortable on the first exampleyou know maybe try to work this one outyourself and see if see if we don't getthe same thing okay the first thingthat's crucial in this one is thebinomial theorem has a plus in themiddle right it's a plus B to the N wellwe don't have a plus in the middle wehave a minus negative so we need torewrite this I'm going to rewrite it as3x plus negative Y raised to the thirdpower so now I do have my my a value so3x when I expand this out my 3x is goingto be playing the role of the a valueand negative Y is going to be playingthe role of the B value again thebinomial theorem might be a littleoverkill I would probably just multiplythis one out the long way I think itwould be easier than using the binomialtheorem but obviously we're just tryingto emphasize the process here more thananything okayso let's expand it out so again maybeI'll write it generically so it's at aplus B to the third power if we expandthat out we're going to get 3 choose 0 ato the third plus 3 choose 1 a squared Bto the first we'll get 3 choose 2 a tothe first B squared and then we'll get 3choose 3 B to the third okay well againall we have to do in this case is isevaluate the coefficients and then startplugging things in I am NOT going toabout evaluate all these binomialcoefficients as in the first video youcan take a look at one of those if youwant to see how to evaluate the binomialcoefficients so it turns out and I'mgoing to also show in another video howto use Pascal's triangle to get thecoefficients easy it turns out that 3 to0 is just 1 3 choose 1 turns out to bethe number 3 3 choose 2 also turns outto be the number 3 and 3 choose 3 alsoturns out to be the number 1 the firstand the last coefficients and factoralways ones okay so that's one littlepart of the patternwell okay again now it's just reallyfilling things in so if I want to expand3x plus negative Y to the third powerI'm just going to plug everything in I'mreplacing 3x I'm replacing my a with 3xand I'm going to replace my B value withnegative Y so maybe I'll give myself alittle room here so it says a cubed sowe had a cubed that's not going to be 3X cubed plus 3 times well we had asquared and B to the first power again ais 3 X B is negative Y and then we'llhave plus 3 times a to the first whichis 3 X B squared will have negative Ysquared then our last term when we plugit in will have B cubed B is negative Yto the third power so now it's just amatter of cleaning things up 3 cubed isgoing to be 27 X cubed is just X cubednotice okay so order of operations wehave to square first so 3 squared is 9times another 3 is going to be 27 wehave an X in there we also have a Y inthere but notice we have a positivetimes a negative so that's going to makethat a negative let's see for our nextterm we would have 3 times 3 which isgoing to give us 9 leave the X hangingout we've got negative y squared whichis going to make it into positive ysquared and then if we simply takenegative Y to the 3rd if we take anegative 1 in cube it that makesnegative and then we just tack on our Yto the 3rd powerand hey now we have expanded everythingout okay so obviously againone other thing to you I said when youexpand it the coefficients on the firstterm in the last term are 1 and that'strue when you just expand this verygeneric a plus B the binomial formulaobviously if the a and the B havecoefficients notice here the X has acoefficient of a3 the B has acoefficient of a negative 1 you knowonce you actually expand it out and thensimplify it certainly those coefficientscan can change okay so don't be confusedabout that remark the only other thingsometimes I see people do mistakenlyhere sometimes they'll try to you knowtake the binomial coefficients and anddistribute it but notice there's no plusor minus in between the terms so youdon't have to distribute the coefficientyou just multiply it by by sup mightjust pick whatever you know term orwhatever factor you want to multiply itto all right so I think I'm going to domy first in another video I'm going todo my first example but I'm going toshow you how you can find the binomialcoefficients by using Pascal's triangleand I think that will again it's onemore thing to know but it's kind of aneat little trick and it certainlyexpands things and and makes thingshappen a lot quicker so all right I hopethese videos make sense if you have anycomments or questions questions feelfree to post them hopefully me orsomeone else can steer you in the rightdirection
