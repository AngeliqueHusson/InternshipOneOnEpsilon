hello again everyone and welcome to thislesson on arc length and sector area butfirst let's just talk about circlesevery circle starts out with a centerpoint and a radius if we have those twobasic things we can loop that radiusaround 360 degrees and form a circle andwe know that the length of the outsideof any circle is called itscircumference where in any circle isequal to 2 pi times the length of thecircles radius we also know that thespace contained within the circle iscalled its area and for any circle areais equal to PI times the radius squaredsince we measure area in square unitsnow with those familiar circleproperties in mind let's go ahead andask the question what if we didn't wantthe whole circumference of a circle whatif you only wanted the length of aportion of it in this case we wanted thelength of an arc ad now if we know thelength of the radius of the circle andwe also know the measure of the anglethat intercepts the arc in this case arcAV we can use what's called the arclength formula to find the length ofthat arc a B now what if I wanted tofind the area of just a portion of thecircle just one sector again if I knowthe measure of the central angle withinthat sector and the length of the radiusI can use the sector area formula tofind this area so let's take a break fora second talk about pizza we can thinkof sector area like how much cheese willbe needed to cover the surface of twoslices of pizza not the entire pieand our claim is like finding the curvelength of the crust on a few slices notthe entire pie and now I kind of wantsome pizza all right so let's go aheadand jump into our first example here wehave circle P shown below and we knowthat the measure of angle K PL is 120degrees the diameter JL equals 24centimeters long and we want to find thelength of our KL now here's why you'regoing to use the arc length formula toanswer this question we want to find thelength of KL so they will not find thatcurved distance on the outside not thearea of the inside so now to use thatformula I need two pieces of info I needthe measure of the central angle thetaand I need the length of the radiusthat's going to be our R value wealready know that angle kpl equals 120degrees so that's our value for theta wealso know that the diameter is 24centimeters long divide that by 2 givesus our radius of 12 centimeters and nowwe are ready to substitute those valuesinto the arc length formula replacetheta with 120 replace R with 12 andthen we can evaluate so 120 times 12equals 1440 and 14 forty divided by 180equals 8 now in terms of pi that arclength is just 8 piwe can evaluate 8pi to approximatelytwenty five point one centimeters thatis the curve length of our KL so for ournext example we have Circle K shownbelowwe know that line KC is a radius whoselength is five centimeters long we alsoknow that angle a KC is 117 degrees andwe want to find the area of the greenshaded region now we're going to beusing sector area formula for thisquestion because we want to find thearea of one sector one portion of theinside of that circle so the informationthat we need is the measure of theta thecentral angle within that sector and wealso need are the length of the radiusof the circle we already were told thatangle a KC has a measure of 117 degreeshowever that's not the angle that wewant but we should notice that angle a Kbe the angle that we do want is itssupplement so to find this angle we do180 minus 117 and we get 63 degrees fortheta and we were already told that lineKC is a radius with a length of 5centimeters so our R value is going tobe 5the last thing we need to do issubstitute replace theta with 63 andreplace R with five and now we canevaluate 63 times five squared is thesame as 63 times 25 which equals 1575then divide that by 360 this isequivalent to 35 PI over 8 orapproximately 4 point 4 centimeterssquared the area of the sector shaded ingreen we're still ordering that pizzaright thank you again everyone forjoining us and please reach out to us ontwitter at mash up matt we are dying tohear from you so please share some loveall right we're done here
