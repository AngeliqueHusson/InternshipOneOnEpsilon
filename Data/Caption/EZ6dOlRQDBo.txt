youconsider any triangle and let's call ittriangle ABC we know what the internalangles are but what are exterior anglesof a triangle it's simple we just extendany one side let us produce side BC topoint D like this since we've justextended BC to D it means that BD isalso a straight line that's it thisangle is an exterior angle angle ACD isin the exterior of the triangle which iswhy it's called the exterior angle weknow that these three angles areinterior but this time we will look atthem with respect to their exteriorangle first let's look at this angleangle ACB we know that it lies in theinterior of the triangle and it isadjacent to this exterior angle so withrespect to this exterior angle angle ACBis the interior adjacent angle whatabout the other two angles angle ABC andangle BAC they too are both in theinterior region of the triangle but theyare not adjacent to the exterior anglethey are called as interior oppositeangles let's try to derive aninteresting relation between theexterior and the interior oppositeangles let's erase thisand form a new triangle let's call itABC and we extend side BC to point D forconvenience let us name the interiorangles one two and three and theexterior one as four we know that thesum of interior angles of the triangleis 180 degrees the sum of interiorangles is angle one plus angle two plusangle three this sum should equal 180degrees and can you guess the sum ofangle 3 and this exterior angle whatwould measure of angle 3 plus themeasure of angle 4 be equal to if younotice the figure carefully you will seethat they form a straight line yes theyform a linear pair the sum would equal180 degrees both these expressions equal180 degrees it means they have to beequal we can say that angle 1 plus angle2 plus angle 3 is equal to angle 3 plusangle 4 subtracting the measure of angle3 from both the sides we can say thatangle 1 plus angle 2 is equal to angle 4if you noticed angle 4 is the exteriorangle and angles 1 and 2 are theinterior opposite angles this provesthat the exterior angle of any triangleis always equal to the sum of itsinterior opposite angles
