okay so welcome to my first video onsadistic s-- in this video or going overthe mean median and mode the threecentral tendencies the foundation ofstatistics and it's really importantthat you understand these core conceptsbecause you're going to use themthroughout the duration of your courseso let's get started right away with anexample and hopefully this will all makemore sense after we're finishedlet's say we have the numbers 10 20 3040 and another 40 and we need to find athree central tendencies of this dataset so the mean median mode so let'sstart out and let's find the mean themean is more commonly known as theaverage so we need to find the averageof these set of numbers and in order tofind the mean you just have to add allthe numbers so let's add all our numberswe add 10 plus 20 plus 30 plus 40 plus40 and then we need to then we need todivide by the total amounts of numberswe have 1 2 3 4 5 numbers in our dataset so we need to divide by the number 5and if we add 10 plus 20 is 30 30 plus30 60 60 plus 40 is 100 hundred plus 40is 140 so in our numerator we have 140and in our denominator we have 5 140divided by 5 is equal to 28 so ouraverage or our mean of this data set isequal to 28 alright so now let's findour median the median can be found firstwhat you need to do is order the numbersfrom smallest to largest and this is ourwe have 10 20 30 40 40 so they'realready from smallest to largestand the median is always the numberthat's right in the middlenotice how this number 30 you draw aline through it how there's two numbersto the left of 30 and there's twonumbers to the right of 30 so 30 is thenumber that's exactly in the middle soour median is equal to 30 and just aquick side note the meeting is a littledifferent if you have a even set ofnumbers let's say we had the numbers 1020 30 40 50 and 60 notice how now thatwe instead of having five numbers now wehave six and if we drew a number or ifwe've trying to find the number that'sright in the middle we have them it's inbetween the 30 and the 40 notice howthere is three numbers to the right ofthe line and there's three numbers tothe left from so whatever this happensyou take the two numbers that are in themiddle 30 and 40 and you average themtogether so 30 plus 40 divided by 2 isequal to 35 all right so for thisparticular data set the median is equalto 35 all right so let's go back to ouroriginal example all right so we foundour mean we found our median now let'sfind our mode our mode is just thenumber that occurs the most and I'llcircle the number that occurs the mostin red notice how every number occursonce except for 40 we have 240 s sobecause 40 occurs the most our mode isequal to 40 so now we have found all ourmeasures of central tendency our mean isequal2:28 our median is equal to 30 and ourmode is equal to 40 so many people askme the question what is the best measureis the mean better than the median isthe medium better the mode which measureof central tendency should be used themean median or mode and I don't have anexact answer to that question youprobably should just use your commonsense this will make a lot more sense ifI just use an example let's say forexample that you're measuring yourweight and every day every morning yougo on a weight scale and you measureyour weight so let's say one day youmeasure yourself anyway a hundred poundsand then the next day you measureyourself and once again anyway 100poundsthe next day you weigh a hundred poundsfourth day you also weigh a hundredpounds and let's say on the fifth daylet's say you weigh let's just make itreally ridiculous let's say you weigh600 pounds on the fifth day all rightnow if we found our mean for the set ofdata it would be 100 plus 100 plus 100plus 100 plus 600 divided by five andour mean would be equal to 200 now themedian of this data set is just a numberthat's right in the middle which is ahundred so our median is equal to 100and our mode is also going to be equalto hundred because the number hundredoccurs the most and I think it's prettycommon sense that the meeting and themode are much more accurate measures ofcentral tendency than the mean okay thatis because this number 600 is obviouslyinaccurate there must have been an errorin the wait scale or there must havebeen some sort of error there's no wayyou can gain 500 pounds in one day andthat really affected our meyou know you're obviously your weight isaround 100 pounds and the mean says thatyour weight is the average is 200 poundsso that's not even close the mean isprobably not a measure of centraltendency that you should use and themedian and the mode are much moreaccurate much more accurate descriptionsof this data setum so use your common sense I hope youenjoyed this video and this give you abetter idea of mean median and mode Iwill be making a video on standarddeviation next so stay tuned and untilmy next one I will see you later
