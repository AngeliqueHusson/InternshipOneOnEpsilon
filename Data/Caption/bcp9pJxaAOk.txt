okay in this video I just want to talkabout the midpoint formula and all themidpoint formula says it says at themidpoint between two points X sub 1comma Y sub 1 and X sub 2 comma Y sub 2it says all you do is add the xcoordinates divided by 2add the Y coordinates and also divide by2I've in my experience I've noticed somepeople sometimes forget you know thesigns a little sometimes subtract andone way to maybe think about it is youknow take a kind of a concrete examplesuppose you took two tests and you madea 50% on the first one and a hundredpercent on the second one and I askedyou I said well if those are your testscores what's your test average mostpeople would say your test average is75% and I normally when I ask them howyou get it they say well the average youadd the things together and you divideby the number of them so you have 150over 2 or simply 75% so you know noticea midpoint is just an average of twothings so if you can remember it in thatcontext maybe it'll help you rememberthat you should be adding thex-coordinates divided by two adding they-coordinates and divide by two so inthis example I'm just gonna simply findthe midpoint between these two pointsI've got the point negative 5 commanegative 6 and then I've got the point 5comma 8 so let me try to you know maybeconnect those with a line if I can sonot the straightest of the lines but aline nonetheless so to me intuitivelythe midpoint should be you knowsomewhere around there so you know basedon my solution at least I can even get aquick little conceptual guess about whatit should be so it simply says again tofind the midpoint piece of cake all wehave to do is add the x-coordinates somaybe we can label them as well so thiswill be X sub 1 this will be the point ysub 1 again these are kind of genericlabels it doesn't matter which one youcall x1 y1 which one you call x2 y2so it says if we add the x-coordinateswe'll get negative five plus fivedivided by two and then it says themidpoint for the y-coordinates we'll getnegative six plus eight and divide thatby two and if we simplify that downnegative five plus five will be zerodivided by two negative six plus eightis two divided by two and that simplyreduces to the point zero comma one andto me that seems reasonable zero one heythat would be a point right on they-axis so it seems correct and notice inthis case as well things are kind ofsymmetric we're at negative five we'reat positive five so were five units tothe right of the y-axis five units tothe left of the y-axis the midpointshould be you know zero units away fromthe y-axis which would correspond to anx coordinate of zero you know so againit's good to know formulas but I thinkif you sketch a little picture on thesetwo if you're taking an exam orsomething like that you can quicklyverify that whether it's at least in theballpark or not so all right I hope thisvideo makes some sense and helped youout if you have any questions about themidpoint or any questions or commentsabout this video as always please feelfree to post them hopefully me orsomebody else can point you in the rightdirection
