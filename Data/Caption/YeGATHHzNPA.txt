we've been looking at power lines andangles that you get when you've got themand you've got a line that crosses themand that was the transversal where's thecorresponding angles and they look likean F there's sometimes the F isbackwards and sometimes the F is upsidedown but it's still an F kind of shapesame deal with these alternate angles ifyou would be on the opposite side thetransversal you get something that lookskinda like I said or a backwards nthat's the kind of change I suppose it'sbeen like a lighting right now the finalkind of relationship that I'm interestedis this one over here okay now we keepcoming back to H right I want to compareHur and qrc I see now look at them withme look at them with me clearly clearlythey're not equal right I mean I couldtry and draw them so damn it equals buton this example this angle up here it'sa it's a blunt looking angle rightwhat's the name for a blunt lookingangle that's of it are it's and obtuseliterally just means whatwhereas this angle down here right isnot what's it all it's quite sharp whichis why we call itI shoot right yeah have you ever noticedwhen like if you're reading like a packof pen or something like that it's likefor acute pain you should Dodd batten itupit means shop shopping okay so thisthing was obtuse this air was acute theyare not equal at all but they must havesome kind of relationship right seehere's what I want to look at we'vealready established that a QR is equalto QR D yes what was the reasonwhat do we call them yepgood they're on opposite sides of thetransversal their alternate so I can sayangle a QR is equal to a QR d becausetheir alternate okay and if I had time Iwould write out that reason okay butlook with me at let me get another colorthese two angles together QR D and Q areseeing on this side and cute on theother side okay now thick think back towhen we first started with get anglesthese two angles are related to eachother they're not vertically oppositethey're next to each other so we give ita slightly different name do youremember what we called them now Jasonyeah I Jason tables they're not justadjacent though they are adjacent alonga straight line okay Q see that they'readjacent along C D so therefore I cansay that these two angles they add up tosomething what do they add up to 180degrees angle Q Rd plus angle Q R seethey add up to a straight angle which is180 degrees okay but look look look a QRn q ID are the same right they're thesame so therefore in this next line yeahinstead of writing Q ID I'm going towrite a because they're the same okay sonow add that to q RC which was the anglethat I was just it should still equal180 degreesall right can you see that is that allrightlet me write down this reason isimportant by the way you should probablyhave this one down the reason why theyhave two hundred ninety degrees isbecause angles on a straight line and onthe straight line is see Dave add to 180degrees okay please have that ringbecause like I said the reason is theimportant thing so they're from fromthere I conclude that I can I can makethat swap that substitution betweenthese two angles cuz they're the same itdoesn't look like it now does itso what I would recommend is you makesure you ride it at it enough of herlike don't write it like this yeah so itlooks like go now okay now don't go toit yet I told you it right her time thisis why right I'm gonna finish this offthese two egg was here right have a lookat that they're both inside this littlebox here right they both inside so thephrase we used to say they're bothinside is this phrase you call itinterior because they're both inside butinside so if you look at the shape thatthey form it looks kind of like thislooks like that's how they're bothinside but they're not the same they'renot equal to each other I bet what arethey they're supplementary correspondingangles they look like an F okay if youturn around become two angles they lookkind of like a you rightright and that those alton angles youturn them around they kind of look likeit
