first example they give us this equationof our function and what we're trying tofigure out is does the graph go up tothe right down to the right up to theleft or down to the left well the firstthing what we're gonna do is we're gonnazero in on this highest degree term ofthe polynomial that's the one with thehighest power the highest exponent hereand then what we're gonna do is we'regonna look at the leading coefficient soyou can see the leading coefficient isnegative and what that tells us is aboutthe right end behavior so that means ifit's negative as X gets larger andlarger x is going to go down towardsnegative infinity okay now because thisis an even degree when we go to the leftit's also going to have the same endbehavior as the right so it's going togo down towards negative infinity sowhen it's even 3 they're gonna both godown or both go up but the leadingcoefficient if it's negative that tellsyou about the right end behaviornegative means it's going down tonegative infinity if this is positivewould tell you it's going up to positiveinfinity now if it's an odd degree theleft brand behavior they're gonna beopposite they're gonna go in oppositedirections now if you forget all of thatwhich sometimes it's easy to do is justdo it little tests just say let's say Xis 10 for example 10 to the fourth poweris 10,000 times negative 3 is negative30,000 so when I go over here to X is 10I'm way down here at negative 30,000this term is growing much faster thanthese two terms so I can effectivelyignore these and just focus on this termbecause it's growing the fastest sothat's how I know it's going down to theright now if I put in a negative 10 anegative to an even power is gonna bepositive so negative 10 to the 4th isstill positive 10,000 times negative 3is negative 30,000 so I know that'sgoing down to the left but what we wantto talk about now is how do we writethis in the limit notation so the limitas X approaches negative infinity f of Xapproaches blank now what this means isas X is going to negative infinity asI'm going to the left what happens to fof X f of X are the Y values and you cansee the Y values are going down tonegative infinity if we do the limit asX approaches positive infinity meaningis we go to the right f of X is going toapproach negative infinity as wellbecause it's going down so this is thenotation now if you notice youl am which is just an abbreviation forlimit and we have as a subscript alittle bit below the line like submarineright below the water X approachesnegative infinity and then at the samelevel as the limit here we've got the fof X which represents the Y values andwe have this arrow telling us whetherit's approaching a positive infinity ornegative infinity okay let's do the nextexample I think you've got the idea hereso in this one we can see that theleading coefficients positive so as wego to the right this is going to go upto positive infinity we have an odddegree so as we go to the left it'sgoing to go the opposite direction likeso but to write the notation and limitnotation we have the limit as Xapproaches negative infinity that meansas we're going to the left the Y valuesf of X approach negative infinitythey're going down to negative infinityand then the limit as X approachespositive infinity meaning as we're goingto the right on the x axis the Y valuesf of X right approach it's going uptowards positive infinity so that's theidea here how to describe the endbehavior using limit notation I hopethat helped you understand it a lotbetter subscribe to the channelcheck out some of my other videos onMario's math tutor YouTube channel and Ilook forward to helping you in thefuture videos I'll talk to you soon
