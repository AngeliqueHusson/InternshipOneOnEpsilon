first one is n minus two times 180 thisequals the sum of the interior angles ina polygon so all the interior anglesadded up I just want to show you quicklywhere that comes from so say for exampleyou have a polygon like this okay youcan divide this into 1 2 3 triangles andwe know the sum of the measures of theangles in a triangle add up to 180this particular polygon I drew has 1 2 34 5 sides 5 minus 2 is 3 and you can seethere's three triangles there so 3 times180 equals 540 so that's where thisformula comes into play is you're gonnahave two less triangles okay then thenumber of sides or angles that you havein the polygon so it's always going tobe 2 less now this formula here n minus2 times 180 divided by n we use thiswhen you're trying to find the measureof one interior angle in a regularpolygonnow regular means that all the anglesare the same and all the sides are thesame length so when you find out thetotal measure of all the interior anglesand you divide that by how many anglesyou have that will give you the measureof just one of those interior angles okthis formula 360 divided by n is to findthe measure of one exterior angle that'ssaying on the outside of the polygonagain if it's a regular polygon meaningthat all the angles are the sameyou take 360 divided by n and then thislast one here is just that the sum ofall the exterior angles in a polygonthey're always going to have to 360 itdoesn't have to be regular they justthey're always going to have to 360 sofor example here if I extend you knowthe sides like so these angles that areformed on the outside of the polygonhere okay those are all going to add upto 360 like a circle okay so let's getinto some examples I'll show you howthese work excuse me so and this polygonhere you can see we have 1 2 3 4 5angles or it could count the sides onetwo three four five sides so we're goingto do n minus two times 180 equals thesum of the angles so we have five minustwotimes 180 which is three times 180 whichis 540 okay so if we want to solve for Xthis missing angle here we're gonna addup all these angles okay plus X equalsthe total 540 so let's do that so that's120 plus 80 is 200 plus 100 is 300 Plusthis right angle here that's 90 that's390 so we have 390 plus x equals 540 soif we subtract 390 what do we get we geta hundred and fifty degrees so that'sthis angle right here now on this onehere excuse me and this angle on thispolygon here we're trying to solve forthe exterior angle so what we're gonnado here is we're going to add up all theangles okay and the exterior angles addup to 360 so in this one we're justgoing to go over here and we're gonnasay alright 90 plus 90 plus 120 that's90 plus 90 plus 120 plus X this anglehere equals 360 so that's 180 plus 120is 300okay so 300 plus x equals 360 and if wesubtract 300 we can see that x equals 60degrees that's this angle right hereokay now the next one find the measureof an interior and an exterior angle ofa decagon and what I meant to write hereis a regular decagon so I'll just putthat in there a regular decagon meaningall the angles and all the sides are thesame so a decagon is like decade rightthere's ten years in a decade there'sgoing to be ten angles in a decagon sothere's a couple different ways to dothis we can either use this formula hereor we could use this formula here I'mgoing to use this one here it's going tobe a little bit easier since it's aregular decagon so I'm just going totake 360 divided by 10 that equals 36degrees so each of the exterior anglesof that decagon will be 36 degrees butone thing that you'll notice is that seewhen you extend the side okay like thisthe interior angle and the exteriorthey're going to be supplementary thismight be a little easier to see here sowhen I extended that side exterior angleand the interior angle see how they forma line a linear pair they're gonna addup to 180 so if this is 120 this is 60if this is 36 right the interior anglewould be 180 minus 36 so that's ahundred and forty four okay so some daysit's use easier to use this formula thanthis formula it's just a little bitsimpler if it's a regular polygon rightokay so then the last one if the sum ofthe interior angles of a polygon add totwo thousand three hundred and fortywhat type of polygon is it okay so thisone it doesn't specify whether it'sregular or not it just says that thatall the interior angles add up to twothousand three hundred forty so we'regoing to go to this formula here the sumof the interior angles so it's helpfulto you know memorize these formulas ifyou haven't already and let's see if wecan substitute what we have so we havetwo thousand three hundred and fortyequals and minus two times 180 okayI'm gonna divide both sides by 180 okaythis comes out to 13 and then if I addtwo to both sides I get 15 equals n sothis is a 15 gone okay so when it startsto get up in those higher numbers youcan just put 15 - gone 15 sides or 15angles - God so I hope you've beenenjoying these videos I hope you learnedsomething sometimes it's just a littleyou know piece that's missing that canmake a big difference in boosting yourgrade and I hope these videos arehelping you to do that so subscribe tothe channel and take a look at some ofmy past videos and I've got some futurevideos coming for you so stay tuned andI'll talk to you soon
