so say for example we have y equalssquare root of x minus 2 so this is thegraph here we want to find the inverseof this graph so the first thing we dobefore we want to we find the inverse islet's just go ahead and state the domainin the range for this graph so thedomain is what the x-values can be rightso in this case the domain is going tobe X is greater than or equal to 2 inthe range which are the Y values okaythe vertical component here is going tobe Y is greater than or equal to 0 nowwhen you find the inverse okay of anequation you switch the X and the yvalues and you solve for the new Y butwhat happens in terms of the domain andthe range is that the domain and therange also interchanged because thedomain is associated with the ax therange is associated with the Y so whenyou switch the X and the y the domainand the range are also switching so thedomain and the range for the newfunction ok the domain is now going tobe instead of the range here thatbecomes the domain X is greater than orequal to 0 and then the range would be Yis greater than or equal to 2 okay solet's go ahead and pay attention to thiswhen we go to find the inverse so we'regoing to switch the X and the y so nowwe have x equals the square root of Yminus 2 I want to solve for this Y righthere so I'm going to square both sidesso I get x squared equals y minus 2 andI'm going to add 2 to the other side sothat's x squared plus 2 equals y and I'mjust going to flip this over so we'veget y equals x squared plus 2 but I'mjust going to put a little comment hereI'm going to state the domain but X hasto be greater than or equal to 0 becauseif i graph this entire graph here thisis a parabola span shifted up 2 so it'sgoing to be up too and it's going to belike this ok so there is our parabolabut notice when you find the inverse ofa graph you're looking at the reflectionof the graph over the line y equals xbut you can see we're only interested inthis piece ok that's being reflectedover so we just want this portion righthere okay and that's the part that whereX is greater than or equal to 0 we don'twant this branch over here so I'm gonnaerase this portion that's not that's notour inverse graph we just want thatpiece right there so that's an importantway to do this finding the inverse youswitch the X and the y solve for the newY but then you have to keep in mind lookat the domain in the range of theoriginalfunction switch those the domain of theinverse function is what the range usedto be of the original function so seehow I interchange those so I hope thishelped you understand how to work withinverse functions better subscribe tothe channel check out more math tutoringvideos on my youtube channel Mario'smath tutoring and I look forward tohelping you in the future videos I'lltalk to you soon
