g'day there's a call across the US withimplementation of the Common Core StateStandards and a call in parts of Canadato with their curriculum reforms to goback to basicsso take mathematics learning for ourkids back to what it should be the mathKnights we know and the mathematics werecognize what we see going on inclassrooms at least with what our kidsbring back home to us seems strange tomany if not bizarre if not absurd theexemplar of absurdity making theinternet rounds is this example showinghow to compute 32 take away 12 theold-fashioned way and how to compute itthe new way what can only look at thispage and say egad I agree 32 take away12 is just 20 after all receivedfamiliar traditional algorithm in thisimage the image is a call to go back tothe traditional ways but we as adultshave to really clear as to what we wantfor our kids what learning really meansthe traditional algorithm certainlyfeels like winning to us because it'sfamiliar so let me talk about thisexample and what's really going on inour classrooms today but let me worksome numbers with a bit we'll meet tothem let's do say 43 takeaway 27 here'show my brain works when I look at 43tech weary 27 I think 3 and 10 and 3 toget the answer 16 actually I see thisarts in my mind I see a pair of rollersare side by side put a forty three inchroller and a 27 inch roller next to eachother we just see that their lengthsdiffer by 3 inches and 10 inches and 3inches by brain naturally chunked thedifference into 3 pieces 3 and 10 and 3the difference is 16 and maybe you cansee how to do this one 200 3 take away125 put two rulers side by side and seethat 35 inches and three inches getsfrom 125 to two or three hundred threetake away 125 must be 75 and 3 that's 78whoa this is clever problem-solving thisis smart clever thinking however I alsotaught this mode of thinking in schoolback in my day if I were asked as ayoungster to compute 43 take a 27 in aworksheet I was expected to write thefollowing this algorithm is veryfamiliar to us at alland it was hard for us to distanceourselves from it to see how bizarrereally is at face value because we're sofamiliar with it again we often createfamiliar equate familiarity withunderstanding is of course we can unpackthe algorithm and make sense of itexplain why we work from right to lefteven though retort to read from left toright and while changing three tothirteen is valid it also changed thefor two or three and why doing thiscarrying is hopeful in the first placebut I see what's going on with rulersI've don't worked unpacking what's goingon with the traditional algorithmanother point is it even important forour children to do the traditionalalgorithm in this day and age if thegoal is to reliably get answers tosubtraction problems then the best andmost appropriate means to achieve thatgoal is to pull out one smartphone wecan't be teaching just for the sake ofgetting answers anymore we must beteaching for thinking and understandingand developing the skills and confidenceto just knock your way through bottomsso back to this image can you make senseof the image now what the new way isdoing of course the author of the scriptchosen absurdly straightforwardsubtraction problem to begin with andrequiring a student to write us suchabsurd ly detailed steps is well justabsurd but can you see the thinking inthe new way nonetheless I'd argue thatit's harder to see the thinking not justthe procedural doing in the old way weadults really do fall into the trap ofequating familiarity with understandingwe're teaching mathematics now withunderstanding and by the way students dostill learn the traditional algorithm isnow pushed much later in the curriculumdiscussed only when firm understandingwhat subtraction is and how can becomputed is fully explored thetraditional algorithm is then seen byone and all as a shortcut can a papermethod codifying all that understandingand moreover is offered only as one ofmany possible options for computingsubtractions after all why on earthwould I do 43 minus 27 via the algorithmwhen the answer is so visually obviousThanks
