from the theory of social networks wecan mathematically model and analyze therelationships between people orcountries or organizations or groupscould this method be used to predict theoutcome of Game of Thrones and determinethe fate of Westeros commonly in thefield of social network analysis oneuses a graph also called a network wherethe vertices or nodes representindividuals and the edges representsomething about the relationships orinteractions between individuals thesenetworks might represent Facebookfriendships or help us understand thespread of disease for now we'll focus onone model of a social network eventencodes whether the relationships arepositive or negative in other words ifthey're friendly or hostile and thenotion of structural balance for examplethis graph shows three people Ned Robertand Rhaegar who are all friendlysymbolized by the green edges but ifRhaegar and Robert get into a fight wecan switch the edge to red to indicatetheir new status as enemies among threeindividuals there's only fouressentially different relationshiptriangles all three relationships aregreen two are green and one is red oneis green and two are red or they'realready theories and social psychologysuggests that some of theseconfigurations like the one with allgreen edges are more stable than othersthey call these stable trianglesstructurally balanced if the trianglehas three green edgesNed Robert and Rhaegar are all friendsthen the triangle is balanced everyoneis content and no one has a reason tochange from friends to enemies but whatif Robert and radar get into a fight sothere's one red and two green edgesthat's an awkward position for Ned he'slikely to either pick a side and becomeenemies with Robert or Rhaegar whichmeans they'll switch to two red edgesor he'll convince them to become friendsagain and they'll switch back to allgreenunfortunately for radar that's not theway the story played out because of thisinstability we say that the trianglewith one red and two green edges is notbalanced what if we have two red edgesand one green now Robert and Rhaegar arefighting and Ned and Rhaegar arefighting he replies to saying the enemyof my enemy is my friend Ned and Robertagree that Rhaegar is bad news you'vegot to go no one is motivation to changetheir relationship and the triangle isbalancefinally the triangle with all red edgeswhere everyone is fighting with everyoneelse is not balanced it's likely twopeople will join forces uniting around acommon enemy so these two triangles withone or three green edges are balancedand these two with zero or two greenedges are not the assumptions behindthis idea of structural balance are ofcourse overly simplistic socialrelationships are complicated but we canstill learn about them by exploring themathematical consequences of this modelwith that in mind let's extend this ideaof structural balance to a biggernetwork like this one each vertexrepresents a person and the edges encodethe nature of their relationship eithergreen friends or red enemies notice thatany two people are either friends orenemies that is every person isconnected to every other person byeither a green or red edge this kind ofgraph where every vertex is connected byan edge to every other vertex is calleda complete graph will focus on completegraphs which correspond to real-worldsituations where everyone knows everyoneelse such as a classroom pick any threepeople in the graph those three verticesand the edges that connect them form atriangle that little triangle is eitherbalanced or not the graph has manydifferent triangles in it one for everygroup of three peopleand each triangle is either balanced ornot if each of these little trianglesall the ones formed by selecting groupsof three are balanced then we say thatthe complete graph is also balanced thisis a pretty strict condition if just onetriangle is unbalanced the entire graphis unbalanced there are other ways wecould have chosen to extend thedefinition of structural balance tobigger network and each definition wouldhave different consequences andapplications but for now we'll stickwith a very local definition of balancedthe network is balanced because all ofits triangles are balanced there aremany different ways to color the edgesof this graph green or red 32,768 to beexactsome of those labelings are balanced andsome are not given a specific coloringan assignment of friends or foes we cansimply look at each of its trianglescheck whether they're balanced andconclude whether or not the entirenetwork is balanced but asmathematicians we like to make biggermore general statements are therecategories or types of labelings thatare always balanced or always unbalancedpause here if you want to think about itthe simplest way to label the graphs sothat it's balanced is to coloreverything green everyone is friendswith everyone else in this case eachtriangle inside the graph is all greenand is obviously balanced another way agrass can be balanced is if it splitsinto two rival factions all thesevertices are friends with each other andall these vertices are friends with eachother but any two vertices in oppositegroups are enemies from a socialperspective the fact that a network isbalanced isn't necessarily a good thingit's closer to a stalemate than a stateof harmony for example things wereunpleasant when the Montagues and theCapulets were perpetually feuding but itwasn't until Romeo and Juliet fell inlove which sent their network out ofbalance that things began to changethey were balanced as two rival groupsand then again at the end with everyoneat peace but not while Romeo and Julietwere crossin group lines in fact in 1953 FrankHarare proved that these are the onlytwo ways a complete graph can bebalanced in other words in a completebalanced graph either everyone isfriends with everyone else or thevertices of the graph split into twogroups where each individual is friendswith each other member of its group andenemies with each member of the othergroup that's it those are all thecomplete balanced graphs let's provethis theoremwe'll start by assuming we have somebalanced complete graph the edges mightall be green but that's the boring caseso let's assume at least one edge is redour goal is to divide the vertices intotwo rival factions to prove the theoremthis might seem tricky since we don'tknow anything specific about the numberof green or red edges or where they arewe only know the graph is balanced butthat's all we need to know we assumedthe graph has at least one red edge solet's start there there are two verticeson either side of this edge we'll focuson this purple one the purple vertex isconnected to every other vertex byeither a green or red edge color all thepurple vertex as friends the ones it'sconnected to by a green edge blue andcolor all the purple vertexes enemiesthe one is connected to by a red edgeyellow these are the two rival groupsthe blue vertices plus the purple oneform a group and the yellow verticesform a group how do we know everyone isfriends with the other members of theirgroup let's look at two yellow verticesthey are both enemies with the purplevertex so they must be friends with eachother to form a balanced triangle twoblue vertices are both friends with thepurple vertex so they must also befriends to form a balanced triangle howdo we know all the blues are enemieswith all the yellows blue is friendswith purple and yellow is enemies withpurple so the only way to form abalanced triangle is if blue and yelloware enemies we started by assuming eachof the triangles in the graph isbalanced which is a local propertyit's about how any three people interactwith each other and we proved a globalproperty that the entire graph mustsplit into two enemy groups knowledge ofsmall-scale interactions told ussomething about the group's big scaleinteractions the vertices of the networkcan represent things besides people likecountries here's an example from WorldWar one each graph represents thechanging relationships between GreatBritain France Russia Italy Germany andaustria-hungary as they shiftedalliances each graph is structurallyunbalanced until finally they split intotwo groups a balanced configuration inthis balanced state no one could easilybe persuaded to change alliances whichled to war in the description we'velinked to a paper describing thisexample as for Westeros so manydifferent factions are fighting witheach other they're nowhere nearstructurally balanced but there may be astable configuration in their nearfuture and just for fun what happens ifwe tweak the definition of structuralbalance let's define a complete graph tohave weak structural balance if none ofthe triangles in the graph have twogreen edges and one red edge in ourprevious definition of structuralbalance we forbid both of thesetriangles but now we only forbid thistriangle under this weaker definition ofstructural balance what colorings of thecomplete graph are balanced just likebefore everyone can be friends or theycan split into two rival groups but thisweaker definition of structural balancealso allows some other possibilitieshere's your challenge problem for theweek what are all the possible coloringsof complete graphs that have weakstructural balance in other words howcan we color a complete graph so thereis no forbidden sub triangle to greenand one red can you prove your guestsleave your answer in the commentshello I don't have many comments torespond to this week because skive allreamed pretty much answered all thequestions which is awesome for me cuz Icould just go to the beach so thanksI found one question I wanted to respondto at a logo app if all voters wereindistinguishable if they're all treatedequally that's a great question and theanswer is no in the case of adictatorship that's where one voter isvery different than the rest but you canalso have voting systems where somepeople's votes count a little more thanothers good question so I want to get toour challenge winners Canter's Kat andDavid to close our collective challengewinners they proved that a polarizingcandidate is either first or last in theoverall rankings using a voting systemwith unanimity and independence ofirrelevant alternatives and they'reproof it's in a collective thread wherethey're collaborating answering eachother's questions and I lovecollaboration so go read the thread andcheck it out thanks guys
