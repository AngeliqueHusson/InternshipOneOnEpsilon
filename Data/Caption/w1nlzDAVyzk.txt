g'day welcome to tech mouth Channel whatwe're going to be having a look at inthis video is how to work out the amountof combinations possible when we selectthe number of objects from a largergroup this is part of a series of videoswe'll be looking at combinations andpermutations so the first thing I knowaddresses how combinations differ frompermutations which is this withcombinations order doesn't matter it'syou an example of this so sales had fivebooks five different books and I'llwrite that down and I was going toselect three of them now I was going toselect these three books and I'm goingto take them on holiday I'll show youthe books they are greeny sort of colorbook I've got a dark green sort of bookI got a black book I've got a blue bookand I have a red book and from thesefive books I'm going to select three ofthem to take away but it doesn't matterwhat order I grabbed my was going tochuck them in a suitcase withcombinations order doesn't matter so howdo I go about working how many differentways I could do this well the firstthing I do is I'll show you the spacesfor three books one two three and whatyou might realize is when I select myfirst book I've got five different thisis the first one to go here I've gotfive books to choose from one two threefour five so I'm going to put thatnumber in there so I select the firstbook say it's the red one there and itleaves me with now four books to choosefrom for this second space like checkmaybe this book and then it leaves mewith three different books for the thirdspace so all I need to do now to workout the number of different ways that Ican get these books are different thisis going to be for permutations and I'llshow you how to extend this forcombinations is we just multiply thesethree five times four times three whichis equal to sixty there's 60 differentways this can be done what this isshowing us at the moment it's sayingthat pretty much that red and if I had achosen a blue and this green here thatit would be considered different togreen blue and red but you know so thisis just the same books with swappedaround in order so permutations wouldinclude this sort of thing andcombinations would say well hang on nowthese are the same they're just in adifferent order so this is permutationstheir answer here we've got 60 so wejust need to do one extra stepin order to work out how manycombinations of things we can choose andthat's fairly logical when you thinkabout it because if we're looking atthree spaces here you might say well howmany different ways can these be orderedhow many different ways can three spacesbe ordered and it's said you mightremember from a few other videos we havethree spaces here to choose from twohere and one this had this manydifferent ways that three differentobjects can be ordered okay the threedifferent spaces so this is set writtenquite often as 3 factorial 3 times 2times 1 which is 6 different ways and wedefy this through and this will tell usthe number of combinations as opposed tothe number of permutations 60 divided by6 equals 10 I'm going to show you thisnow using the rule that they actuallywrite down pretend the truth actuallydon't use the rule very much they arecombinations rule but it's a handy oneto wear to work through just in order toget a bit of understanding but that'sthe way we work out combinations sofirst off this is the rule and I want tosort of show it as we go with with ourexample so say we were looking atcombinations and from 5 things we weregoing to select through them the waythey write this is as follows they writecombinations and from n objects we'reselecting our different wire things okand this equals this one equals wellwhat we did is we selected three thingsokay but I'm going to write this down alittle bit weirdly this is 5 times 4times 3 times 2 times 1 because I'mdealing with the numbers we have here tohelp us work out a rule but what weactually were only left with was thefirst 3 here okay going to notice wedidn't tie the end to in fact what wedidn't take was this 2 times 1 part thispart okay I'll just put a little linesfrom just to show that we didn't takethem and on a rule this could be writtenas n factorial a factorial the numbertimes the Oh 5 factorial is 5 times 4times 3 times 2 times 1 3 factorial be 3times 2 times 1 this is n factorial/ and this is n take away our factorialso n take away our is 2 factorial okaybut then we just have one little extrathing we then divided by and you'llremember that we had the number ofspaces this number here they are ok thiswas 3 times 2 times 1 which is ourfactorial okay that was what we divideit by so you might then look at this andsay ok this was 5 factorial divided by 2factorial and take away our factorialdivided by 3 factorial okay also dividedby 3 factorial and that's a rule we usebut I don't particularly use it Olivialike that I tend to draw it out like Idid when I R was working it out beforeso we'll go through a couple of otherexamples for instance we had a committeeof four people okay we had four peoplethat we were going to select from abigger committee of them so four peopleselected from 10 and how many differentways could we do this and this is wherewe don't particularly care about orderso this is going to be how manydifferent combinations that are possibleso you might just get used to this youmight write their combinations and youmight say 10 and 4 from 10 peoplethey're going to select 4 positions inthis equals and so we're going to havethose 4 positions as 1 2 3 4 positionsok so the first one is tend to choosefrom 10 people and then that thatpositions taken so we only have ninepeople to choose from there now with atrue position sake and so I only leavesus with 8 people to put in our positionand then there's three people here sothis only leaves 7 people and then we'regoing to end up multiplying these okthis is at n factorial over n take awayour factorial part of it but then we'regoing to divide this by you remember thenumber of different spaces herefactorial I so over 4 times 3 times 2times 1and I'm just going to now fill that inand we're going to get what our answeris you can do this using a rule if youwant but I just do it this wayso how can counts left because 8 is thesame as 4 times 2 and then I can alsosay okay well this is 3 and I'm going tobuy this by 3 and get 3 so 10 times 3 is30 times 7 is 210 over 1 so answer isthis 210 different ways of doing thiswhat about one last one of these now thequestion I have for this one is how manydifferent ways can we select from 8people so from 8 people we're going toselect 5 kids to play basketballokay so how many different ways can wedo this so you might give this a go allright now how would I do this first offI'm going to have five different spaces1 2 3 4 5 and this is going to be filledfrom these a people this 8 by 7 by 6 by5 by 4 okay and okay that's the samesort of explanation we're using there wehad 5 different spots so this is goingto be over 5 times 4 times 3 times 2times 1 and we can now start cancelingout we have a 5 here and a 5 here I canput little multiplications here actuallyall right we have a 4 here and a 4 here2 times 3 is the same as 6 this leavesus with a 1 down the bottom which is notgoing to really mean that much and so 7times 8 equals 56 and that's the way youwork out combinations it's pretty cruisyright it's pretty easyum anyway hopefully you get this idea infact if I was going to write this justbefore I go you're going to write thisfactorial and using the rule I'll justquickly do that for youwhat about like jot that down what wouldyou call that do you think we call this8 factorial over N minus R which is umyou know that here 8 take away 5 whichis 3 factorial over 5 factorial allright it's pretty simple right anywayhopefully that video is of great help toyou and I'll see you next time okay bye
