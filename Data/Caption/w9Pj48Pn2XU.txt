we have seen that rational numberscomprised of terminating decimals andnon terminating recurring decimals inthis video we will see how we canconvert a decimal number to the rationalform P by Q when we are given P by Q wecan divide P by Q to get a decimalnumber but to convert a decimal numberinto the form P by Q is a little moreinteresting let's look at thisconversion first terminating decimal tothe form P by Q so let's look at ourfirst example 0.45there is only one thing you need toobserve here it's the digits after thedecimal point in this case we have fourand five two digits after the decimalpoint this was the most important steponce we find this we write the numberwithout the decimal in this case it'szero four five we write it without thedecimal point and divided by some powerof 10 and what will be the power of this10 in the denominator yes it will be thenumber of digits after the decimal pointwhich is 2 in this case this is actually45 so 0.45 can be written as 45 dividedby 10 squared which can be written as 45by hundred there's our answer it's inthe P by Q form this answer is notincorrect but it's not complete we haveto reduce it to its simplest form 5 x 9equals 45 and 5 x 20 equals 100 thisequals 9 by 20 this is the answer sinceit's in the simplest form 0.45 waswritten as 9 by 20 all we had to observewas the number of digits after thedecimal point here's another example 2point 2 2 5 it has three digits afterthe decimal point so first we write thenumber without the decimal it will be 22 2 5 and divided by 10 raised to 3 wewrite 3 as the power of 10 sowe have three digits after the decimalpoint and that will equal to two to fiveby 1,000 and this can be reduced to 89by 40 so we wrote two point two two fiveas 89 by 40 that was simple but what ifyou're asked to write to point two twofive as a mixed fraction a mixedfraction is something like 3 1 by 4 itmeans three and a quarter three iscalled the whole part and one by four iscalled the fractional part so how do weget this decimal form in this mixedfraction form it's very simple the wholepart is the number to the left of thedecimal point two becomes the whole partthe numerator of the fractional part isthe number to the right of the decimalpoint it's 225 and guess whatthe denominator of the fractional partis the same as the denominator in theprevious case 10 raised to 3 again thepower of 10 is equal to the number ofdigits after the decimal point that's itnow we just have to simplify thefractional part to its simplest formthis can be written as 2 225 by 1,000this is the whole part and this is thefractional part this when reduced givesus 9 by 40 so 2 point 2 2 5 can bewritten as 2 9 by 40 that becomes amixed fraction form just to check youranswer it's always recommended that youconvert this into a normal fraction andverify this would equal 2 multiplied by40 plus 9 by 40 that would equal 80 plus9 by 40 which equals 89 by 40 same asthe answer we got earlier whileconverting it into a mixed fraction justremember that the number to the left ofthe decimal will be the whole part andthe number to the right of the decimalwill be the numerator of the fractionalpart the denominator in both the casesis the same 10 raised to the number ofdigits after the decimal placeyou
