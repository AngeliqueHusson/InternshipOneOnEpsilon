in class seven of a school there are twodivisions a and B the average weight ofstudents in class 7a is 50 kilograms andthat of students in class 7b is 60kilograms each division has 30 studentsand remember there are only twodivisions in class 7 with this dataprovided we have been asked to find theaverage weight of Class 7 yes what willbe the average when the students fromboth these divisions are combined theconcept of average is still the same itwill be the total weight of all studentsin class 7 divided by the total numberof students in class 7 total weightdivided by the number of samples nowwhat will be the total weight of all thestudents in class 7 will it be 50kilograms + 60 kilograms of course notwe are talking about the sum of weightsof all students in class 7 so the totalweight of students in class 7 will equalthe total weight of students in class 7a plus the total weight of students inclass 7 B this will give us the totalweight and what about the total numberof students in class 7 it will equal thenumber of students in class 7 a plus thenumber of students in class 7 B now thisis the important part what is the totalweight of students in class 7 a it willbe the average weight multiplied by thenumber of students remember a is equalto s over N hence S will equal a times nso that will equal 50 times 30 andlikewise the total weight of students in7b will equal 60 times 30 and the numberof students in each of the divisions is30 this will give us the average weightof all the students in class 7 solvingthis will give us the combined averageas 55 kilograms this is the averageweight of all the students in class 7notice that it is exactly between 50 and60 so we didn't really need to do allthis right we could have easily foundthe combined averageby finding the average of the twoaverages 50 plus 60 over two would havealso given us 55 kilograms as thecombined average but will this alwayswork let's take another example thistime of grade 8 in a school twodivisionsaverage weights are 50 and 60 and thenumber of students are 20 and 40 thereare only these two divisions in class 8what will be the average of all thestudents in class 8 will it be 50 plus60 over 2 again this is not correct and55 kilos would be an incorrect answerlet's understand how we go with thecorrect definition of average totalweight of all students in class 8divided by the total number of studentsin class 8 that would be this 50 times20 plus 60 times 40 divided by 20 plus40 this is the sum of weights ofstudents in 8a this is the sum ofweights of students in 8b and this isthe total number of students solvingthis will give us the average as 56.66 6kilograms that's the average weight ofall the students of class 8 but wait howcome the average of averages did notwork here to understand this let's takethe two averages at the two ends of aline segment these are the two averagesin question and let this be the centerpoint 55 now observe that there are 40students in class 8b and just 20 inclass 8 a clearly this average has moreweight edge more number of studentsimplies that this average will have moreweight edge and that is why you see thatthe answer is closer to 60 kilograms andnot 50 kilograms it will be somewherehere it's getting pulled toward 60 asthe number of students is more in 8b nowwe go back to the class 7 problem whydid this formula work here it's becauseboth divisions had the same number ofstudents same weight ageonly if the wait edge is the same can weuse this formula else we go with thisone here's another scenario in thisexample what would be the average ofclass 8 if class 8a had just fivestudents and Class A B had 55 studentsthe average weights of 8a and 8b are thesame just the number of students thathave changed what would be the averageof class 8 then pause the video and tryto find the average this time it willequal this 50 times 5 plus 60 times 55divided by 5 plus 55 solving this willgive us the average as 59 point one sixsix six kilograms and clearly this iseven more closer to 60 and why is thatclearly because 8b has more weightedit's 55 versus 5 this is the concept ofweighted average the combined or theweighted average depends on the weightsof the individual averages and don'tworry there are better and faster waysof finding the weighted averages we willcover many more examples over the nextfew lessonsyou
