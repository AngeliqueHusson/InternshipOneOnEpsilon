consider line segment a-b we are giventhat line L is the perpendicularbisector of segment a B this will be aright angle and these two sides will beequal how do we prove the perpendicularbisector theorem it says that everypoint on the perpendicular bisector isequidistant from the endpoints a and Blet's zoom out and write down what'sbeen given to us we are given that lineL is perpendicular to segment a B itmeans that Point C will be the midpointof a B and P can be any point on line Land we have to prove that ap is equal toBP how do we prove this the proof issimple but has two cases which manystudents forget to consider let's lookat case one point P lies on segment a Bwe know that point P lies on line L asthis is given to us it means this ispoint P that is points B and C coincidewe write up P here we also know that Cis equidistant from points a and B sinceline L is the perpendicular bisector itmeans a C will be equal to BC andbecause points P and C are the same wecan write this as ap is equal to BPwhich proved the result for the firstcase let's zoom out and look at thesecond case case two is kind of obviouspoints P and C do not coincide so let'smark point P somewhere on line L but noton point C say we mark it here we haveto prove this distance equal to thisdistance remember whenever you have toprove two sides or two angles equal youshould look at proving two trianglescongruent here we can already see to trytriangle APC and triangle B PC if weprove these two triangles congruent thenwe can say that ap is equal to BP asthey would be corresponding sides ofcongruent trianglesbut are they congruent let's see we knowthat AC is equal to BC as C is themidpoint of segment a-b angle AC P isequal to angle b CP as both equal 90degrees and pc is a common side to boththe triangles so we can say that PC isequal to PC because it is the commonside we clearly have a case of sideangle side it means triangle ABC iscongruent to triangle B PC by the SAScongruence condition that's it we'redone a P will be equal to B P as theircorresponding sides of congruenttriangles we just proved that everypoint on the perpendicular bisector of agiven segment is equidistant from theendpoints of that segmentyouyou
