so we draw the x-axis and name it X - Xwe draw the y-axis and name it y - y howdo we number the axes until now we haveonly seen cases where we have numberedthis side of the x-axis and the side ofthe y-axisone two three four and so on on thex-axis and one two three four and so onon the y-axis the reference point or theorigin is zero on the left-hand side ofthe horizontal axis just like the numberline we mark negative natural numbers -1 - 2 - 3 - 4 and so on similarly onthis side of the y-axis we mark - 1 - 2- 3 - 4 and so onremember all these are marked in equalintervals now let's take a random pointsomewhere on the plane and try to giveit an identity say we have a point Phere it is 3 units away from the originon the horizontal axis and 2 units awayon the vertical axis how do we denotethe point then we write it as 3 comma 2inside round brackets that's theidentity of point P but in mathematicswe do not refer to it as an identity wecall these the coordinates of point P 3is the x-coordinate and 2 is they-coordinate here's something you reallyneed to know this is not the same as 2comma 3 2 comma 3 will be this pointhere 2 units away on the x axis and 3units away on the y axis the ordermatters hence they are called an orderedpair the value on the x axis is alwayswritten first and then we write thecorresponding value on the y axisthis entire system is called theCartesian coordinate system we will soonlearn more about it
