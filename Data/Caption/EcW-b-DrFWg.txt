okay so welcome to my video on dividingnegative numbers and in my previousvideo I talked about multiplyingnegative numbers and the good news isthat dividing is exactly the same asmultiplying this is because when youhave one negative and one positive youare going to get a negative answer let'stake a look at this first example righthere we have a positive number beingdivided with a negative number apositive and a negative is going to giveyou a negative answer and the same forthe second example we have one negativeand one positive we have a negativenumber on top being divided with apositive number on the bottom a negativeand a positive is going to give you anegative answer and also just likemultiplying two negatives and dividingis going to give you a positive answer anegative and a negative give you apositive so this is something toremember before you get started withsome examples so having said that let'sget started right away let's get startedwith an easy example with two positivenumbers which you probably already knowhow to do let's say we have 10 dividedby 5 10 over 5 or 5 goes into 10 twotimes so 10 divided by 5 is equal to 2but let's say we have a negative 10being divided with a positive 5 now wehave one negative number and onepositive number so this is exactly likeour second example we have a negativeand one positive a negative on top and apositive on the bottom and this is goingto give us a negative answer so insteadof positive two our answer is going tobe negative two let's say we had apositive 10 and a negative fiveonce again we have a positive number andone negative number so this is exactlylike the example on the top we have apositive on the top and negative on thebottom a positive and a negative isgoing to give us a negative answerso our answer once again is going to benegative two all rightand sometimes the negative sign is noton the top of the bottom sometimes thenegative sign is right in the middle solet's say we had and negative 10 over 5the negative sign is right in the middleand this causes some confusion for somestudents but you can just look at thisthe same way as the first or theprevious two examples that I did thisanswer is also going to be negative 2 ifit makes you feel better you could takethis negative sign and you could placeit in front of the 10 or you could placeit in front of the 5 so then you haveone positive number and one negativenumber but this is exactly the same asthe previous two examples I did and ouranswer is going to be negative two solet's go over one more example and thistime I'll use a little bit differentformat now let's say we have negative 10being divided by negative 5 and thistime we have two negatives we have anegative being divided by anothernegative okay and just like multiplyingtwo negatives are going to give us apositive answer the negatives canceleach other out and they give us apositive answer so negative 10 dividedby negative 5 is going to be a positive2 okay so I hope this gave you a littlebit better idea on how to dividenegative numbers in my next video I'mgoing to go over some more difficultexamples when we have more than twonumbers say if we had to multiply 3 ordivide three numbers I'm so stay tunedfor that video and I really hope thatyou are enjoying these and I will seeyou in my
