hi there welcome to math antics in thisvideo we're gonna learn how to comparefractions hmmthis fraction has 25% more fiber thanthis fraction oohbut this fraction has trisodiumphosphate well it's not quite like thatcomparing fractions just means tellingwhich one is bigger you know just likewe do with regular numbers when we usethe greater than less than and equal tosigns that sounds easy rightbut unfortunately unlike regular numbersit's not always easy to tell whichfraction is bigger just by looking atthem that's because the value of afraction depends on both the top andbottom numbers and how they relate toeach other for example if you have tocompare these two fractions 1 over 3 and1 over 10some of you might be tempted to say that1 over 10 is bigger because you knowthat 10 is bigger than 3 right but weneed to remember that the fraction isreally a number written like a divisionproblem and its value depends on thatdivision so in this case the 1 over 3 isreally the bigger fraction because it'sdecimal value what you get when youdivide is 0.33 3 3 3but the value of 1 over 10 is only 0.1okay so comparing fractions isn't quiteas easy as comparing regular numbers butthat doesn't mean it's going to be thathard we're going to learn two methodsfor comparing fractions that make itvery easy the first method is calledcross multiplying and it takes advantageof the fact that it's easy to comparefractions with the same bottom numbersif two fractions have the same bottomnumbers then we can just compare the TOCnumbers that's because we're comparingthe same sized parts we're comparingfourths to fourths eighths two eighthstenths two tenths and so on and the topnumber just tells us how many of thoseparts we have so it's easy to see thatfive eighths is more than three eighthsbut many times you'll have to comparefractions that have different bottomnumbers or different size partsfortunately there's a trick we can do tomake the comparison easy in the mathantics videos about common denominatorswe learn a simple method for changingunlike fractions with different bottomnumbers into like fractions with thesame bottom number basically it showshow you can multiply two unlikefractions by whole fractions made fromthe different bottom numbers so you endup with the same bottom number this willgive you 2 new equivalent fractions thatyou can easily add subtract or comparebut there's a shortcut for comparingfractions as long as we know that thebottom numbers of our fractions are thesame we don't really need to know whatthat number is we just need to know whatthe top numbers will be since those arethe ones that will actually compare soinstead of multiplying each fraction bya whole fraction we can just multiplythe top number of each fraction by thebottom number of the other fraction thisis called cross multiplying because ifyou draw a diagram of what you'remultiplying it forms a crisscrosspattern after you cross multiply you'llhave two numbers that would be the newtop numbers if you had made likefractions and those numbers will showyou which fraction is greater let's trythis cross multiplying method on anexample or two let's compare thefractions seven over eight and four overfive we start by multiplying the secondfractions bottom number five by thefirst fractions top number seven andthat gives us 35 for the new top numberon this side you'll always keep theanswer on the side of the top numberthat you multiply it now for the otherside the bottom number eight times thetop number four gives us 32 for its newtop number AHA now it's easy to see thatthe fraction seven over eight is greaterthan the fraction 4 over 5 because it'snew top number 35 is greater than theother new top number 32 let's do onemore comparison by cross multiplyinglet's compare 6 over 11 to 9 over 15first we'll multiply 15 by 6 to get thenew top number of the first side whichis 90 now you can always use acalculator to do the multiplications ifyou need to next we multiply 11 by 9 toget the second new top number which is99 so that tells us that the secondfraction 9 over 15 is greater than thefirst fraction because it's new topnumber 99 is bigger pretty simple huhokay crossthe plans pretty cool but there'sanother way to compare fractions thatyou need to know about but this one'sonly really good if you can use acalculator remember the reason thatfractions are tricky to compare isbecause there are really divisionproblems but if we want to we can justdo the division and get the answer whichis the decimal value of the fraction soif you have two fractions to compare youcan just do the division preferablyusing a calculator and then compare thedecimal values for example let's say Ioffered to give you either five twelfthsof a pizza or seven fifteenth's of apizza now you happen to be really hungryso you want to choose the biggest amountbut it's not very easy to tell just bylooking which is bigger five twelfths orseven fifteenth's this is where decimalvalues can really help you out if youconvert the fractions to decimals bydoing division it will make it mucheasier to see which one's bigger 5divided by 12 is about 0.42 and 7divided by 15 is about 0.47 yep thatmakes comparing them much easier since0.47 is greater than 0.42 it means thatseven fifteenth's is greater than fivetwelfths and that means that you'drather have seven fifteenth's of thepizza sometimes when you comparefractions this way you'll find twofractions that look different but havethe same decimal value like 3 over 8 and15 over 40 if you convert each fractionto a decimal you'll see that they bothhave the value 0.375 to fractions thathave different top and bottom numbersbut the same value are called equivalentfractions if two fractions areequivalent then you can just use theequal sign to show the comparisonbetween them like this alright so thoseare two great methods you can use tocompare fractions cross multiplying issimple and works great even if you don'thave a calculator and comparing thedecimal values by dividing is easy ifyou do have a calculator as alwayspractice makes perfect so spend sometime doing the exercises for thissection and I'll see you next
