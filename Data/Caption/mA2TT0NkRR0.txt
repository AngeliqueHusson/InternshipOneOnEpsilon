to find the centroid of a triangle weneed to first start with the trianglefold your patty paper in three times toform the three sides of the triangletrace the sides of your trianglethe centroid is the point ofintersection of at least two of yourmedians the median is the line from theopposite vertex of a side to itsmidpoint in order to find the midpointof a side we'll use the idea of aperpendicular bisector selecting thisside firstto find the perpendicular bisector Iwill fold the pattie paper so that theline folds on to itself and the verticesare overlapping the line is folded on toitself and the vertices are overlappinghere I'm not going to mark theperpendicular bisector but theintersection of my perpendicularbisector with my side is the midpointindicate that it's a midpoint using tickmarks the median is a line connectedfrom the midpoint to the opposite vertexselect a second side of your trianglefind your perpendicular bisector byfolding the patty paper so that the linefolds onto itself and the vertices areoverlapping the line is folded ontoitself and the vertices are overlappingforming my perpendicular bisector heremy perpendicular bisector intersects myside at its midpoint indicate that it'sa midpoint using tick marks draw yourmedian which is the line from theopposite vertex to the midpoint thepoint of intersection of those twomedians is your centroid
