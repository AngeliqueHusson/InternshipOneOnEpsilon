squared minus 2x plus one being dividedby X plus three okay so we're going toset this up we've got X plus three isgoing into x squared minus 2x plus oneokay what you want to do is you want tosee like how many times does X go into xsquared okay or you can think aboutworking backwards you could say whattimes X is x squared you want to try tomatch this first term because when yousubtract you want to eliminate thisfirst term so that's going to be X andthen we're going to do is you're goingto distribute x times X is x squared xtimes 3 is 3x and then what you want todo is you want to subtract now what alot of teachers will teach and a lot ofstudents will do is they'll change thesigns to the opposite and then they'readd because subtraction is just likeadding the opposite so you can see thatthese cancel and we get negative 5x plus1 okay so now we have to say okay whattimes X is negative 5x or you could sayhow many times is X going to negative 5xor what's negative 5x divided by X wellthat's going to be negative 5 and we'regoing to distribute the negative 5 toboth these terms so that gives usnegative 5x minus 15 I'm going to changethe science to the opposite and I'mgoing to add so that comes out to 16 nowsee how 16 is the zeroth degree this isjust a constant this is the first degreeX to the first this is a lower degreethan this so this is a remainder so ourfinal answer is going to be X minus 5plus our remainder over our divisor soyou take your remainder over what you'redividing by so this is your final answernow you can see X plus 3 didn't go inevenly because we did have a remainderbut you just take that remainder and putit over the divisor like I was showingyou in the long division problems thatwe did a long time ago ok so now let'stake a look at another example 2x minus1 is dividing into this long polynomialsame process we're gonna see how manytimes does 2x go into 4x cubed andthat's going to be- x squared ok notice I'm lining up theX Squared's just to keep thingsorganized okay so I'm going todistribute that gives us 4x cubed minus2x squared I'm going to change the signsto the opposite and add that's reallyjust like subtracting so we get negative6x squared plus 6x plus 10 okay now Isay how many times does 2x go intonegative six x squared that's negative3x and I'm going to distribute okay toboth these terms so it's negative 6xsquared plus 3x I'm going to change thescience to the opposite and add and sothat gives us 3x Plus 10 and then nowwe're trying to see how many times does2x go into 3x that one's a little bittrickier that's three halves I'm goingto distribute we get three X minus threehalves change the signs to the oppositeand add and so that's going to give us10 is really like 20 halves plus 3 is 23halves this is a constant this is alower degree than two x's so that's ourremainder and we're just going to putour remainder over what we're dividingby our divisor and that's it so thisright here is our quotient which is justanother way of saying the answer okaythis is how many times this went in toour polynomial and that's it so this ishow you do polynomial long division I'llsee in the next video
