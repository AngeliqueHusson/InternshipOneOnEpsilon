I'd like to talk about a growth rate inan exponential relationship so I have atable here that is exponential growthand this is about the number of bunniesin a population over time so when theyfirst started collecting data on thebunnies there were a hundred of them andthen after one year there was a hundredand eighty of them and after two yearsthere were 324 so if I want to figureout the growth rate different the growthfactor the growth rate I'm going to lookfrom gear 0 from when we started to year1 it changes from a hundred to 180 so180 minus a hundred means that therewere 80 new rabbits and I started with ahundred and so that means that I had an80% increase because we know thatpercent is out of 100 ok if I look fromyear one to year two I have 324 and yearone I had a hundred and eighty and Istarted with a hundred and eighty in thebeginning of year one when I subtract Ihave a hundred and forty-four out of 180and if I do this division to find whatpercent it is and if you don't rememberhow to to do that you would just do 144divided by 180 and that would give youpoint eight zero or eighty percentincrease so we can say that the rabbitsare increasing by a growth rate of 80percent now that's different than thegrowth factor the growth factor is whatI would need to multiply your zero by toget year one andit turns out I would multiply times 1.8now remember that 80% as a decimal is0.8 the difference between growth rateand growth factor is always 1 so if thegrowth rate is 80% or 0.8 then thegrowth factor would be 1.8
