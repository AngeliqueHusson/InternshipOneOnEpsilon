now we're going to show you how to use acalculator to add and subtract fractionsand in this case we're using a TI 30x acalculator scientific calculator not avery expensive calculator but we canenter fractions into this calculator dothey come do the operations by usingthis button with the a with the B overthe see and that's the entry key buttonfor entering in a fraction let's say wewant to enter in a 5 8 5 so I'm going topress the 5 button and then the a Bbutton and then the 8 and that after welook at that let's look at the displayand the display shows 5 and this littlebackwards L and the 8 that indicates anentry of 5 8 7 5 8 so I want to press inthe operation I'm going to add 5 8 sowe'll press the plus button I'm going toadd 5 8 to 1/4 for the cut so I pressthe 1 the a P and that would be everytime we want the slice you press that awith the B or the C button 1/4 plus andthe a we see the answer up here is seveneight so it's added 1/4 to 5/8 I'm goingto add the next the next cut is 1/2 oneI over b2 and the plus button and theanswer is 1 and while we have this linewhich indicates anything left of thisline is a whole number 3 over 8 so thosethree numbers added together are 3/8 thenext operation is at a quarter to thatfor the cutplus one the egg with the B over the Cbutton and the four you see the displayshowing the entry of one quarter andpress the plus button again I'm going tocontinue to add and the answer is 1 and5/8 and the last cut is 5 6 - we'regoing to put a 5/16 in 5a over B 16 1/6you can see how the entry looks and youpress equals so the answer is 1 and 1516 so that whole number 1 and 15 16 solet's say that we wanted to add 4 and1/2 4 and 1/2 plus 3 and 2/3I press for a B 1 a B and a half so ifyou look at the display it shows 4 and1/2 entered plus 3 a B 2 a B and 3 plus2/3 total together the answers 8 and 1/6we can do the same thing withmultiplication of mixed fractions 5one half five and one half x let's saythree and 1/2 so between every keystrokeI want to enter three and a half I getthree the ABC button I hit the one theABC button in the two and that's beenentered as three and a half and themultiply button and a answer is 19 and aquarter
