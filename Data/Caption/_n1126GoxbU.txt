say I mean you're finally done withtraveling and conferences for thisseason finally moved into your newoffice finally finished and submitted apaper involving four-dimensionalsymmetry groups and monkeys and nowfinally you get to rest you've got awhole free Saturday ahead of you you'regoing to take a break from math doanything but math yes you're going tohang out with your friends and bake soyou go to your friend Gwen Fisher'shouse who makes her living makingmathematical beadwork like this anddesigning instructions and exploring thetheory but cookies aren't beadwork soyou're probably safe for math there thenthere's Ruth of sweets pie Ruth whoknows how to make a good sturdyshortbread and even though she's wellversed in math there should be noproblems because baking and only bakingis a focus of the afternoon also AndreaHawksley is going to join ensure she's asoftware developer who createsmathematical art in her spare time butcome on we're just speaking cookies whatcould go wrong wait what's thattwo-dimensional ruler doing there isthat a square root of two rhombus nowI'm sure it's just because I'm Namrhombus I mean even if you're trying torelax and avoid bath cookies still needto have some shape right hmm as long aswe have these extra little rhombuscutouts might as well stick themtogether but that's when disasterstrikes our natural senses of symmetrycolor patterns infinite tilings on theEuclidean plane we have to have colorsymmetryno when why why do you torture us so noliving thing deserves such torment ohthere we gonice save Andrea tension resolved weextend our tiling just a little bitenjoying how they look like cubes inperspective finishing with an isometricSection I got to pay Gwen back for thecolor pattern thing by focusing on thisfingernail mark morning I'm focusing onthat and after baking the cookie we allgot to torment all through the waltherdog by eating our delicious trip breadruining symmetry ah oh yeahhmm good batter mm-hmm what was the jokeahead short three short short braids ohyeah let's be filter brain reads theirshort braids chirping your bread andshort braids right well maybe we'll justdo one little short braid as a test Imean anyone with a passing interest inmathematics and symmetry probably can'thelp liking braids I've done stuff withthem until has Andrea and Gwen has somecool designs involving them on herbeadwork cable right now and wait Andreahappens to have an unusual five-strandbraid she made us a necklace in her bagwell we definitely need to learn fromher how that worksoh and of course you can't talk aboutbraids without talking about knots andlinks and Gwen wrote a paper involvingthose and has made a bunch of cool onesand look sections of infinite polyhedrathey must resist we're only going tomake a nice simple linked cookie withobligatory discussion of the Bruneianproperty of course which normal braidshave as well as a Borromean rings heresomething burning or not usefulwell now I'm seeing how it's useful Imean right because this says I alwayshave the blue on top of the yellow so Ihave to fiddle with that and then I canjust I don't know that this is gonnalook good when I'm done but I'm notgonna let that stop me from still doingit'll still taste blue yellow and pinkoh the same kind of braid yeah one ofthem got to be a ring the other one'sjealous no this is this is a branch ofthe infinite ring ah Walter look what doyou think looks deliciouswhat do you think she's gonna appreciatethe art he appreciates Oh uhm it'sdelicious Bruni and cookie so the yellowis completely on top of the red the redis completely on top of the blue and theblue is completely on top of the yellowwhich completely just is very counterintuitive and if we flipped it over itwould still be brilliant and Walterwould still want to eat it no back tosimple shapes like hexagons I thinkthey're much more full fruits in ourrhombic dodecahedron try Conda he drewan idea like rhombuses hexagons alsotile the plane though an a periodictiling would be much more fun how aboutthe classic kites and darts we can makeour own cookie cutters out ofcard stock using mythic proportions andthen title them following the matchingrules so many kites so many guys wheream II like to eat these kinds of cookies aperiodically after an a periodic tilingthe simple hexagonal tiling will be soboring so the only reasonable thing todo is glue together the cookies withchocolate ish stuff in 3d to form atruncated octahedron I mean for anyregular polyhedron that is made up oftriangles if you truncate it thosetriangles turn into hexagons and we madethis octahedral dig that brings fourhexagons together at the correct anglesbut we're not sure if our two halves aregoing to go together yeah no there's atheorem that doesn't quite apply hereneeds to be like differentiablecontinuously differentiable it's rigidenough that you can pick it up I woulddrop it I wouldn't try and squeeze ityou could play that with Walter maybe webring it back since the truncatedoctahedron actually workedAndreea starts work on a truncatedicosahedron while I make a card stockjig for holding together cookies at thecorrect angle for a rhombic dodecahedronwhile the edible glue hardens yes nowonder we made a square root to rhombusbecause square root two is a diagonal ofthe square which is what you need forthis octahedral asymmetric polyhedronthough I suppose if we made goldenrhombuses we could have gone for arhombic try Conte Hadrian but anyway therhombic dodecahedron is workingyeah no problem don't drop it in ohthere's a reason oh oh yeah beautifulquick before anything changes there'salways that reminds me a stained glassyeah a play-doh coloring I was justgonna say I have tried making polyhedraout of stained glass and this again thething or doesn't quite fit you just fillin the order this is gonna taste a lotbetter than the solder did it's alsothinners out here chocolate if you useregular chocolate it'd be a lot thickerthis is gonna work I think that workednope obviously we need to make everyshape possible so we're never reallygonna be done somehow andrea comes upwith jigs that work for the truncatedicosahedron a familiar shape sometimesknown as a soccer ball or Bucky ballexcept this one is for eating and notfor kicking though it is made out ofmolecules andmeanwhile Gwen is making an army of tinytetrahedra because sometimes she makes aPinsky tetrahedra out of beads orbaseball bats so of course she has notrouble bending cookies to hermathematical well right on top she'sgonna sit right there a dog Oh dad thatactually worked way better than Ithought it was going to sir police ahdum dum dum dum dum dum dad that is sobeautiful that's the most delicioussoccer ball I've ever seen but in theend we accidentally left Walter alone inthe room for one minute and he ate themall and does not regret it one bit
