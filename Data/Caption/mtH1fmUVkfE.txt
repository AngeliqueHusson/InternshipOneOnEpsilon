statistics Learning Center presentsunderstanding the normal distribution hiI'm doctor mech and in this video I'mgoing to explain what the normaldistribution is and why it is soamazingly useful I will also give someexamples of finding probabilities in anormal distribution this video followson from distributions 3 probabilitydistribution models if you would likeaccess to more of our videos email me atthe address in the comments below allrandom variables have distributions whenwe think of probability distributions wetend to think of the normal distributionwhich is the most well known the normaldistribution is really good for modelingmany natural processes manufacturingprocesses and human endeavors you haveprobably seen it's bell-shaped manytimes the normal distribution has thefollowing characteristics single peakmost data values occur near the mean sothat there is a single peak in themiddle symmetry half of the data valuesmeasured occur above the mean and halfoccur below the mean so that thedistribution is symmetric tapers thefurther you get from the mean the fewerpeople or things occur so thedistribution tapers out in bothdirections caused by multiple factorswhenever there are many differentfactors affecting an outcome we tend toget something that is well modeled by anormal distribution for example if welook at the size of an apple that isaffected by the sunshine wind and rainon every day of its life also it'sgenetics pollination date fertilizer andall sorts of other things so thedistribution of the sizes of apples ofthe same variety would probably resemblea normal distribution each normaldistribution is defined by the mean inthe standard deviation the mean is alsothe median and tells us the midpoint ofthedistribution it is the value aroundwhich all the data values are centeredthe standard deviation tells us abouthow spread out the data is a useful ruleof thumb is that most or 95% of the datavalues will occur within two standarddeviations of the mean it is importantto note that there are also many thingsthat are not well modeled by the normaldistribution many distributions are notsymmetric and have considerable skewoften to the right house prices incomesand human weights are not well modeledwith the normal distribution as therecan be quite a long tail to the righteven test scores in school are notalways well modeled by a normaldistribution but when you add togethermany occurrences from even non-normaldistributions you tend to get a normaldistribution pretty quickly here is anexample of what I mean this is thedistribution of number of ice creamspurchased per customer at Luke's icecream stand it is based on data he hascollected over the last few weeks it isclearly nothing like a normaldistribution we run a simulation of athousand customers and see what thedistribution looks like it is similar tothe original as we would expectwhat say we want to look at what 1,000lots of two customers buy or 1000 lotsof three customers or four customers orten we see that the shape of the graphstarts to look more and more like anormal distribution for ten customers toorder a total of 30 or more ice creamsthey would all need to order about threeice creams each which is pretty unlikelysimilarly it is pretty unlikely that allten people will order just one ice creamfor a total of ten most of the time thevalues will be much less extreme so eventhough the distribution for eachindividual customer is nothing like thenormal once we add even ten customerstogether the resultant distributionmostly resembles the normal distributionthat is why the normal distribution isso usefulwe have looked at the bell-shaped grapha lot in this video and now I'm going toexplain how it worksthat bell-shaped graph is called the PDFor probability density function to findthe probabilities in an outcome iswithin a certain range we look at thearea under the graph within that rangewe could think of it as the probabilitythat a randomly chosen pixel occurs witha net range here is the PDF of a normaldistribution approximating the weight ofLuc's ice-creams there is a mean of 112grams and a standard deviation of 9grams straight off we can say that 95%of all of Luke's ice creams will liewithin two standard deviations of themean this is always true for normaldistributions so we say that 95% or mostice creams weigh between 100 and 12minus 18 which is 94 grams and 112 plus18 which is 130 grams you can see that95% of the area under the graph isbetween 94 grams and 130 grams we canfind out the probabilities of othervalues too Luke wants to know whatproportion of his ice creams are likelyto weigh less than a hundred grams so wewant to find the probability that X isless than 100 which is represented bythe area under the graph to the left ofthe line going up from the number 100 wecan use a calculator a spreadsheet ortables and find the value 0.09 one youcan see that point zero nine one or ninepercent of the area is to the left ofthe number 100 we would expect ninepercent of ice creams to weigh less than100 grams you might want to know howlikely it is that an ice cream weighsexactly a hundred and twenty gramsstrictly speaking the answer is zero isthe probability of any exact value iszero in a continuous distribution thisis because there are infinitely many icecream weights between say a hundred andnineteen point nine and 120 point oneso the probability of any specific valueis 1 over infinity which is zero forexample an ice-cream could weigh 120grams or 120 point zero zero zero zerozero one grams but as scales are onlyaccurate to the nearest gramso they will read 120 grams for anyice-cream weighing between 100 andnineteen point five grams and 120 pointfive grams we can find the probabilityof an ice-cream weights being in thatinterval and the answer to that is zeropoint zero three practically speakingthree percent of the ice creams will bemeasured as weighing a hundred andtwenty grams this video was brought toyou by statistics Learning Center visitour website for more resources to helpyou learn
