in geometry we can look at a figure andsay that it has symmetry if there's anisometry that will map part of thefigure back onto itself well an isometryremember is a rigid transformation thatis a translation a rotation orreflection we could be more specifichowever for certain objects and say thatthey have rotational symmetry an objecthas rotational symmetry if that figureis itself after you rotate it less than180 degrees if it is itself afterexactly 180 degrees no more no less thenthat figure has point symmetry so let'slook at a couple different figures hereand try to determine if it hasrotational symmetry and if so what thedegree is so here we have an equilateraltriangle and in my head if I rotate thisI can definitely map it back onto itselfso if I draw in some lines here that'llintersect right there I see that if allthree of these are congruent which theyare since it's an equilateral trianglethen they all must be 120 degrees so yesthis has rotational symmetry and afterevery 120 degrees of rotation it will beitself so how many degrees of rotationalsymmetry does this have it has 120degrees if we look at this figure righthere we have 1 2 3 congruent linesegments intersecting each other andit's pretty clear again that I couldrotate this and have it map back ontoitself well since there are sixcongruent angles we're going to have todo 360 divided by 6well 3 and 60 divided by 6 is 60 degreesso this figure right here has 60 degreesof rotational symmetry last we look atthis plus sign if I had drawn thisperfectly it's pretty clear that afterthat there are 4 ways that we can rotatethis so if we take 360 degrees and werotate it 4 differentit's pretty clear that this will have 90degrees of rotational symmetry so againrotational symmetry what does it mean itmeans that you can rotate it less than180 degrees and the figure will beexactly the same and if you can rotateit exactly 180 degrees so let's say wehad a figure kind of like this you seethat if I rotate it exactly 180 degreesit will be itself
