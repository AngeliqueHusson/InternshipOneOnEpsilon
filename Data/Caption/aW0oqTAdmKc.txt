so what's Euler's theorem basically whatit is is when you're dealing withpolyhedron okay these arethree-dimensional shapes made out ofpolygons you figured out this formulathat the number of faces plus the numberof vertices equals the number of edgesplus two so if you know two of thesethree quantities you can find themissing quantity and I'll show you someexamples but just to explain a littlefurther the faces are basically thesides okay of this 3-dimensionalpolyhedron okay and they're polygons sothey're like rectangles squarestriangles Pentagon's you know that typeof thing the vertices these are thepoints okay these are the points wherethe line segments come together okaythat make up the polygon they cometogether at a point those are calledvertices and then the edges are wherethe faces come together and they form aline segments so I'll show you what Imean in a couple of these examples sothis one over here you can see lookskind of like a cube maybe it's a squareprism maybe it's a rectangular prism butthe main thing is let's look at thenumber of faces so you can see there's arectangle on the right the left abovebelow front and back so you basicallyhave six facesokay now let's count the vertices thevertices are these points so it's onetwo three four at the base five sixseven eight at the top so there's eightvertices and then the number of edges 12 3 4 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 so there's 4 atthe top 4 at the bottom and 4 on thesides so that's 12 plus 2 more let's seeif it makes sense 14 equals 14 okay itchecks out now let's take a look atanother example this one is a pentagonalpyramid the base is a pentagon you cansee it's made up of five triangles okayand it comes to a point here at the topso if we count the number of facesthere's the one at the bottom that's thePentagon five and then there's fivetriangles all the way around so we knowthat there's six faces okay now thenumber of vertices those are easy tocount one two three four five and sixand let's just leave the number of edgesblank for a minute let's just do a plustwo so this is 12 equals e plus two ifwe subtract twoyou can see the number of edges shouldbe 10 let's see if we can verify thatthere is 1 2 3 4 5 at the bottom becauseit's a pentagon 5 sides and then you cansee there's 6 7 8 9 and 10 so that makessense there's 10 edges last example wehave a triangle triangular pyramid butprism because you have two bases thatare parallel congruent a pyramid justhas one base it comes to a point prismhas two bases that are parallelcongruent and they're separated by theheight so here we can see that there'stwo bases and there's three rectanglesand make up the side so that's the sideso that's five faces there's 1 2 3 4 5 6vertices so 6 points ok and if we lookat the number of edges we have 1 2 3 4 56 7 8 9 3 at the top 3 at the bottom 3on the side so three line segments times3 ok so that's 9 plus 2 more so 11equals 11so you got it so if you had a morecomplicated shape you know that maybehad a lot more sides a lot more faces byjust solving for two of these quantitiesyou could solve for the missing thirdquantity so I hope this helped youunderstand euler's theorem a little bitbetter go ahead and subscribe to thechannel check out some of my many otherpast videos and I look forward to seeingyou in the future ones I'll talk to yousoon
