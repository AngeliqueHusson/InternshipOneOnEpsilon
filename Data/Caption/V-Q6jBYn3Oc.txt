welcome let's talk about syntheticdivision this is a very amassed fordividing one polynomial by a linear termit's often presented in school curriculaas a nice speedy method that gets theresults very quickly but it's usuallypresented in a way that's completelydevoid of understanding and it remainscompletely mysterious kids usually endup just memorize the procedure which hasno real value in the end understandingserves as much a better purposes thanthan just doing stuff for the sake ofspeed and for doing it let me go throughthe synthetic division process by notdoing it let me just talk aboutpolynomial division in general and showhow we can do far more powerful thingsall coming from an understanding ratherthan just memorizing and to get there wefirst need to understand how we multiplypolynomials let's do a very simpleexample suppose I wanted to take xsquared plus 2x minus 2 and multiplythat by say 2x plus 3 keep it fairlysimple well in some very basic sensemultiplication is really the geometryproblem of computing the area say areaof a rectangle here's a rectangle oneside is going to be X plus 2 X minus 2inches long there all is going to be 2xplus 3 inches long but too explicit areanegative divisor to side that's 2xinches long and side that's 3 incheslong and I guess my area malls gonna bea little stretched here x squared 2x andnegative 2 so I'm dividing one sidelengths up to three pieces one happensto be negative two inches long okay so Iadmit my dream each model is littleextended here but the algebra implied bythis model is after the appropriatealgebra so I'm gonna do is take thesesix pieces and look at their individualareas and what will I getwell this piece x squared times 2x is 2xcubed and then I get this piece here isx squared times 3 that's the 3x squaredthis is a 4x squared piece I can do itany order like this is minus 4x this isnegative 6 and this piece here is 3times 2x that 6x and then for the areathe product of the two polynomials mustbe the sum of all six pieces but there'sa nice feature in laying it out this waynotice how all the powers of airterms of the same pair of X are lined onthe diagonal so I see the answer isactually 2 X cubed plus 7 x squared plus2 X's minus 6 so there's a area approachto working out the product ofpolynomials is mighty dandy it'sactually called the Galle method if youwant to do some more simple arithmeticnot in base exponent base ten it's outthere okay but while I'm interested inis doing this problem backwards that iscan we use this this a rectangle methodthis Galli method and do the reverse nowI take the same problem and I canpretend I don't know the answer we got2x cubed plus 7x squared plus 2x minus 6this time I want to divide it by 2x plus3 I've just done the rectangle method soI mean I don't know the answer but heregoes can i reconstruct it based on theanswer and one of the sides well hereyou have one of the sides was 2x + 3 andthe answer came from the diagonals thereare 1 2 3 4 terms I need a rectanglewith 4 diagonalshere's one diagonal 2 diagonals 3diagonals4 diagonals okay so this first diagonalis 2x cubed this next diagonals 7xsquared next angles 2x and the followedangle is negative 6 the answer to thisdivision problem is the missing side ofthis rectangle can I work out thesethree pieces well the answer is yes hegoes um I'm gonna advise us when we domore complex root work there turbanthere and things Q mismatches andremainders to start on the top leftcorner now this only one term this cellthat gives the diagonal this cell mustbe 2x cubed which tells me this numbersomething times 2x is 2x cubed no choicethis must be x squared well knowingthat's x squared at the top this piecehere must be 3 times x squared + 3 xsquared great it's like a little Sudokupuzzlecan I keep going and logically deducewhat happens next well yes look I've got7 X squares and so far I've only gotthree of themthis piece must be 4x squaredso something x 2 X is 4 squaredthis better be 2 X now we'll set to workat this cell down here 2x times 3 thisbetter be 6x oh I only wanted two x's sothis diagonal must be negative 4 X isthen what's that tell me about thispiece up here it's negative 2 in fact Ican stop now there's the answer that xsquared plus 2x minus 2 but just as alittle soft check what's the final piecenegative 2 times 3 is negative 6and yes that matches the final diagonalso this is the perfect division problemthere's no no remainders to tell with sohere we go I've just done polynomialdivision is the answer is x squared plus2x minus 2 grandthat's a piece of cake let's do anotherone let me just give you this time I'lljust give you the answers but no part ofthe question 2x squared plus 7x plus 6or divided by X plus 2 this is an areaproblem basically I've given you thediagonals and I've given you one side soone side is definitely X plus 2 there itis now the question is how manydiagonals and I'm going to need I needone two three diagonals one for theunits one for the X is 1 for the XSquared's so how many columns does itmean there's a couple of ways to thinkabout this if I just try to columnsdoes it give me 3 diagonals yes so I canstop there or another way to think aboutthis is I'm going to have x squareddivided by something with X's so myanswers probably have something was justa single X in it so I need a column forX's and a column for units and nothingmore so any of the units here on the X'sand nothing more and in fact two columnsis right we've seen that does give threediagonals all right so one diagonal istwo x squared and other diagonal is 7 Xand the file diagonal 6 now can I useproject to juice my way through thistable look at what the other side of therectangle must be well yes there's onlyone cell that gives 2x that gives thisdiagonal this this top-left cornermust be 2x square itself which meanssomething times X is 2x squared soforces to talk to be 2xtwo x times two x forces this sellsbefore X but I wanted seven X's on thisdiagonalthere's better be 3x something times Xis 3x it's got to be 3 which means thecell is 6 and that all fits togetherperfectly so I now know that 2x squaredfor 7x plus 6 divided by X plus 2 is 2xplus 3 by the way that's syntheticdivision synthetic division is a way ofjust codifying all the numbers thatappear in this table without actuallydrawing the the table itself or writingany X's however a synthetic divisionthat codifying method only works forlinear terms I prefer writing it all outI don't mind spending the extra 10seconds actually writing out X's and Xsquares and executors and so forthbecause I have the power to do reallycomplicated division problems now forwhich the synthetic division as it'staught in schools would be useless onfor example here's something that looksa horrendous 4 X to the 6th minus 6 X tothe 5th plus that's what must make thisminus sorry minus X to the 4th plus 3xcubedwhoops plus 4 x squared minus 7 X plus 3and for some reason that's unbeknownstto anyone in the world including me Iwanted to buy this by x squared minus 2xplus 1 okay I'm gonna do it it's comingfrom a rectangle synthetic division isnot set up to deal with quadratic termsokay that met them to fail however Iknow that denominator it's telling me Iwant a rectangle coming from one sidelength that's three pieces x squarednegative 2x + 1 now how many columns I'mgoing to need I need one two three fourfive six seven diagonals but if I pickmy way through it but X to the sixththat's going to be divided by X to thesquare so I'm happy so much dealing withX to the fourth so I'm gonna need tohave units one and they'd have X's boomI need to have X Squared's I need tohave X cubes and I need to have X to thefourth and hopefully just as a littledouble-check that gives me three fourfiveseven diagonals the first diagonal is 4X to the sixthall right I think she's not gonna botherwriting these down and keep looking atthis enumerator that 4 of X or 16 canonly possibly come from one cell the topleft cell sometimes support the SEPAtimes x squared to support X to thesixth see four X to the fourth which theforces this guy to be negative eight Xto the fifth and forces the sky to befour X to the fourthlook at the negative six x to the fifthnow that can only come from this seconddiagonal this must be 2 X to the fifthall right to the X to the fifthsomething times x squared is 2x to thefifth this must be 2 X cubedall right therefore let's move completethe rest of the column this has to benegative 4 X to the fourth and this mustbe 2 X cubed all right let's look at thenext diagonalI need negative x to the 4th over 4 tothe 4th negative 4 X to the 4thok they've cancelled out but still neednegative x to the 4th that's thatdiagonal that means this must benegative x squaredforcing this to be 2 X cubed forcingthis to be negative x squared now lookat the next diagonal 3 X cubed right nowI've got 4 X cubesthis better be negative x cubed whichmeans this must be minus X minus x timesX squares negative x cubed so this isactually 2 x squared this is actuallynegative x next diagonal 4 X Squared'sright now I have 1 X squares this betterbe 3 X Squared's and let's see thismeans this better be 3 which means thisnote better be negative 6x and thisbetter be 3 and I'm done but as a checkI know check this father died ignored Ihave negative 7 X yes and so I was thepenultimate one here's the final one and0 3 yes everything's hanging togetherI've just before on polynomial divisionand I see the answer is 4 to the fourthwas 2 X cubed minus x squared minus Xplus 3 that's itthat is synthetic division withunderstanding and is more powerful butthe synthetic division they
