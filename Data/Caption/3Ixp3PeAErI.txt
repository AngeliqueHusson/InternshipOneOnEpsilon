all right in this video and I do onemore example of finding the center andradius of a circle and again what we'regoing to do is we're just going to usecompleting the square to to rewrite ourequation and put it in the center radiusform so we're going to start with 4xsquared plus 4y squared minus 16x plus24 y minus 36 the first thing I'm goingto do just to make the numbers all alittle more manageable kind of oneobservation they're all even socertainly I can divide them by two but Ithink we can even do better than thatbecause I believe four will go into allof these numbers so that's the veryfirst thing I'm going to do is I'm justsimply going to divide everything on theleft by four so we have to also dividethe right by four well four x squaredover four is just x squared four Ysquared over four will be with positiveY squared negative 16x over 4 would benegative 4x positive 24 over 4 would bepositive 6y negative 36 divided by 4would be negative 9 and then 0 dividedby 4 is 0 what I'm going to do next isI'm going to kind of regroup things herea little bit I'm going to put the X'snext to each other and I'm going to putthe Y's next to each other so notice wehave an x squared we've got negative 4xand then we've got positive Y squaredhanging out we've got a positive 6y andthe other thing I'm going to do is I'mgoing to add the 9 over to the rightside so again I kind of imagine you knowI I'm going to stick my X's and a set ofparentheses if there's any coefficient Ifactor it out we don't have to worryabout that stuff hereI'm going to give myself a little spacethe same thing for the wise I'm justgoing to give myself a little space soagain completing the square it says wetake 1/2 of the coefficient on thelinear term so 1/2 of negative 4 in thiscase will be negative 2 we then takenegative 2 and square it which will giveus positive 4 and this number is thenumber that we just kind of magicallythrow inside the parentheses so plus 4the same thing for the Y's we'll havelet's see if we take 1/2 of thecoefficient which is 6 that will give uspositive 3 and then 3 squared again ispositive 9 so again I'm going to add a 9to the left side in that set ofparentheses on the right side we had a 9hanging out already but again reallywhat did we do on the left side on theleft side we added a 4 and we added a 9so I've got to do that to the right sideas well and now again we're almost therex squared minus 4x plus 4 that factorsnicely has X minus 2 squared y squaredplus 6y plus 9 that factors is y plus 3quantity squared let's see 9 + 4 is 13plus another 9 is 22 and now we put thisin our familiar center radius form itsays the center of our circle is goingto be as the x-coordinate of positive 2and the y-coordinate of negative 3 andthen the radius of our circle is simplygoing to be the square root of 22 whichfactors is 2 times 11 that doesn'treally break down any further so I wouldprobably just you know leave it alonehereso again completing the square a littletedious but hopefully not not tooterribly bad
