before we get to its volume and surfacearea let us understand what a cone isthis is what a right circular cone lookslike it has a circular base and a curvedsurface and it has just one vertex letus understand it with animation usingaleca software we can form a cone bymoving this right triangle around thisaxis like this we have a cone here thisis its curved surface and this is itscircular base this line passing throughthe vertex and the center of thecircular base is called its axis it'sright circular since its axis isperpendicular to the ground let's getback to our figure let this be thecentral axis and let this be the radiusof the base the axis is perpendicular tothe base this cone on the other hand isnot right circular since its axis is notperpendicular to the ground henceforthwhenever we see a cone mentioned in anexample we are referring to a rightcircular cone there are three littlethings we need to understand in a conefirst its perpendicular height H secondit slant height L and third the radiusof the circular base R the first thingyou should notice is the right trianglethat is formed so by the Pythagorastheorem l squared will equal R squaredplus h squared this tells us that if weknow any of the two parameters the thirdone can be easily found we erase thisand move to a new page here we try towork out the surface area of the conethe surface area of the cone will be thesum of areas of two surfaces one thecircular base and two this curvedsurface with the radius given we caneasilyfind the area of this circular base butwhat about this curved surface we aren'tfamiliar with the shape this curvedsurface if cut opened will look likethis it's just slightly opened becauseof the cut and this when opened furtherwill look like a sector of a circle thearea of this sector will be the curvedsurface area of the cone and the sum ofthe areas of this sector and thecircular base will equal the totalsurface area now all we need to do isfind the surface area of each of thesefigures and solving for the surface areaof each is extremely interesting we willsee that in the next video
