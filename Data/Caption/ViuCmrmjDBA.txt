welcome to my secret math tutor we'regonna work on a really quick example onhow to add functions together so inorder to do this you need a couple offunctions and fortunately I got a coupleright here f is 2x squared minus 3x andg7 X plus 3 so what I want to do isbasically add the two together and ifyou've seen problems like this you mayhave noticed notation that looks likethiswell what this basically says is add Fand G together use X as your input nowthat's pretty good notation but use thealternate notation to see whereeverything will go ok so this is thealternate notation it means the samething but now I can see that yeah I'mbasically going to take whatever F isand add it to whatever G is alright sonow that my brain is in gear let's goahead and substitute in the expressionfor F and the expression for G and seewhat we getso F is 2x squared minus a 3 X and G is7 X plus 3 and of course both thesethings are being added together there wego now keep in mind that after you takethe two functions or write them downlike that you may be able to simplifythem just a bit in fact because of thetwo functions I chose I can actuallycombine these X's right here so a minus3x and a plus 7x those that guysactually combine so this will give me a2x squared plus 4x plus 3 so this isbasically a new function now thatrepresents the sum of F and G and therewe go if you'd like to see some morevideos please visitmysecretmathtutor.com
