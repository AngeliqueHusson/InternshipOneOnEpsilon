[Music]okay I just want to quickly go over likewhat does this mean when we have a iscongruent to B mod urn and all thefollowing are pretty much equivalent anddepending on the situations you caninterpret them differently okay soperhaps the first thing I want to tellyou just that when we have a iscongruent to B mod and this means that aand B have the same remainder and I willput on quotation mark for the worldremainder because sometimes when we aretalking about this kind of things youmay end up with negative remainders andthings like that so that's pretty muchideas that's why I put down for this moda and B have the same remainder whenthey are divided by and okay and by theway and should be a pasty whole numbergreater than 1 so 2 3 4 5 so on do notever say and is equal to 1 mod 1 killseverythingdon't do that ok you're pretty much justkilling all the math killing all thenumbers UV so don't do thatok so this is the first way to interpretthis notation a and B have the sameremainder when we divide a by n when weT PI P by n so that's the first thingthe second thing is that I can write thefollowing when we have AIDS compared toPima and we can say a it's equal to wellit's just going to be off by a motorport and and usually we can just say Ktimes for some number K which we don'tknow yet just keep it as how D is fornow and then you add B to it and you seewhen you modern this right here Statesas a for you have K times n man this isalways going to be a multiple and so itbecomes zero in the modern world andthen you left with the beaver here ok sosometimes it may be helpful when you gofrom here to here because from hereyou're working with an equation ratherthana Congress so that's another way to usethis notation or say another way tointerpret another way to approach whenyou have a Congress the next thing isthat okay I can just subtract B on bothsides right and if you stop championboth sides you can see that a minus B isequal to K times n in other word a minusB it's a multiple of and right so I canactually go from here and tell you guysthat divides into a minus B and onceagain this right here has a few ways tointerpret it this is actually the commonnotation that we'll be using quite oftenthis right here you say that deviceokay and when we write this downthis means the me just please time to donot why notthis means that a minus B is a multipleof and okay so that's the idea so that'spretty much it right I think this isjust a perhaps the most natural way toknow what that means and this right hereit's pretty useful when you're trying tosolve one equation from congruence rightyou change your Congress to an equationfirst and then this right here is usefulwhen you're doing some proofs andperhaps I will just give you guys aquick example okay so this is just aquick example so let's do easy one I'llsay let's say we have 10 okay and that'scongruent to 14 mod what is this yes yeswhy because when you have pad divided by4 this right here gives you 2 with aremainder 2 right so this right here ispretty much 2 and then right here whenyou to 14 divided by 4 you get 3 withthe remainder 2 as well so they have thesame remainder and once again sometimesyou may be dealing with naked number andI can also tell you guys that tan iscongruent to negative 2 mod 4 okayand this is two on the left-hand sidethis is negative two but the truth isthat you can just go from negative twoand you add 4 to it negative 2 plus 4this is also the same as 2 mod 4 okay sothat's the ideanow the second thing is perhaps that thetrickier because I told you guys we havethis huhand I want to write this down okay a ismy 10 right here based on the orderingthis is the first way the second thingis that I will write 10 it's equal to KI don't know yet multiplied by 4 andthen we add B which is 14 well 10 isequal to what times 4 plus 14 this is 14I just need to have negative 1 so thatcan get negative 4 plus 14 which is 10so came this case will be negative 1 Kand a and B they are all integers andthe third way as I said auntie fightingto a minus B so and it is 4 divides intoa minus B which is 10 minus 14 anotherwhat we're saying that 4 divides intonegative 4 why because we know negative4 it's equal to 4 times negative 1 thisis a multiple okay and once again we areloading negative numbers like this rightso hopefully this right here makeseverything clear and from here I feelmuch better because now I can just tellyou guys about these things in my number3 videos and stay tuned let me know ifyou guys have any questions or anycomments or suggestions and at themoment that's it[Applause]
