assume we are given that the perimeterof a quadrilateral is 40 centimeters ifthis is the only piece of information wehave how many water laterals do youthink we can draw yesinfinite that's correct we can draw arectangle like this with a breadth of 8and a length of 12 centimeters theperimeter will be 8 plus 12 plus 8 plus12 which is 40 centimeters we can alsohave a rectangle like this with abreadth of 2 and a length of 18centimeters the perimeter will be 2 plus18 plus 2 plus 18 which again is 40centimeters and we can also have asquare with each side be 10 centimeterslong of course we can also havequadrilaterals other than rectangles andsquares but for now let's just considerthese let's find out the area of eachthe area of the first figure will be 12times 8 which is 96 square centimetersthe area of the second figure is 2 times18 which equals 36 square centimetersnotice that the area of the secondfigure is smaller than that of the firstand what will be the area of this squareit will be 10 times 10 which equals 100square centimeters the area of thesquare is the largest and guess what italways will be given the perimeter of aquadrilateral the square has the largestarea this is a key concept given theperimeter of a quadrilateral the squarehas the largest area and does it workfor triangles - absolutely it's the samefor equilateral triangles do for anygiven perimeter of a triangle thetriangle with all its sides equal willhave the maximum area what about thereverse what if we are given the areathe area of a quadrilateral is 36 squarecentimeters the area is 36 so we canhave a rectangle like this with breadth2 centimeters and lengths 18 centimetersarea would be 18 times 236 squarecentimeters we can have a rectangle likethis with breath 4 and length 9centimeters the area would still be 36square centimeters or it could be asquare with side 6 centimeters 6 times 6is also 36 let's analyze the parametersthe perimeter of the first figure willbe 40 centimeters the perimeter of thesecond one will be 4 plus 9 plus 4 plus9 26 centimetersand the perimeter of the square will be6 times 4 24 centimeters the perimeterof the square is the least for a givenarea of a quadrilateral the perimeter ofthe square will be the least so this wasthe second concept we learned the firstconcept said that for the givenperimeter of a quadrilateral the squarehas the largest area
