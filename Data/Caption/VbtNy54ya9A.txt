Hi there, everyone.I'm Brady, and I make the
Numberphile videos.And this is a bit of a
supplementary video for ourone about Benford's Law.Now hopefully you've already
watched that, and you knowwhat Benford's Law is.But just a reminder, everything
we're talking abouthere pertains to the
first digit ofall these big numbers.So let's get into it.What we've done is an analysis
of the statistics ofNumberphile videos to find out
whether or not they'refollowing Benford's Law.Now I'd love to say I did
this myself, but it's abit beyond my skills.I was helped by a very clever
man named Daniel, sothank you to him.So what I've done is I've given
Daniel the duration ofevery Numberphile video in
seconds, the number of timesit's been viewed, and the number
of comments that havebeen made on each video.So what he's done is he's looked
at the first digit ofall those numbers and plotted
them on a graph, finding outwhat digit is most commonly at
the start of the number.And here's the graph.Now let's look at these
one by one.First of all, there's
the durations.And for those of you who
remember what a good Benfordcurve looks like, well,
it looks like this.So we haven't got a
very good match.Let's look at the view counts.Now, number one is definitely
the most common digit at thestart of the view counts,
followed by number two.That's as it should be.But it goes a bit wrong there
at the end, doesn't it?Let's try the number
of comments oneach Numberphile video.Again, number four seems to come
up more than you wouldhave expected.Number one is still the
top, but I don't know.It's not quite Benford-esque,
is it?So the Numberphile statistics
don't seem to quite befollowing the way we hoped.Maybe that's because it's not
a big enough sample size.We've only done just over
100 Numberphile videos.But for those of you who are
familiar with my otherchannels, yes, I do have quite a
few other channels, so thoseof you who are familiar with
those other channels might beaware that I've made, well,
well over 1,000 videos onYouTube now.That's a bigger sample size.So I sent the statistics for
all those videos to Daniel,and he did the same thing.Let's find out what
happened there.So these are the steps
for all my channels.And let's go through
them one by one.First of all, the durations.There we go.Not Benford-esque, is it?In fact, number one's
not even top.Number three is the most
common first digit.Now, we've had a bit of a talk
about this, and we've got afew theories as to why the
durations aren't working.But rather than putting them
here in the video, I thoughtit might be more fun for you
to think about it, proposewhat you think's going
on, and put them incomments under the video.There's also a blog where we've
gone into it, and again,there will be links under the
video in the full description,so have a look at that.But enough about durations.Let's look at the view counts,
and the number of comments.Plotting the view counts on all
my videos, the most commonfirst digit is 1, followed
by 2, followed by 3,4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.And the curve?Well, quite Benford-esque.Not bad, eh?And looking at the number of
comments, again, remember thisis the first digit
in these numbers.Have a look at that.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.Again, a lovely Benford
curve there.So it looks like even the
YouTube viewing statistics andthe number of comments are
following a Benford curve.Now as I said, more
information,links under the video.Thank you to Daniel for
helping me out.Thank you for all the other
people who volunteered to helpme out when I put out
the plea for help.And we'll have more
videos soon.And leave a comment
under this one.Let's see if we can get this
one outside the curve.
