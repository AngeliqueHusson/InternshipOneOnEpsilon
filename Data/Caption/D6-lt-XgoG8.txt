g'day welcome to tech bath Channel whatwe're going to be having a look at inthis video is ratios and proportion okayand pretty much how we can see whetheror not two sets of ratios are inproportion so what do I mean by thiswell consider we have two ratios are st.was the amount of cordial we wereputting in water and I'll draw theamount of cordial in red we had threeparts cordial for every seven parts ofwater I'll put the water in blue thereand then I was comparing this to adifferent class of water where this timewe had six parts cordial for everyfourteen parts of water so say I wantedto see whether or not these glasses werethe same strength that is they are inproportion to one another these ratioswere equivalent now how could I do thisthere's a couple ways I could do thisnow first off this is a fairly simpleexample so I go this nice simple way ofdoing it if we have a look at thecordial first off what's happened is wehave three parts in this one and sixparts in this one so what we have is twotimes as much cordial as we go from oneglass to the other as we have a look atthe water we have seven parts here andfourteen parts here so seven to fourteenis also a double e so these ratios aresaid to be in proportion these classesof cordial would have that same strengthokay so you could use this whether ornot you're looking at pictures orsomething like this okay and so what wecan have a look at in this video iswe're going to have a look at how we cansimply see where there are two sets ofratios that are in proportion that isare they equivalent and also how we caneasily determine how much of eachquantity is required to keep somethingequivalent to keep two sets of ratiosequivalent okay how to keep them inproportion sowhat about I'll show you first off howweakened all this very simply and theway we're going to do this is throughthis method method of crossmultiplication so when you're comparingtwo ratios I'm going to call them a isto be what I call the second ratio C isto D and if we wanted to see whetherthese we in proportion well the firstthing we do is we write these asfractions so I want to write this as aover B and I'm going to write the secondratio as C over D now we're going topretend are these guys equal and nowthen what we do is we cross multiplywhat I mean by this is we're going tomultiply this number by this number andthen I'm going to multiply this one bythis one okay and if they areapportioned what we should end up withis the same result that is to say atimes D should equal C times B and thisidea we're going to use to work out awhole bunch of things okay so bear withus and I'll show you what I mean by thisso let's consider two ratios here okayso we had a look at two ratios and theseare those we're going to have a look atwhat about for is 214 and we're going tohave a look at six is 221 and I want tosee whether these are in proportion okayso I'm going to write them first off asfractions for over fourteen and six isto twenty one is going to become sixover 21 pretty much what we're seeing isare these two fractions equivalent solet's have a look we're going to crossmultiply opposites at this one timesthis one so 4 times 21 is 84now we're going to do is we're gonnamultiply this one by this one six timesfor de is also eighty-four because theseguys are equal to one anotherthese guys are sent to these two ratiosare said to be in proportion what aboutanother example here so that's how youcan test to see whether or not tworatios are in proportion if those tworesults of the cross multiplication areequal to one anotherwhat about another set sales having alook at 13 is to 15 and I was comparingthis to a second ratio of 6 is to 7 sothe first thing we do we write them asfractions 13 over 15 and we're going towrite this one as 6 over 7 now whatwe're going to do is we're going tocross multiply again 13 times 7 is 91 15times 6 is 90 now you're going to lookthey're pretty close but there arethey're not the same number at all sothese two ratios are not in proportionokay so that's how you can use crossmultiplication to work out whether ornot two ratios are in proportion we canalso use this to solve some other typesof proportion problems such as where wewant to know how much we need to are sayadd in a quantity to keep two ratios inproportion okay so I'll give you anexample this so we had we had a recipeand in this recipe what it said is weneeded one cup of rice and three cups ofwater so we have this ratio of rice toorder of 1 is to 3okay one part one cup of rice three cupsof water and what I wanted to know issay I had five cups of water how muchrice would I add how much to keep thisin that same ratio now this one here wedo not know Ohdown oh no what happened there I'm goingto put this one down as okay X that's anunknowing all right and this is howwe're going to solve this a bit of a bitof algebra magic here so what we do iswe first set these up as fractions oneis the three and this one is X thisunknown number over five if you probablysee what we're going to do here we'regoing to do this cross multiplicationright what we're going to do this numbertimes this number one times five is fivethis number is this one by this one 3times X is 3x and remember we're tryingto keep these equivalent okay so what wecan now do is we can just solve X likeyou are do in a bit of our basic algebraso we divide 3 into both sides so if wedivide this side by 3 we're going to getrid of this and this one is going to be5 over 3 okayequals X 5 divided by 3 is 1 with 2remainder so we get that as 1 and 2/3 soyou see how that worksso that's how we can use this are youjust have to set your your question upto be you know that which ratios butthen you just for the unknown ones putan X okay what about another examplewould be able to go the other riceanother rice for example here what aboutwe are we had 2 cups of rice and itwould serve 6 people it's going to be a2 to 6 ratio and okay so we invite thisis rice to people let me invite elevenpeople to a particular shindig thatwe're doing and we want to know how muchrice we need to cook to cook ok so thisis the unknown now we're going to callthis X I can set them up as fractionsthis is 2 over 6 this is x over 11 okayKenickie bears cause equal let's crossmultiply two times 11 is 22 okay just goon this one times this one now this isequal to 6 times X 6x once again we'regoing to divide now we gotta get this Xby itself so we're going to divide bothsides by 6 this 6x divided by 6well it's just X and 22 divided by 6 so22 divided by 6 is equal to X so this is3 cupsokay this 22 divided by 6 is 3 6 3 to 18with 4 over 6 and we could simplify thatfurther into 3 and 2/3 so you see theway that works okay anyway hopefullythat helps you out that's a way that wecan work out how to keep things inproportion and that sort of deal anywaywe'll see you next time bye
