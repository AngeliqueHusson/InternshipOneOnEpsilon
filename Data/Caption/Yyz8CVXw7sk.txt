we've been looking so far at all thesedifferent kinds of wines how they relateto each other most recently we've beenlooking at these guys parallel lines nowyou look if you take a pair of parallellines let's draw a couple on your pageokay to indicate that these lines areparallel what did we dothree couple of arrows on like sun thattells you they're going at the samedirection okay that's great now whenyou've got the parallel I said not thatinteresting because they didn't have atouch each other they never a draft butif we have a way that crosses both ofthose which we call it our transversalokay a line like that you might laterthen things start to get interestingokay now by the way dear member why isit called a transversal that's aterrible awkward long name why is itcalled a transversal because it'stransversing it's cutting across rightthese other two lines so it's literallythe crossing line that's what it meansokay now last time what you had a lookat was corresponding anglescorresponding angles because when you'vegot this transversal it cuts across itmakes a whole bunch of new angles hereright just two parallel lines no anglesbut wait you've got these transversalgoing across you've got a whole bunch infact if I'm counting right you've gotone two three four five six seven eightangles that are formed and they relateto each other in very very importantways yescorresponding wines ankles sorry for youokay now this is what you looked at lasttime okay so for instance if I call thisangle actually let's up let's put somelabels on this dictionary because youguys know how to talk about angles youknow how to describe them and name themso let's call this line a B let's callthis one C D and a log here we'll callthis P Q is s for not not okay now iffor instance I wanted to talk about thisangle here right that angle right up inthere how would we name it there's a fewdifferent ways that are all valid okaycould someone give me one suggestionyeah angle Hur okay sirremember you have your angle symbolthere which literally it looks like anangle okay angle a QR that's perfect Ithink because aq is one of the arms cuteours the other arm and Q that point inthe middlewhat's that this especially great nowthis angle here we say it corresponds toanother one of those eight angles thatare on it now that we've labeled thisthing can you see which angle does itcorrespond to can we name itokay now you can't say ah but there's aproblem with that isn't there cuz ah itcould be a whole bunch of angles rightthere's one two three four angles thatare all at us so we need to be a littlemore specific great see our yes okay sothese two angles right now these two itwas here are corresponding angles youcan see the disabilities so this isrevision right because they'recorresponding angles we can say thatthey're equal to each otherdo you remember this knots learning ifyou're everybody yes okay good now thereason for this you can't just say arethey're equal because cuz I want them tobe okay you have to providejustification a reason for why that'strue okay so on the side here you wantto provide the reason you would saycorresponding angles now you got to Isee you can either say on parallel linesbless you on parallel lines are equalbut I like to put a little more detailman okay and it's actually a little bitshorter to say I'm not just gonna sayparallel lines I'm gonna say whichparallel lines I have right which of thelines are parallel a B and C D right sirto say that to write down it they'reparallel I can say corresponding anglesoh now do you remember what's the symbolthat we have for parallel lines it'sliterally just a pair of parallel linesthat's convenient isn't it okay chorus20 and goes on a B which is parallel toCD they're equalokay so see these two lines either ofthem are fine I think this is a bitnicely because it gives you a littlemore detail even though I don't havethem right now if I had more parallellines going all over the place it mightbe confusing which ones are you talkingabout right so this actually gives you abit more detail and if you have a lookat it it's actually a bit shorter tooright so this is kind of a this is okaybut I like this even better okay sothere you go yeah totally I it's reallygood when laziness equals more detailthat's that's a we usually see the wayaround but anyway okay now just beforewe move off that there's a lot of othercorresponding angles too right forinstance if we went P Q B if I caught itthis angle up here put the top on it heyP Q B what would be the anglecorresponding to P B have a look at itcould someone give me a hand up and tellme whichs T okay now it had to be this angle inheels right now be careful because thisis tricky it's really hard to it becauseit's surfing angles here rightis it corresponding okay now I don'tthink it is and he's how I know hisnever second is right I like to look atthis angle P Q B right and which way isit facing okay maybe the way I've drawnit's kind of facing up yesnow corresponding one of the synonymsfor corresponding is matching right soin other words these angles are doingthe same thing right so this guy is kindof facing up that way right I want tolook for another angle that's facing inthe same direction right which to me isvery close to SRD but I think it's onthe other side because this guy's goingoff on that direction see how they sortof look so cute ah deep this angle hereokay now let's just test it now itdoesn't actually check it out whatdirection is it facing what's going thatway and that does look like it'smatching together okay now please don'tmiss that it's really tricky identify adevice that's why wait - well I got itnow so these are the kinds of shapesyou've got P Q B is equal to what we sayq D for the same reason for the samereason so when you've got correspondingangles the kind of shape that getsformed have a look at it here if I havea look at that first pair it looks likethis and they're facing down that waycan you see that and these are the twoangles I was interested in if you have alook at these other two kind of lookslike this and these were the two anglesI was interested in can you see thatso this is the kind of shape that we'vegot right if you turn it around it kindof looks like yeah you see that lookslike an F and that's how you can seewhich one's a car spun into each otherokay now corresponding angles they'renot the only interesting ones so this isthis other name that I was eliminatingbefore alternate angles okay now here'shis the angle I'm interested in let'sstart back at hur again okay now I'mtrying to work out what's therelationship between a QR and this cuteID we were talking about that down herewhoa so I've got this angle and I've gotthis angle that's not try to work outthe relationship so there's morerelationships here that I can take a bitmore paths for instance a few lessonsback down I think we were up enough80234 memorywe gave a QR and eqb we gave those twoangles and named they have arelationship to each otherdo you remember what they're calledleast then not adjacent because they'renot next to each other is a phraseactually you know yeah well done did youhear that that's right so have a look atthese two guys right these arevertically opposite now would berevision3 Shirley covered sir Shh let'swrite this downokay go a QR is equal to angle PQ bbecause because they're verticallyopposite anglesokay now by the way see how I'm takingthe time to write all this on the righthand side I know it takes a long timebut this is to be honest kind of theimportant part because all of this it'slike it's all just letters but this isnow why why is there a relationship thisis the power you show that youunderstand what's going on okay so eventhough it takes a long time it's rightthis is the important partbesides equal okay but but but hold on asecond PQ b you say go up here right youtold me like five minutes agoyou told me that that angle is equal toQ ID didn't you what was the reason whythis one and this one yeah these to acorresponding I think in fact I've gotit written there I just forgot to writethe reason okay so if PQ B&Q idea thesame I can just swap them out I can saythiscan you see what I've done rightthis is equal to this angle but I knowthis is angle is equal to this one soI've swapped it out it's a bit moreswapping so what's that look like thatmeans that I could actually get rid ofthis guy up here and I can only beinterested in these two and they'reequalright but they're not corresponding arethey what do you say put it back onlater sure woman okay yesyes that's right so we're sort of takingtwo steps to get there but be carefulwhen you talk about angles you've got aname all three of the points right anglea it's like well at least in thisdiagram it's not a man-girl angle therebut I can't just say hey look youbecause I don't know which angle Q it isright there's four of themso what are we got here and a QR angleQR d they're equal but they're notcorrespond because look at them they'refacing in opposite directions I thinkthis one's going down that way and itwas this way so they're notcorresponding but it's still equal nowsince they're facing opposite directionsthat's why we call alternate angles okayalternate English okay now we're showinga great question just now which was dothese two be alternate angles do theyhave to be on opposite sides of thetransversal and the answer is yes infact that's so it's such a guess that Ithink it's worth writing down underneathwhere you've said alternate angles insome ways that's one of the bigdifferences between corresponding anglesand also the ones see correspondingangles they're all in the same signright there matching on the same side ofthe transversal the alternate ones areon opposite sides of the transversalokay so for instance let me get anothercolor and this will help if you haveanother color too that'll be great forinstance we can see more alternateangles here can't we for instance becute ah let me put a umit'll help joint out because otherwiseit's really hard to talk about what'sgoing on which angle is alternative to agroup a queueah well it's gotta be on the oppositeside a transversal right so not on thisside it's gonna be over this side okayso it looks to me like it's going to beover yeah can you see thatso BGR is alternate to qrc thank you seeand I can say that directly I can sayangle B Q is equal to angle Q ah see whyvery similar to this light herealternate angles on a be parallel to CDvery cool okay so I'm going to start alittle pause for a little while becauseyou've been listening to me for a longtime and it says to a in your textbookstarts talking about these alternateangles there is a third kind that we'regoing to get to by the end of the lessonbut I don't want you to just sit thereand absorb stuff from me for so long soI'm going to stop talking for a littlewhile okay do leave some space for thethird type of angle I'm going to tellyou about right and we'll do somediagrams as well but this is alteredangles now you remember I said lookcorresponding it was they look like an Fyou see that there they arewhat do alternate angles look like ifyou just took the alternate angles wellI think they look like for example lookat this one hereit looked like this look like thatdidn't it yeah and then if I have a lookat the other side Iright and I've got this shape over hereI think that looks like it saidsometimes backwards but that's the kindof shape with me so there's an F there'sa said that that kind of shape isimportant it helps you to recognizewhere the alternate angles are
