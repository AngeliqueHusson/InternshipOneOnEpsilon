today we're going to talk about the mostfamous problem in game theory theprisoner's dilemma you and your partnerin crime are apprehended but you're nottoo worried because the police don'thave much evidence on youa clever cop tries to come up with theway to get you to talk he explains thatof both of you stay silent then each ofyou will serve one year in jailbut he offers you a deal if one of youconfesses then that person gets to gohome free and the person who stayssilentgets four years as punishment however ifboth people confess then each will haveto serve your dues to society and servetwo years in jail each the cop leavesand separates you and your partner soyou're left wondering what to do youthink that the best solution is if youcan trust your partner you should staysilent that way you each get one year injail and that's the best outcome for thegroup but you worry what happens if youstay silent and your partner confessesthen you're going to get four years injail and that doesn't sound too good soyou need to think about this morelogically what you do is you imagineyour decision relative to your partner'sdecision let's say that your partnerconfesses you can either make the choiceof staying silent or you can confess aswell if you stay silent then you'llserve four years in jail if you confesshowever you'll only have to serve twoyears so if your partner confesses it'sin your interest to confess as well whathappens if your partner stays silentwell in that case if you stay silentyou'll serve one year in jail but if youconfess you'll go completely free so ifyour partners stay silent it's also inyour interest to confess you come acrossa startling realization that no matterwhat your partner does it's alwaysbetter for you to confess this is knownas aand strategy and in game theory when youhave a dominant strategy you should playit so you find the cop and you hardlyrun over and explain to him that youconfess the cop explains that you'regoing to serve two years because yourpartner confessed as well how did thathappen well just as you were thinkingabout the problemso was your partner he was wonderingabout his actions relative to yourdecisionhe thought what would happen if youconfess and he had the choices betweenstaying silent and confessing herealized that it was better for him toconfessif you confess now if you stay silenthe again realized that it's in hisinterest to confess so he has a dominantstrategy which is to confess so farwe've been thinking about the game fromone person's perspective at a time buttruly we should be thinking about ittogether as a whole when both people aremaking the decision they each have thechoice to say silent or confess and thataffects the outcome for each person inthe group they can both stay silent oneperson can stay silent while the otherconfesses or they can both confess nowit seems best for the group if theycould both stay silent they'll onlyserve one year in jail and that's thebest that they could do as a whole butas we showed earlier it's better for youto confess no matter what your partnerdoes and is better for your partner toconfess no matter what you do thereforeboth of you will end up confessing tothe crime and serving two years this isthe best individual outcome that you cando if you can't trust your partner andyou have to make the best decision foryourself this situation is known as aNash equilibrium and this is the crux ofthe prisoner's dilemma that this is aworse outcome for everyone so theprisoner's dilemma is a conflict betweenchoosing what's best for youindividually and choosing what's bestfor the group as a whole and these twothings are not equalwhile you would like to do the bestthing for the group you can't trust thatother people will also cooperate and dothe best thing for society so you haveto do what's best for you individuallyand that ends up worse for everyone theprisoner's dilemma comes up time andagain in our daily lives when you askyour friends to volunteer for help whenyou're driving and wondering whether tospeed or when you're trying to save theenvironment and asking others to begreen as well obviously we do win someof these games and we can find the bestoverall outcome for the group this is abrief introduction to game 3 and youhave to learn that there are ways tobuild trust and overcome the prisoner'sdilemma thank you for watching pleasesubscribe I make videos on math and gametheory you can also check me out on myblog mind your decisions I have weeklypuzzles on Monday and game theory pulseon Tuesday and you can check me out onTwitter at fresh tall Walker thanks
