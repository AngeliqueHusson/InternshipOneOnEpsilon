they give us a polygon they want us tofind this missing angle here X now thething to notice is that when you extendthe side of a polygon like this you getan angle on the outside which is calledan exterior angle and if you add up allthose exterior angles around the polygonit's going to add up to 360 degrees andjust remember that at each vertex you'reeither going to extend this side or thisside just one but not both okay soyou're going to get one exterior angleat each vertex there and they all add upto 360 so in this case you can see we'vegot 90 okay because that's a right angleplus 101 degrees plus 60 degrees plus 80degrees plus x equals 360 degrees so ifwe add these up we can solve thisequation so I'm just going to use acalculator here so we've got let's see90 plus 101let's see 90 plus 101 plus 60 plus 80okay which comes out to 331 plus xequals 360 and if we subtract 331 fromboth sides right we get let's see howmuch is that that's 29 so X would equal29 degrees so you can double check mymath but basically you're adding all theangles up on the outside and they'regoing to add up to 360 degrees now thenext example it says what is theexterior angle and a regular octagon nowremember regular means that all theangles are the same and all the sidesare the same length but the form we'regoing to be using here is that again weknow that all the exterior angles add upto 360 degrees so if we divide them bythe number of angles or exterior angleshere that's going to give us the measureof one of the exterior angles okay so inthis case it's an octagon we know in anoctagon there's eight sides or eightangles so 360 divided by eight gives us45 degrees so all those angles on theoutside are gonna be 45 so I'll justdraw a quick octagon that's like a stopsign right and you can see if you'reextending that side there's yourexterior angle 45 and you can see eachone of these is going to have a 45degree exterior angle so I hope thishelped you understand how to work withyou know finding that exterior anglewhen you're working with polygonssubscribe to the channel check out moremath tutoring videos on my youtubechannel Mario's math tutoring and I lookforward to helping you in the futurevideos I'll talk to you soon
