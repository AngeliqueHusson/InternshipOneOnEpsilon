welcome let's launch right into it whatis a vectorwell the vector quite simply is just ashiftmost people don't say this but I'msaying it for example imagine anearthquake hits a town at all points intown move two units east and one unitnorththat means the whole every point in thetown has shifted by this amount so thispoint here is shifted by this red amountthe spot here is by shifting the samething this point here is also shifted bythe same quantity shifted by samequantity every point in town ships thesame amount in the same direction thatis all the vector is a vector isrepresented by an arrow example anywherethese arrows represents the shift whichcase this vector represents the shifttwo to the right and one up and that'sit but no particular vector noparticular arrow is the vector it justrepresents the total shift everywhereevery point moves the same amount ourvectors are usually denoted with theletter V and a textbook they've done onboard font which is very hard to drawnon page and what I do in the page isunderscore it so I might call thisvector V and the notation for this iswell people use to usually use anglebrackets two to the right and one up ifI was to draw a second vector maybe I'lldo it in green I might call it W my myover the vector say R three negativefour what does that mean that meansevery point in town's shifted threeunits to the right and four units downhere's the total shift there's thevector W but I don't mean thatparticular error I mean everywhere intown is being shifted by this amountthat's it that's all a vector is nothingmore than thatmost people say that a vector is aquantity with both magnitude anddirection I can make sense of that totype example if I look at my vector 3negative 4 that is the W I guess themagnitude makes sense it looks likelittle white triangle I can usePythagoras theorem and see that thisvector this arrow here has length 5 somuch say the magnitude of W and I useabsolute value signs usually a doubleset of them is 5 it certainly has adirection I know which way I'm shiftingso in some sense that's that that'sright it has a magnitude and has adirection people might say that windvelocityis a vector because each particle of airis shifting by a certain amount of acertain amount of time all right let mejust go through some very basicoperations and vectors it's notconfusingHighschool tends to make this veryconfusing I don't know why it's so hardwhat does it mean let's just think it'srude to infect in terms of earthquakesto go with the American again to talkabout V plus W that means suppose mytowns hit first hit with a vector V thatas everything shifts to places right onone place up and then later the wholetown is hit by second vector is secondearthquake that means everything movesthree places over and four places downwhat's the tousle is that almost mypicture what's the resultant shift fromthat well I could say after those twoearthquakes every point in town hasmoved this amount I'd say it's effectiveEctor V respect to W now algebraicallythis is very easy to analyze clearly Vmoves everything to nuts right and thenlater w w is everything three unitsright this moves everything five unitsto the right and upwards V moveseverything one unit up W is everythingfour units down there's a net effect ofthree units down so I could say thatalgebraically the sum of two vectors isjust add the components the X componentsand add the Y components andgeometrically the sum of two vectors isjust do one vector followed by anotherwhat happens at the point zero is quiteV followed by earthquake W there'slittle curiosity here um it is veryobvious algebraically that I look at theX components 2 plus 3 is the same as 3plus 2 and 1 plus negative 4 is same asnegative 4 plus 1 so algebraically is asclear as daylight that V plus W shouldbe the same as W plus V that's not asobvious geometrically it's fun to thinkof it so instead of being earthquake Vfirst and W second well if I take thispoint and hit it with earthquake W firstI must move something like this and thenhit it with the earthquake V must movesomething like that well actually yousee I've just made little parallelogramV plus W geometrically is the same placeas W plus V so geometrically vectorscommute under addition and algebraicallythey do so as wellokay here comes the complications andthis is where high school curriculum itgets confusing I'm a mathematician Ilike to make things as simple aspossible even it means doing things thatare naughty and technically bad forexample here's a point a here's a pointB suppose I tell you the corners of aactually to 10 and the corns of beershowing arming heel of 812 I can thinkof these two points as representing ashift what is the shift to go from A toB and most people will denote that as avector from A to B now doesn'tnecessarily mean that particular arrowjust the shift represented by that arrowwell clearly the little do it's thisdifference of x-coordinates 8 minus 2 is6 and followed by this difference ofy-coordinates 12 minus 2 is 12 minus 10is 2 so this is the vector 6 minus 2 butI'm going to be really bad what I'veactually done here is taking the coursethe point B and subtract them accordingto the point a so I'm going to say thevector from A to B is just the point Bminus the point a and now teachers arescreaming at me because it makes nosense to actually add a subtract pointshowever I'm not subtracting points whatI mean by this really bad notation andby being so bad is actually good do whatthis represents component wise this isactually the right thing to do it saystake the components of B and subtractthem from them the components of athat's what I did I took this 8 andsubtracted this to I've got the 6 I tookthis 12 I subtract this is 10 and I gotthe 2 so actually this is validmathematical represent somethingmathematically valid even thoughteachers will tell me you can't subtractpoints don't do that I'm going to do itand the reason I want to do it whoops isI can make so much of mathematicsfor example let's go back to a my pen ifI've got two points a and B and supposeI wish to work out their midpoint pointhalfway between the two well I'm goingto be really badto get to the midpoint start at a and Ihave to add to that shift it halfwayfrom A to B there there's the midpointthe midpoint is given by that formulawhat does this mean okay I'm going to bereally bad for my notation this is thepoint A plus half of if you remember theshift from A to B was given by B minus aand if I simplify this mathematically Iget half a B and I get a minus half of aso I'm basically getting all of a andall of B each divided by two so I claimthe midpoint of two points is given bythis formula Chitradurga - now thismakes no sense in terms of geometry Idon't know what it means to add twopoints together and divide by twohowever what I'm really saying is themathematics behind the scenes componentwise is actually valid and I'm right ifwe look at this let's give some actualnumbers heresuppose a will say 2 7 and B will say ohno 8 5 then this formula says add thecomponents of a and B together divide by2 so I'm going to take 2 and H for the Xcomponents is 10 divided by 2 gives me 5and add the components the Y componentstogether is 7 plus 5 is 12 divided by 2is 6 and that is indeed the validmidpoint and the reason why I love thisis that why stop at midpoints my boardsgetting messy forgive me for thissuppose I wanted the point here that'sone third of the way along well I canfind it here's the one-third point startat a and move one-third along the shiftfrom A to B so that means this is a plusone-third of B minus a so this isactually two-thirds of a minus plus1/3 of B there's the formula for themobile the word is try point to thefirst try point lots of fun to be had infact thinking move actors this way is agrand way of doing us so much geometryactually makes all of geometry much easywhen you come to these sorts of formulasand so forth and if you really areworried about me abusing notation thisway by adding subtracting points I amactually valid in the end becauseanother way to think of points in planesthis is complex numbers and one canactually add and attract complex numberslegitimately so if what I think ofpoints is complex numbers theneverything I'm doing here is absolutelyvalid mathematically even my notationwhich is bad is actually valid now allright that's a little taste what vectorsare suggests you can play with equationsof line this way the place to go to getall this material is volume - I'mactually volume 5 when you get toparametric equations this is a good wayto think in terms of Perish equationswhat's the equation of a line best tothink in terms of
