well let's make a deal was a popularshow back in the day intestines could goon this game show and maybe go home withthe car of their dreams first of all thegame show host was a very famous guynamed Monty Hall and Monty would come onto the show and he would have threedoors kind of contestant that's youwould come on to the show Monty wouldgive you the chance to choose doornumber one door number two or doornumber three now behind one of thosedoors only one was your dream flash carbright red sports car very fast it wasawesome and behind the other two doorswere socks that was so let's make a dealword for something that you don't reallywant so you had looks like a one inthree chance of getting your dream carso suppose you pick door number one andMonty would then do the same thing everyweek he would go over to the two doorsyou didn't pick two and three and hewould open one of them let's suppose heopened door number two and the door thatMonty opened would always have behind itAzzam thank you well he knows everythingright he's the game show host and thenMonty looked at you in the face and saydo you like door number one or do youwant to switch there's only one thing toswitch to in this case it's door numberthree are you gonna stay with yourchoice or are you gonna make that leapto something different and very oftencontestants would stand there agonizedright so they've got some newinformation this switch stick or switchwell a remarkable thing about thisproblem simple as it is is that it'sparked just endless debate in the timeof the showI don't recall anybody ever saying therewas a dedicated strategy that you shouldalways follow but in fact there is adedicated strategy should follow youshould pick door number three that's theanswer you should switch you shouldswitch every time and that will do thebest for you over the long run so thereis a one-third chance that the car isbehind the door you picked initiallythat means there must be a 2/3 chancemuch greater twice as big that the carisor else and since we know that somewhereelse cannot be door number two becausemoney showed us that it's got to be overhere so this is what you should chooseyou should switch twice as likely tohave the car behind the door that youdidn't pick as the door that you did 2/3probability to a one-third probabilitynow if you switch are you guaranteed towin absolutely notbut if you play this game over and overagain on average you will win 2/3 of thetime so switches your strategy and youcan't beat it one thing that you mightsay is that the initial 2/3 chance thatthe car was behind door number two anddoor number 3 got concentrated behindthe door that Monte did not open that'seffectively what's happening that'sintuitively what's happening and that infact is what the mathematics shows ishappening now there is a way to see thatin kind of a more grand way if weimagine not having three doors but weimagine having a hundred doors and let'simagine that we're playing the same kindof game we have Monte over here he isgoing to give you an opportunity to picka door and your dream flash cards behindone of these hundred doors but there are99 Sonic's all behind the other doorsnow what is it that you're going to dowell you're gonna pick a door say againyou pick door number one now you'refeeling a little bit different than youmight have felt in the case where therewere three doors because there youthought wow I've got a one in threechance here you're thinking I've got a100 chance I'm not gonna get that carit's not behind door number one it'sprobably behind one of the other 99doors what Monte does is he opens 98 ofthose 99 doors he shows you 98 zonk'sand he asks you now do you want toswitch well maybe just because of thesheer numbers this thing is a littleclearer you know that there wasninety-nine out of a hundred chance thatthe car was over here and now the onlydoor you're left with after Monte showsyou all those socks is door say numberthreeseven and you're thinking this is nogood this is no good all those doors areno good do I want to stay with one or doI want to stay with 37 you can sort ofalmost feel the concentration of that99% going behind door number 37 and soyou switch over here and very likelyyou're gonna get this car and drive awayI love you car drawing well thank youthat makes more sense doesn't itsuddenly it seems like a no-brainer itdoes seem like a no-brainer but in factwhen it's on a smaller scale maybe justbecause 1/3 and 2/3 are a whole lotcloser to each other than one in ahundred and ninety-nine and 100 that thethe point is is obscured x and y is theprobability of x given that Y happensgiven that you know he opened doornumber two what's the probability of thecars there times the probability of Yhappening by itself
