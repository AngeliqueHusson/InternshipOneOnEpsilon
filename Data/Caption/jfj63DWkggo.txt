hello my name is Maria Miller from mathmom of calm and this is mathie my mascotand assistant in this lesson we're gonnastudy dividing decimals using mentalmath and other symbols we'll have up tothree decimal digits here's an exampleif I have six tenths divided by threeyou can think of sharing equally if youhave six tenths and you are dividingthat equal between three people how muchdoes each person get the answer is verysimple right each person would get twotenthsokay nothing much to that yeah the sameidea works I have 32 hundredths and if Ihave four people sharing them equallyit's like in the picture you've seen 32pcs so I'll do in my mind is 32 dividedby 4 equals 8 each person would get 8pieces and those pieces are hundredthsright so the answer is 8 hundredthswritten like this remember when thereare two decimal digits then you read itas hundreds one decimal digit takes thissituation is a little bit differentbecause it looks like we cannot dividethese two tenths between 10 people butlet's say you know if you had achocolate bar in that shape and youneeded to divide it between 10 peopleyou divide it further into smallerpieces right and we can do the same okayI can basically divide this whole thinginto hundredths just like it is hereright so now my two tenths that thecolored have become 20 hundredths so myproblem changed to 20 hundredths dividedby 10 and now each person would get twohundredths so that's like a little trickthat we can use sometimes basically Itried on an extra decimal zero into thenumber and then my division was even soto speak yeah can you solve these onyour owntry some possiblyyeah I have 21 hundredths divided by 3so I just think 21 divided by 3 equals 7and my answer will be in hundredths so Iwrite 7 hundredths what is it Marty ohyeah right he says that he loves tothink of this trick as you know forexample here 56 blueberry muffinsdivided between 7 people he remembersthe trick butter using blueberry muffinsbut it is actually fifty six thousandthsright three decimal digits thousands somy answer is also in thousands now here8 tenths divided by 10 I will use thetrick of tagging a decimal zero here soit becomes 80 hundreds and then 80divided by 10 is eight and they will behundreds just like the blueberry trickagain this is the blueberry trick again3/10 same thing now I cannot suggest Ineed to write it like this 3.0 and thinkof it in my mind as 30 tennis so thetenths divided by 10 is 3 tenths and bythe way you remember you can check allthis by multiplying this times this hasto equal leaves three tens times ten hasto equal three okay let me test herelooks like almost as if we had 18divided by 6 equals three right but thisis actually one and eight tenths or 18tenths so the answer will be three tenshere I have four tenths divided by fiveit looks like it's not an even divisionor not easy to do mentally but what Ican do is I can use this trick magazineoh now I have 14 hundredths divided byfive eight hundredths right okay yeahI'll do the same target zero here butit's still not yet even another one sonow I have tothousands divided 100 so I get tothousands right one more 4/5 okay wellagain let me think in tents and make itinto forty tenths divided by five manshould be eight tenths
