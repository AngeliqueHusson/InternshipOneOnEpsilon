here I have a triangular slab of cake ifit's an isosceles triangle and I canshow his dimensions it's 10 inches wideon the base so I'm in America I workwith inches and it's exactly 12 incheshigh so the isosceles trying to get apiece of cake 10 but on the base 12 highand what we do it's going to cut it outa piece of this cake and take it away oreat it right away because I like cakeall right we'll do it a funny way I wantto take out a very particular piece ofcake and then cover my tracksso I'm going to measure a particularpiece location of a piece of cake sointro is only come in two inches in fromthe left so two inch mark is there so Icut a vertical or mat I'll just mark avertical line about there that's toomuch two inches in I think we see thatpretty well and I'll do this in the samething from the other side two inches infrom the right is about there I was markthat line there because what a marvelouscake a very special rectangle pit I'lltake the rectangle that's the top ofthose two lines but I think is aboutthere all right because the piece ofcake I want to remove from thistriangular slab is a rectangle right inthe middle now let's say one of thedimensions is rectangle it's uh it lookslike it's five high yep and it lookslike it's six wide okay five higher sixwise I'm going to come in two inchesfrom the top to the bottom tutors on theleft turn just on the side okay heregoes more inches so two inches from thetop gets me about there whoops try to bepretty good turns us from the bottomgets me about very bad inch wide in themiddle I guess two inches from the sidegets me about there and Twitter from theother side gets me about there all rightbit hard to see is the icings aboutgetting in the waybut it's this piece here this littlepiece here should be what two inchesfrom fire to through one inch by twoinches I believe it was six wives yessix wide and five hi Sophie tourism twoinches in makes one inch high George'sin terms of two inches wide so I onlycut out that piece of cakeand I see if this works so I'm doingthis live I've never tried this beforeactually this is my first attemptso there is a lovely little piece ofcake for me to eat right now and enjoyall right there it is take it out put itaside it looks lovely isn't it yesthat's a gooey icing this is gonna be amessy video all right here I guess takeout all the cake I want all my cakeplease I'm gonna make an actual hole inthe middle of this triangular slip greatall right so now I've just stolen apiece of cake from my triangular slab ofcake which is not very good well as itis good because I'm just keep creatingcake this is a good thing I'm doing allright hmm yummy asking alright now I'mgoing to now I'm actually going to nowtake these pieces and cut up the wholecake in fact I will cut off these sidetriangles are marked I'll take it oneside triangle there I'll take up thisside triangle okay oopscarefully icing a little bit I will takeoff the top triangle just move this wayout the way around and I'll slide thatup and in fact I'll even shot that oneand a half this way my handle doesn'tget in the way all rightand then I've got the strange ring shapewhat else I'll do now as I'll chop itthis way I'll make an l-shaped piecethis way and the l-shaped piece this wayso now I've got two l-shaped peers thathave the separates there it is and thereit is now all the crumbs are should havegone with the cake I took away earlierall right well that is a mess but you'llsee what I've done also here actuallylet's stand up there we go that I didactually mark the outline of thetriangle underneath on paper so you cansee this is the original 10-inch whoopsyou're not seeing it you guys here's theoriginal 10 inch by 12 inch triangle soI'm not cheating that really is the 10inch 12 inch silhouette of this piece sowe're do now these two little sidetraumas going to put at the top putthese back at the top they fit therenicelyI'm irate these two rectangles are putjust underneath the side triangles herenice and look that leaves two triangularpieces on the sides oh look at this lookat this I'm so gonna get stay in thelines I'm gonna cheat I want to stay onthe lines it's not in the lines a littlebit over beautiful by rearranging thosesix pieces of cake I've now reassemblethe entire original cake in fact I cancompletely cover my tracks by doing someicing just spread the icing on top andlook at that I can have it back at myoriginal cake with a piece over herelooks like a bit of a mess but there'sthe piece I could eat but now if you dothis again say I now actually have aninfinite supply of cake because what Ican do now is chop up that little middle1x2 rectangle back in chop up the sidetriangles top of the to top triangles tocover the two L shapes take it my middlepiece have a grand time with itrearrange the pieces back again and makeanother solid cake and do it again ifthat I can have an infinite supply ofcake by doing this process over and overagain forever isn't area wonderful isn'tit fabulous it's just rearranged areasyou get a whole new area again brilliantthat is the astounding power of area andthat's what I want to talk about forglobal math week in the futureWow[Music]
