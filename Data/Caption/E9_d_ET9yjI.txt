g'day and welcome to tech math Channelwhat we're going to be having a look atin this video is we're looking at usingtrigonometry we're looking at in thelast video and using the trigonometry tosolve for unknown sides okay work and Iknow inside so first off let's just gogive a quick recap what we had to lookat last video we had a look at first offhad a had a name of different sides of atrigonometric like a right angletriangle and when we use in trigonometrywe have a couple of different names fordifferent sides so we have this anglehere we call that theta we have a longside here which we call the hypotenusewe have the side opposite theta whichwas called the opposite and we had theadjacent side here which was called itJason okay so H oh and I and then we hadthese trigonometric oh the trigonometricfunctions you're going to see here wehave our I'll just put the calculator uphere this is the calculator on yourcomputer by the way if you don't saysthis particular one you wants to see itmore like this but you'd hit view and goto scientific and if you do this younotice that these three buttons here wehave sine cos and tan but a lot ofscientific calculators have these aswell we're going to be using these threetrigonometry so in 2010 and so thefunctions are as follows we had sine cos10 ok sine cos tan and these functionsthese ratios are as follows the way Iremember it was this so I remember thisthis little pneumonic called some oldhags can't always have their old age allright some old hags current always hacktheir old age ok so we have if we so wehave theta with the signs we're going tobe playing around with the opposite andhypotenuse we're going to be using sinealternatively might be having theta andwe might be as near chasing thehypotenuse in that case we use a cosineor if we're using theta and theseopposite adjacent sides we're going touse tan ok so we're going to be usingthese to solve some unknown sides rightnow so first off I'm going to put a listof rules I reckon YouTube that we aregoing to follow when we solve these okfirst off we you know for our particularproblems we label the sides well thenwork out the trigonometric Euler oneshere we're doing and then what we'll dowe'll substitute values in and thensolve our equations so let's do thisright nowso say we had this particular problemhere it's a nice looking problemit's a beautiful problem it looks a lotlike this ok so it's a triangle 2 rightangle triangle with a little right angledo backe in there okand what we have is we have theta herewhich is going to be let's call it 30degrees we know the side here which is 8and I wish to know the opposite sidehere which I'm going to call X okay sohow do we solve this now first off wehave to label our signs okay so thiswhen you do this really follow thesesteps through so it's really importantthat you know how to do each part sofirst off you should be able to labelthe signs we have theta we have the longside which is called the hypotenuse wehave the opposite side of theta or theopposite and we have this adjacent sideso which particular ones are we usingwe're using the opposite of thehypotenuse so you might remember we hadsome so it first often label the sidesand we're now we'll hit the tree Wfunction so some old hags current alwayshack their old agelike they which what are we going to beeasywell as you see we're dealing with theopposite of the hypotenuse so this isthe side here so we're going to be usingsine but so we'll write that out a bitnicer than this now okay let's writethis out properly now so the rule we'regoing to be using is sine equalsopposite over some old hags oppositeover hypotenuse okay so the way that weactually write this now as we write sineand the sign of white sign per you sayit's a sine of 30 degrees so 30 degreesis a thing we're going to be using signwith and it's equal to the oppositewhich is x over the hypotenuse rightnow before we do anything let's get X orby itself so what can we do to do thiswell at the moment this side is dividingby 8 so we just multiply this I'll beable to get rid of so we also have tomultiply this side by 8 okay another wayI change they want to do these just toChuck another random little thing in andit's a really handy thing wouldimmediately get stuck on on these isthis I actually write this equation inhere that 3 equals 6 over 2 or 2 equals6 divided by 3 this means this numberequals this number divided by thisnumber and it's true yet it's also thesame sort of format as is here we'retrying to find out this number up herewhere the X is so what would we do if itwas this 6 here we're trying to find outwe would multiply this and I'm stillgoing to multiply these two numbers okaythat's just a little trick I use ok soit to work at X we're going to multiplysine thirdtimes 8 so let's do this you might havea scientific calculator but I'm going touse this calculator here okay so it's onthe scientific mode so let's do thiswe'll type in 30 we hit decide which is0.5 times 8equals four okay so our answer is xequals fourokay how did you go with that that's anice easy one to start off with okay allright let's let's go through anotherexample yes oh yeah that that's ouranswer let's go through another exampleand no I'm not just going to make it soit's necessarily going to be the nextone's going to be a cause one in thenext one then after we'll be at an one Ithink I'll be too easy okay okay so I'lltry to be fairly random with them okayoh yeah okay yellow the other triangleit's fairly random as well what about wedo this I do this line here and I'm athere's actually a little bit bigger sowe can see what's going on hereokaylet's put some sidelights on this sofirst off the SS is 90 degreeslet's make theta here let's make it 66degrees okayand I'm going to we're going to try andwork out this side X and we know thatthis side here is 15 as its hand alrightthere's a good little rounder one sofirst off let's label the sides here sowe have the long side here it's thehypotenuse that's why we're not going touse a we're going to have the oppositeto our angle here this is the oppositeand we'll the other one which is runningalongside is the adjacent so we'velabeled our sides now we have to workout the treatment of these functions sosome old hags current always hack theirold age which what are we dealing withwe're dealing the one that's not thehypotenuse so it's not this one it's notthis one that's ten okay so let's writethis out nicely now okayso we'll get rid of those and we havehere we go we're going to have tadequals their old I so tan66 degrees equals the opposite which is15over the adjacent which is X okay so I'mgoing to do that similar sort of thingagain where what I did was I wrote youknow because this one there you get X byitself I'm multiplying over here empty Xby itself and I we so what I'm going todo with this is I'm going to rewritethis thing up here so three equals sixdivided by two okay so we won't we'retrying to find the one down here is toovaluableokay this one here so what we were doingto get this two is we go this onedivided by this one okay so this onedivided by this one this one divided bythis from this one divided by this oneokay so x equals this one 15 divided by10 66 degreesokay let's do this calculator clear andwe'll go 15 divided by 66 tan equals sixpoint six seven okay6.67so how'd you go with that one prettygood okay if you don't know hundredpercent sure when you're doing thismaybe what you want to do is you want togo 66tan you might want to put that into thememory so memory plus and then if you go15 divided by memory read equals sixpoint six seven in fact I should berailing that up to six point six eightit's going to be more correct six pointsix eightokayJago with that one once let's do onelast example yeah hopefully to clay okaylook I'm making the cause one y'know I'mgonna do it um well I suspect I will doa cosmic maybe I'll be able to betrickier all making something that's notclose let's have a look it doesn'treally matter does itokay so what about we do one last onehere and we do this here's my triangleand who nice food lofty sort of trianglebig long sort of triangle I mean andit's what he is going to be I'm gonnacall this one herewhat about recall this one 18 degreesI don't know been doing in fact we hadto do let's make it a close one howwould I do thatlet's let's working with it out we'regoing to go current always has a bit ofa reverse engineering isn't it okay sowe asked through one which is going tobe the adjacent which is this onerunning alongside so let's make thatseven and the hypotenuse that's going tobe X right as that there you get themindset of how a teacher works notesinside as little fish so let's gothrough the motions anyway and work thisout we know it's going to be caused onebut let's work it out anyway as usualbecause it's good good method to be intolet's label the sides first so theopposite over here weof the hypotenuse and we have theadjacent and now let's work out thetrigonometry so we know that some oldhags can't always pack their old ageokaywe're dealing with it always happy so weideally because good it all worked outso cause 18 degrees equals always have awhich is sevenover X okay taking a bit of a shortcuttherealrighty okay so let's get X by itselfokay so I'm going to write a similarsort of thing up with three equals sixdivided by two and this time the one wewant is we want the one down here is onedown here which equals this one dividedby this one this one divided by this onethis one divided by this one so x equalsseven divided by cos I'll in degreesequals let's work this out there okay7 divided by 18 because equals sevenpoint three sixall right cool seven point three six anoccasional you can look at and say isthat it that's actually the hypotenusethere that makes sense answer it's alonger sort of length there it's apretty shallow sort of angle so it's notgoing to be huge about longer so that'sa fairly reasonable sort of answer sohow did you go with this pretty goodhopefully anyway in the next video we'regoing to be having look at work hereusing sides to work out our knowinganglesthere's not much we tweak it's actuallyusing a very very similar sort of ourrules hereokay so I hope to see you then bye
