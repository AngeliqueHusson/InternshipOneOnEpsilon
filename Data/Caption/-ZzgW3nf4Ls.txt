what is the highest common factor of twonumbershow is HCF of numbers computed yes it'scommonly referred to as the HCF let'ssay we want to find the HCF of eight andtwelve to know how the HCF is computedwe just need to understand the meaningof these three words highest common andfactor look at the three words highestcommon and factor so let's first findthe factors of each of these numbers doyou remember how to find the factors ofa number yes we try to write it as allpossible products of two positivenumbers we look at eight first oneobvious way is to write it as onemultiplied by eight is eight divisibleby twoyes so we can also write it as two timesfour it's not divisible by three andfour onwards is covered here that's itwe cannot write it in any other way sowe can say that the factors of 8 are 1 24 and 8 just like we found the factorsof 8 why don't you try finding thefactors of 12 to find the factors wewrite 12 as all possible products of 2positive numbers it can be written as 1multiplied by 12 2 x 6 + 3 x 4 so thefactors of 12 are 1 2 3 4 6 and 12 inthe first step we found out the factorsof each of the numbers the next step iscommon we look for common factors foreach of the numbers 1 is a factor commonto both the numbers 2 is also common and4 is common as well 1 2 & 4 are commonfactors to both these numbers and theonly word that remains is highest so welook for the highest common factor amongall the common factors 4 is the highestamong these three numbers hence thehighest common factor of 8 and 12 is 4let's quickly go through what we didfirst we found out the factors of eachof the numbers then we found out thecommon factors to both the numbers andthen we found out the highest commonfactor the highest common factor is alsocommonly known as the greatest commondivisor or the GCD even GCD means thesame thinggreatest is the same as the highest andfactors of a number are also theirdivisors for example 4 is a divisor of 83 is a divisor of 12 that's the conceptof HCF or GCD but is this the best wayto solve for the HCF of two numbers wecover that over the next few sessions
