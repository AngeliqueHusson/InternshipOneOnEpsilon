all right in this video I'm going to doan example of graphing a hyperbola andwhat I'm going to graph is x squaredover 49 minus y squared over 25 equals 1again depending on whether you have theform x squared minus y squared equals 1or y squared minus x squared equals 1it's going to open at a you know adifferent way so we've got x squaredminus y squared so to me this is goingto look like a parabola that opens youknow to the left and the right so I'mgoing to just cover up the one here onthe right because we don't really needit so againthe things kind of the bits ofinformation to me that are needed weneed our a value we need our B value andwe need our C value and from that Ithink we can make a decent little graphso a squared is going to equal 49 so ifwe take the square root we would getpositive and negative 7 but again I'mjust going to keep the the positive 7for my a value our V squared would equal25 well again if we take the square rootI'm going to keep just the positivesolution so I'm going to use B equalspositive 5 we know our relationship wehave C squared equals a squared plus Bsquared again a squared is thedenominator of the x squared term Bsquared is the denominator of the ysquared term so C squared is going to be49 plus 25 so it says C squared is goingto be what does that looks like 74 andokay you know again we could always tryto simplify this a little bit so if wesolve for C I'm going to make that thesquare root of 74 again just keeping thepositive solution I don't know that thesquare root of 74 breaks down that muchit's certainly divisible by two but itlooks like we would get two times 37that would give us 74 well 37 of primenumbers so this really doesn't factortoo much more in fact it doesn't reallyfactor I mean you can always make it 37times 1 but that's not going to help usbreak down the square root anymorejust going to use the C value of squareroot of 74 all right so when I go tograph this we'll come back to that injust a second okay it says my asymptotesoccur at y equals negative B over a andy equals positive B over a so in thiscase our asymptotes are going to be apositive negative B over a so positiveand negative five sevenths X if it had aslope of one it would kind of just kindof go off at a 45 degree angle fivesevenths will be a little bit a littlebit less steep than that so I usuallygraph my asymptotes firstso there's y equals positive five over7x and likewise we would have y equalsso this will be y equals negative fiveover 7x it says my asset or she's my myvertices occur at positive a zero and atnegative a 0 so my vertices are going tooccur at seven comma zero and also atthe point so this will be negative sevencomma zero and really at this point tome you've almost got everything you needto do a decent little graph when i graphthis basically my hyperbola is justgoing to get closer and closer to theasymptote same thing as you go downlikewise as we go to the right it shouldbe getting closer to that asymptote fromabove and it will get closer to thatasymptote that's below it so let's seeone other thing we could always evenstick ourour faux sigh and they're so we said ourC value is the square root of 74 so oneof the foci would be a positive squareroot of 74 comma zero and then the otherFOSE I would be sitting there at thepoint negative square root of 74 commazero again your graph doesn't go throughthose folks I so I'm just sticking alittle X layer just to indicate wherethey are your hyperbola doesn't gothrough those points but again those arekind of useful bits of informationfighting the foe side so all right atthis point to me I think we've got adecent little graph and I would call ita day
