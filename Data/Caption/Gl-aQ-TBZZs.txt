what are some other ways I can change ashape but it still stays the same MorganOh rotation okay now I'm gonna make thatthis Lawson on view if yours is adifferent one I'll come to an exitthat's okay right so rotation I'm gonnastick that down here rotation right soagain coming back to my rectangle rightthat's right here I'll come back to youridea okay the idea is it's somethinglike this isn't it okayso can someone give me a synonym forrotation turn turns a goodbyecan someone give me another one ohyou'll see why yep twist twistyep spin okayso there you go these are words todescribe the same idea now I want you tohave a think don't shout it out thinkabout this time without translation inorder to know to say you know give someinstruction say I want you ordered youthe same translation you need to knowshouldn't directions any just somedistances right unless you're like Idon't know if it's moving somewhere andI don't know where now rotation is thesame it needs some ingredients but whatare they yeah let's see all your thingswith the trade you turn on translationokay all right sir and angled right sothere's the first piece good somethingelse yeah Jesse okay so degrees thatwould be something that would be thesame as the so maybe 45 degrees or 90 or360 or something like that so that wouldcome on in the angle is there anotherpiece of information I need yeah huhokay I suppose we could put that in herebecause umyeah we would not say that it's aspinning direction is it yeah that'srightI suppose rather vital that you'd sayclockwise or anti-clockwise rightbecause I'm 45 degrees one way is notthe same sports like this yeah okay butthere's still something else let me showyou what I mean okay suppose I told youto rotate this okay and we said okaymaybe we agreed upon 90 degrees in theclockwise direction nine degrees okaynow if I hold my finger here what taughtmy finger back okay on this corner downhere in the bottom right if I would saynine degrees clockwise where will it goit'll go yeah right let me go back let'sjust draw that in so you can see what'sgoing on yes good questionhold on let's talk about that in asecond right so I'm starting from thiscorner right and when I rotate it whathappens you know with this okay see thatis done right 90 degrees clockwiseoh good right ah but if he wants thatquestion about the corner tick I couldpick another corner goodnight I don'thave to go from that corner for instanceI could go from this top corner rightwhat would happen if I rotated fromtherewould it be the same thing I think itwould look like thisisn't that 90 degrees clockwise yes it'sgoing up here well it's the same shapebut it's it clearly in a different spotisn't it all right so picking the corneror even I didn't even have to pick acorner I don't wanna do itcan I do it like yeah I can do it thereright middle good night and I would getanother shape again I would get this onesomething like thatso what's my point I've done the sameangle and direction all three times Ineed something else yes huhokay I need he's he's the word that weneed right I need a point I need a pointyou see the difference tweedle of thesewas if you stop miss corner or thiscorner on this point in the middle yesyou end up in a completely differentspot right even with the same angledirection okay sir you need to say okaywhere are you rotating and this is animportant phrase you want to get youhave to rotate about a certain pointright so I was retaining about here andthen here and then here and I gotdifferent shapes every time okay anotherlittle off nowhe's on you do to make sure that we alldo the same rotation the point that I'mgoing to pick is going to be here theend of the of the bottom part of theyard okay and then bottom right cornerif you like let's order a ticket thissame 90 degrees aroundI can't clockwise so it should end upokay I think that's what you're gonnaget dedicated you might like to put foryourself that what we've done here isgone this way 90 degrees clockwise okay
