hello my name is Maria Miller from mathmammoth comm in this video I want totalk about long division and how you canteach long division to your studentsfirst of all there are few things thatyou need to know before they can learnthe long division and those I havelisted here are needs multiplicationtables obviously and the next is basicdivision with single digit divisorsbased on multiplication tables and thendivision with a remainder again based onmultiplication tables for example 65divided by 7 equals 9 remainder 2 doneed to be able to know how to do thatand then they are ready to learn longdivision and in a long division I haveone example here the steps that weusually follow are written here first wedivide for example 5 is divided into 8how many time to spy go into 8 that'sthe division part then we multiply 1times 5 equals 5 then we subtract 8minus 5 is 3 and drop down the nextdigit which was 9 yeah and these stepsare repeated over and over until thedivision is done and what can seemdifficult for children is that first ofall has many steps like this but thatwill multiply and subtracting in themiddle of division and these two stepshere multiply subtract have to do withfinding the remainder and these are thesteps that can seem confusing tochildren and now I'm going to show you away how to teach long division inseveral different steps little by littleso children can learn why we're findinga remainder and can learn why holdingworks in step one we will start out thechildren with some easy divisions wherethe division is exact in all placevalues for example here 3 goes evenlyinto 3nine and six so those three hundredsnine tens and six ones and we divide 3goes into 3 one time and of course thismeans now hundreds and then 3 goes into9 tens three times and 3 goes into 6once two times and the answer is 132 andchildren should check it bigmultiplication multiplying one two timesthreeanother example it's here two goes intofour thousand two times two goes intozero hundreds 0 times 2 goes into 8 tens4 times and 2 goes into 2 once this lastexample I have is a little bit differentbecause here we have 5 and then 105doesn't go into 1 evenly but if we thinkof it as 15 pens then 5 goes into 15evenly so we can write down 0 forhundreds and then three things and thenwatch the goals of this step is first ofall to let children become very familiarwith the notation because they might notknow it beforehand where we have thisdivision symbol like this it looks likea corner I call it the division cornerthe number we divide goes inside thecorner and then the divisor goes outsideand the answer golden pot and the secondgoal we have here is to think in termsof how many times does the divisor gointo these numbers instead of thinkingthat 4 divided by 2 is 2 we think howmany times does 2 go into 4 and this isprobably very easy for children and thenwe will go to the second step where wehave a remainderbut the remainder is in the ones so thisthe easiest way to stop for examplethree goes into three hundred one timethree goes into nine tenthsI'm so sorry exactly divisions and then3 goes into 4 one time but notinterlinkedthat's a remainder ok I'm sure you canwrite it right here at first and then wewill continue from this where we willactually find that we made it bymultiplying and subtracting but it is okit will begin for them to just write ithere if they do it mentally safe eitherwe made a mental focus into eighthundreds to kind four goes into zerothere are times 4 goes into 6 one timeand there will be a remainder of 2 okaywe know that but now we will practicethe multiply subtract stick for findingthe remainder so we go 1 times 4 is 4and then subtract 2 and that gives usthe remainder in the ones and similarlyhere 2 goes into 6 3 times 2 goes into 2one time 2 goes into 0 zero times 2 goesinto 5 2 times now 2 times 2 is 4 andsubtract that finds the remainder so thetotal answer here is 3102 remainder 1 inthe next step we have a remainder in thetens and we are just using two-digitnumbers at first in order to keep thedivisions as short as possible here westart up three goes into eight oh eighttens two times but Addisonthat is not an exact division there's aremainder so to find the remainder wenow multiply and subtract to find howmany tens outlets over some times 3 is 6and subtract to find the two pennies areleft over and now the two pens arecombined with a 1 1 by dropping down thedigit this dropping down the digit isactually addition they are adding thetwo tenths and one now we divide 3 into21 or 7 times and that is exactly somepeople stop here and because they knowit was exact and some people continue 7times 3 is 21 and subtract to find thefinalremainder is zero another example sevengoes into nine tens ones but it's notexact so that's what we have to now findthe remainder by multiplying andsubtracting 1 times 7 is 7let's subtract to find the remainder twotens and now we add the eighth to thesetwo tenths by dropping another digit andthen seven goes into 28 four times fourfive seven twenty eight and no remainderafter children master this step thenthey are ready to divide longer numbersthree or four digit numbers but we willhave to of course go through thesemotions many more times and for examplethree goes into seven hundreds here twox + 2 x 3 6 and subtract find theremainder of 100 this 100 is havecombined with the tens is 110 here sothe lidget is drop down and we divideinto 3 3 into 11 oh it's actually 11things 3 goes into 11 3 times and thenagain it's not exact so we find aremainder 3 times 3 is 9 and now we havea remainder of two tenths and that iscombined they go on 108 Chris you are alate appointment to taste famine 3 goesinto 21 seven times so it's again anexact division and similarly we will doit with this as you know as a teacher
