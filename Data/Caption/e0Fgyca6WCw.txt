hi everyone today we're going to talk about
how to find the dimensions of the cylinderthat minimize its surface area to complete
this problem we'll draw a picture of the problemand write what we know identify optimization
and constraint equations and then use thederivative of the optimization equation to
find the dimensions let's take a look in thisparticular optimization problem we've been
told that a cylindrical can must be made tohold one liter of oil and then we've been
asked to find the dimensions of the can thatwill minimize the cost of the metal used to
make it as with any optimization problem thefirst thing you want to do is draw a diagram
of what you've been told and write down asmuch information as you can so we've drawn
a diagram of the cylinder and we've indicatedr as the radius and h as the height of the
cylinder we've also written down that oneliter is equal to a thousand cubic centimeters
and that the area formula for a cylinder istwo pie r h plus two pie r squared we also
know that the volume of a cylinder is pier squared h so really quickly in case you
don't remember those remember that the areaformula is two pie r which is the circumference
of the circle times h the height of the canso that gives you the outside or the material
used to make the side and then pie r squaredis the area of the circle so that will give
you the top and bottom you multiple by twoto account for the top and bottom together
so when we simplify we get two pie r h plustwo pie r squared the formula for the volume
is the area of the circle times the heightof the can so the area of the base times the
height which will give us the total volumeof the can once we've written down all the
information we've been given our next stepis to identify a constraint equation and an
optimization equation so with any optimizationproblem like this you're always going to need
an equation you can optimize but you'll alsoneed a constraint equation because we've been
asked to minimize the cost of the metal thatmeans that we're going to be minimizing the
surface area of the can because the metalis defined by the surface area so minimizing
the surface area means that our optimizationequation will be the area equation so let's
go ahead and say that this area equation herewill be our optimization equation our constraint
equation is the equation that limits us sowe've been told that cylindrical can has to
be made to hold one liter of oil that's theonly constraint we've been given so what the
problem is asking is for us to optimize thearea the surface area minimize the cost of
metal or minimize the cost of the surfacearea within the constraint or within the condition
that the volume has to hold one liter or athousand cubic centimeters so this volume
equation here will be our constraint equationour next step is to figure out how to reduce
our optimization equation to just one variableso because we have in our optimization equation
here both r for the radius and h we need toget rid of one of those the way that we're
going to get rid of one of them is by solvingthe constraint equation for one of the other
and then plugging in to the optimization equationso let's go ahead and solve our constraint
equation our value equation for either r squaredor h in this case let's go ahead and solve
it for h because that will be really easyto plug in to the area equation we just got
h right here so the way that we'll do thatis just by plugging one thousand cubic centimeters
in for volume we know that has to be the volumeand we'll set that equal to pie r squared
h and we'll solve for h obviously to solvefor h we'll just divide both sides by pie
r squared so we'll get one thousand dividedby pie r squared now that we've solved for
h we can go ahead and plug that back intoour area equation so if we say area over here
is equal to two pie r multiplied by h whichwe solved for as one thousand over pie r squared
plus two pie r squared now we have our optimizationequation for surface area in the form of one
variable r and now that we've got it in onevariable all we need to do is simplify take
the derivative set the derivative equal tozero and solve for r and r should give us
the radius of the can that minimizes the surfacearea so let's go ahead and simplify this first
we'll see that we get pie to cancel here andwe'll get r to cancel from the numerator and
the squared to cancel in the denominator sowe'll be left just two thousand divided by
r plus two pie r squared let's go ahead nowwe need to take the derivative because we've
simplified this as much as possible so let'sgo ahead and make this a little easier on
ourselves we'll call this two thousand r tothe negative one remember we can move a variable
from the denominator to the numerator justby changing the sign in the exponent from
a positive to a negative so two thousand rto the negative one plus two pie r squared
if you're not comfortable doing this you canobviously use quotient rule to figure this
out so we're going to take the derivativea prime and we'll get negative two thousand
r to the negative two plus four pie r andwhen we move this r to the negative two back
to the denominator we'll get negative twothousand and actually let's go ahead and make
that our second term so we don't lead withthe negative we'll get four pie r minus two
thousand over r squared so that is our derivativeequation now we need to set this equal to
zero and solve for r so if we set it equalto zero let's at the same time go ahead and
find a common denominator in order to finda common denominator we're going to be multiplying
this first term by r squared over r squaredand we'll get four pie r cubed we can combine
the fractions minus two thousand all overr squared so now what we can see is that this
right hand side here is going to be equalto zero whenever the numerator is equal to
zero or if the denominator is undefined howeverif the denominator is undefined that means
r is equal to zero and we know r can't beequal to zero because we're talking about
a three dimensional here in real space andif r is equal to zero then the cylinder doesn't
exist so we can almost just discount thatand we're really just looking at where the
numerator is equal to zero so let's go aheadand factor out a four and we'll get four times
pie r cubed minus five hundred obviously nowwe can see that the right hand side will equal
zero only when pie r cubed minus five hundredis equal to zero so we can really just ignore
the four or divide both sides by four andthat will go away and now if we add five hundred
to both sides we'll get five hundred equalspie r cubed if we divide both sides by pie
we'll get r cubed equals five hundred dividedby pie and if we solve for r by taking the
cube root of both sides we'll get r equalsthe cube root of five hundred divided by pie
we know now that this must be the radius thatminimizes the surface area of the can if we
want to find the height as well we can justgo ahead and plug r into our height equation
it's not very clean but we'll get one thousanddivided by pie times and now we have r squared
here so we get the cube root of five hundreddivided by pie all squared that's really just
going to give us one thousand divided by pietimes five hundred over pie to the two thirds
power so these are the dimensions h here andr here that minimize the surface area and
therefore minimize the cost of the metal usedto construct the can so I hope you found that
