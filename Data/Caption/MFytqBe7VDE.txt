welcome I'd like to explain some of thenames in trigonometry when one firstlearns trigonometry once deals with aright triangle and we may be interestedparticular angle X we call the sideopposite angle the opposite side thehypotenuse the longest side of thetriangle or set already has a name thehypotenuse but the other side adjacentto the angle we call the adjacent andstudents are taught to memorize sixratios usually three four sometimes sixfor example taught that sine of X isdefined to be the opposite over thehypotenuse the cosine of X the adjacentover the hypotenuse the tangent of X iscalled the opposite over the adjacentand then let's see that's a three of thesix possible ratios I could dohypotenuse over opposite and that'scalled the cosecant of X very strange Icould do the hypotenuse over theadjacent that's called the secant of Xand I could also do the adjacent overthe opposite oops and that's called thecotangent of X there is a wonderfulhistory to how sine got its name itactually is a mistranslation from fromLatin which is translated from arabicwhich translated from Sanskrit itactually means the harbor a place to puta boat very strange story the agencyvolume five the text for that cosinewell that actually makes senseare the name cosine comes from what thisis angle X and sines defined to beopposite over hypotenuse thecomplementary angle is up here ninetyminus X and it's sine is adjacent overhypotenuse so Jason of other Patil newsis actually the sine of thecomplementary angle hence the namecosine some sense the companion design atangent this is the one I'll explain whywould opposite over Jason typicaltangent because in geometry tangentmeans to just touch a line that justtouches something very strange name andthen these ones secant that meanssomething in geometry to a line thatcuts through a circle ku secant I'mguessing will be a companion to thatline and cotangent I guess is companiontotangent so what I really want to explainin this video why is secant calledsecant and why is tangent cotangent andto do that we really need to go to whattrigonometry really is it's not actuallyabout right triangles it's really abouttrying to figure out the position of astar on a circle it comes from astronomyso way back at the very beginningmankind would say okay what is thisworld in which I liveand then notice that stars would alwaysrise in the east your own great big welllook like circular arcs all the wayaround is a very bad circle and 24 hourslater rise in the east again so thatstill on the west rise in the eaststars will follow this motion and theidea was I could look up at a star at acertain angle I've call this angle X andI'd be very interested okay what's theheight of the star and that became knownas sine of X root angle to tail againlook at chapter 5 that tail is fabulousthe this length here became known ascosine of X well there's one problemwith the story we don't know what radiuscircle the stars are moving along so tomake the mathematics straightforwardlet's work with the simplest race radioradius possible as assumed we're dealingwith the radius 1 in which case I'veactually defined silent cosine adifferent way he assigns the height ofstar on a radius 1 cosines the overnests of the star on a radius 1 but thisreally is the same as opposite of overadjacent for which to go for are the olddefinitions but look at this sine of Xin a right triangle would be theopposite over the hypotenuse I think Isaid something the wrong thing just amoment agothat'd be sine of X over 1 which is sineof X yep opposite of our partners reallyis sine of X adjacent over hypotenusereally is cosine of X so everything'smatching all right but then we havethese other ratios well I'm going tojust add to my picture I have a circleand I know I'm talk about the positionof star on this circle and I'm going todraw a tangent line segment there's agroup tangent line segment in green andlet me just continue this trial or to abigger triangle let me see if I can workout the length or called H of thattangent linewell I actually have some Ultron wasgoing on I have a big green triangleover to the base and green as well whoseheight is H if I divide by its basewhat's the circle of radius one the baseis one and that must be the same ratioas a smaller red triangle it sharesangle X that both 90 degrees by the a aprincipally stronger similar so it mustbe the ratio of the height of thatlittle triangle sine of X over the baseof that little triangle cosine of X sothe height of that tangent line is sineof X of a cosine of X and hence we willcall this quantity tangent of X if youlike sine was opposite over thehypotenuse cosine was adjacent of thepotenuse a little bit of algebra saysthis is really the same indeed there'sour opposite over adjacenthence the name tangent but there'sanother quantity in this picture I drewthis green line here is the hypotenusethe green triangle is cutting throughthe circle that's usually called asecant line let me see if I can work outits length longer do ratios are similartriangles again the hypotenuse of thebig green triangle L compared to thebase of the big green triangle oneshould be the same ratio as thehypotenuse little red triangle which isone over the base of the little redtriangle cosine of X so L turns out tobe 1 over cosine of X and we'll callthis secant of X secant of X there offwe go what is this really it's 1 overadjacent over hypotenuse or one ofrefractions flip the fraction it'sreally the ratio hypotenuse overadjacenthence it seems appropriate to call theratio partners over adjacent secant it'srelated to the secant line in thispicture well then it makes sense then tosay something like hypotenuse overopposite is the companion quantity tosecant let's call that cosecant and theguess the companion to tangent to be theother way around observer Jason willcall that adjacent over oppositecotangent yeah there's a very messyscreen right now basically sine x overcosine of X is the length of the tangentline segment in this picture of a heightof the starand one over cosine X really is thelength of the secant line segment rightherehence the names secant and tangent nowif you look at the video on Squire andkursk wine it'd be very fun to they'llthink about tank and squeak and go forthanks very much
