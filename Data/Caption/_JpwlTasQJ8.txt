how do we bisect angle ABC this anglemeasures something and we just have todivide that measure into two equal partsthat's what bisecting means to bisect anangle the first thing that we need is acompass we keep the compass on thevertex of the angle and set it to anyconvenient width remember this width canbe of any length with this width we needto draw an arc across each leg of theangle an arc across the first and oneacross the second we have twointersections here intersection of thefirst arc with this leg and that of thesecond arc with this leg we keep thecompass on any one of theseintersections let's say we keep it herewith the compass here we have to make anarc anywhere in the interior of theanger anywhere in this region let's makean arc here now we need to be a bitcarefulwe should not change the width of thecompass we need this width to drawanother arc and for the other arc wekeep the compass on the intersection atthe other leg we keep the compass hereand with the width unchanged we draw anarc to intersect the previous arc so nowwe get a point where the two arcsintersect to get the angle bisector allwe need to do is join these two pointsso we draw a straight line from point Bto the intersection of the arcs thesetwo angles will be equal remember thearms of the angle and the angle bisectorare raised they start from a point andgo indefinitely in one direction if wemark a point D here we can say that RayBD is the angle bisector of angle ABCand angle abd will equal angle DBC
