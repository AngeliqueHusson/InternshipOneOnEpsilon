well welcome in this video we're goingto be looking at the secant the cosecantand the cotangent functions now thesemight sound kind of strange they are newbut really it's a pretty simple conceptall of these the secant the cosecant thecotangent are the reciprocals of thecosine sine and tangent functions thehardest part is keeping track of thesecant and the cosecant a lot of peoplewould think that the cosecant is itstarts with cos referring to the cosinebut in reality it's referring to thesine that's the only tricky thing aboutthis so again this secant as you can seefrom this box is going to be representedby SEC and is rep and is going to befollowed by taking the inverse I'm sorrythe reciprocal of the cosine and thecosecant revs:1809rpm limitations foreach of these because there are timeswhere the cosine function is equal tozero and you can't divide by zero sowhen the cosine function is equal tozero the secant is going to be undefinedfor the sine function there are timeswhen the sine of a value is equal tozero and when that happens the cosecantis going to be undefined and same thingwith the cotangent when the sine is ofsomething equals zero the tan thecotangent is going to be undefined welllet's look at an example here the cosineof 60 degrees we know that that's equalto 1/2 so the secant of 60 degrees isgoing to be equal to thereciprocal of the cosine functions willbe equal to cosine one over the cosineof 60 which again we know that thecosine of 60 is 1/2 so it's going to be1 divided by 1/2 we do not leave it likethis we have to simplify it so this isgoing to be the same as we would take 1times the reciprocal of the base or thedenominator that's gonna be 2 over 1which just gives us 2 now for all theseproblems since the numerator is justgoing to be one a fast way to do this isjust to take the reciprocal thedenominator and that's going to be youranswer let's look at some other exampleshere we have the secant - 7 PI over 6now I don't expect you to memorize theunit circle in radians so we can convertthis to degrees when you do that whenyou take 7 times 180 divided by 6 youget 210 degrees this is the same as thesecant of 210 degrees well again we'redealing with the secant so that's goodwe do it the same as one over the cosineof 210 degrees well we know that 210degrees on the unit circle is negativesquare root of 3 over 2 so our answer isgoing to be the reciprocal of thedenominator so our answer is gonna be anegative 2 over the square root of 3 nowthe problem is we cannot leave thissquare root in the denominator so youmultiply the numerator denominator bythe square root of 3 and when you dothat we get negative 2 square root of 3in the numerator and square root of 3times square root of 3 is just 3 in thedenominator and that would be our answerlet's try another one so the cosecant of135 degrees this time we're dealing withthe cosecant so that's going to be thesame as 1 over the sine of 135 degrees135 degrees that's going to be thesquare root of 2 over 2 will be the sameas 1 over the square root of 2 over 2 soagain what we're going to do at thispoint is we're going to take thereciprocal of the denominator soanswer is going to be two over thesquare root of two but we have tosimplify that so to simplify this we'regonna take multiply the numeratordenominator by square root of two nowwhen we do that we get to square root oftwo over twobut the two is canceled out leaving uswith just the square root of two andlet's try one more so the cotangentagain is the of pie I remember thecotangent that's the reciprocal of oneover a reciprocal the tangent functionsto be one over the tangent of pi butremember the tangent is found by takingthe sine divided by the cosine so thereciprocal of that would be actually twocosine of over sine so we're going totake right this has a cosine of PI overthe sine of pi and the cosine of pithat's the same as again the cosine of180 over the sine of 180 that you mayhave that memorized and the cosine of180 is negative one the sine of 180 iszero so this one here is not zero thisis one that would be undefined wellthere you have it and that is the secantthe cosecant and the cotangent functionsagain a pretty easy simple concept sohopefully now you understand how to usethese you just have to remember that thesecant is the reciprocal of the cosinefunction and the cosecant is reciprocalof the sine function that's thetrickiest thing about this but otherwiseit's pretty simple so with that goodluck on your assignment
