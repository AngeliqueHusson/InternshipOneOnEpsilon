so now to do a problem like this againI'm going to reiterate this so I canmake sure I have everybody on the samepage yes I'm trying to find the heightof a triangle so I first identify this atriangle and then since I'm dealing witharea I have to use the formula you wanttelling for forever triangles okay welllet's go and take a look at and see whatyou just said that makes senseso down that says double 22 and thendividing to find three and see if thatworks let's see if that makes sensewhat I'm going to do is use the formulaand then see if what you just said makessense so I know the Poorman for area ofa triangle which is right over here areaequals one-half base times height writedown the formula anytime you're dealingwith the figure understand what figuredown with and if you're dealing with thearea write down the formulas now let'sfigure out what information do we knowdo we know what the actual area is yeahthis is comments different than whatwe've done before here is 22 equalsone-half do we know it the basis of thistriangle what is the base three threeright and do we know like no that'swe're trying to figure out so now weneed to find an age that means we needto isolate H all right now whatwhen dominant was saying he wasmultiplied by two well yeah you coulddivide by the one half which is sayingthat the same thing as multiplying bytwo so you could multiply by 2 on bothsides that would eliminate that wouldeliminate the fraction you could alsojust multiply these acrosstwo equals to three halves times inchsay that you want to get rid of thefractions Terrell you're missing thisinformation we multiply by thereciprocal which is the exact same thingyou just told me to do right by my 2/3right so two times 22 is going to be 44divide that by three is going to be so44 so that would be 44 be 11 sotherefore we'd have to do 14 and 2/3yourself let me just check it out i 14/3be 14 which would be worsewhat do you do to get thatjust did 44 I did 2 times 22 and dividedby 3000 statement
