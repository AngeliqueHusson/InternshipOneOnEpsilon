ROGER BOWLEY: I'm going to be
talking about logarithms,logarithms to the base 10.So for example, if I have a
number, which is 100, I canthink of that as 10 squared,
or 10 to the power 2.So 2 is the logarithm of this
number, 100, to the base 10.1,000 is 10 to the 3.This is the logarithm, the 3,
and it corresponds to thenumber of 0's there.It is logarithm of
1,000 equals 3.I can do 10 to another number.So for example, 10 to the 1.6232
turns out to be 42.That means that if I were to
take 10, that means that thelog to the base 10 of
42 is 1.6232 tofour significant figures.The reason it's useful
is multiplication.If I have two numbers and
I want to multiply themtogether, it's easy to make
mistakes, because there are alot of little operations that
have to be added up.If you go through logarithms and
you get a logarithm of anumber, such as 42, and you
multiply it with anothernumber, such as 37, or 59, or
200, you get the logarithm ofthat number, and you add
these numbers together.Let me show you an example.37 times 59.Now, I can write 37 as 10 to the
1.5682, and multiply thatby this number, which is
10 to the power 1.7709.And when I multiply these
numbers together, all I haveto do is add this number to that
number to make this into10 to the 3.3391.BRADY HARAN: That's
like a shortcut.ROGER BOWLEY: Yes.Instead of multiplying numbers,
you're adding this tothat to get this exponent,
and that number, itturns out, is 2183.Instead of having to write this
out longhand as 37 times59 and work it all out in gory
detail, which will require 9times 7 and 3 times 9, and then
5 times 7, and working itout, and not making a mistake,
all you have to do isaddition, which is
much easier.And if I were to do division, I
would do subtraction, whichis much easier.Addition and subtraction
are much easier thanmultiplication and division.So this is a great
simplification.It makes your life
much easier.The catch is that you have
to know these numbers.37 is 10 to the power of this.So where did I get that from?Where did I get 59
is this number?Well, the big secret, the thing
that makes it possibleis that I have a table of these
logarithms, and I lookup 37, this is actually 3.7, so
in order to make it 37, Ihave to add a 1 to it,
and it's 1.5682.So that's this number.And then I look up 59.And there's 59.59.0, I go across , its 0.7709,
but this is 5.9, so Ihave to add a 1.So these, I cheated, it's
all in a table.I can look it up.When I was a lad at school, this
is how we learned to domultiplication.I mean, we learned how to do
long multiplication, but weadded these numbers together
to get the answer quickly.And it was the way of doing
it, because there weren'tpocket calculators in my youth,
because I'm so old.This is all we had down mine.So when I've got this number,
I have to go to a differenttable, which is called the
table of antilogs.Now, the 3 in the front of this
means 1,000, so I justhave to look up 0.3391.So I go down the table,
there's 0.33.And then you look across
the top, andthere's a 9, 3391, 2183.And then I look at the
1, which is thisthing, and add that.And you see I get 2183.And if there was a number there,
I'd have to add thatlast one, but it's actually 0.So this is 2183, which
turns out to be theright answer exactly.So you could get four
significant figures by doingthis, which is reasonably
accurate.It's the speed, the
reliability.If these tables are accurate,
you can get the numbers out.BRADY HARAN: Is this just
something that schoolboys andschoolgirls would use, or were
log tables important forprofessionals?ROGER BOWLEY: Oh, yes.Log tables would be used by
professionals who wanted toget accuracy.And they might not be just four
significant figures, theymight be more, depending
on the accuracy of thecalculations that you
need to make.And they made calculations very
reliable, provided thetables were reliable.But the tables, to start with,
weren't very reliable.And that's really a complete
story in itself, which I'dlike to tell you.Well, now you're going to ask
the question, where do thesenumbers come from?How did I make up tables of
antilogarithms and logarithms?And this was done by a man
called John Napier.
