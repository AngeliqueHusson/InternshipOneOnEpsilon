first of all when we look at the graphof sine you probably already learn howto graph this in a previous lesson butthe key thing that we want to payattention to here is that you knowalthough the sine is a function C itpasses the vertical line test theinverse of this graph is not a functionyou can see that it's failing thehorizontal line test meaning that whenyou draw a horizontal line you know it'scrossing the graph at more than onepoint so what mathematicians decided todo to you know get around the fact thatit's not a function is just to restrictthe domain so when you restrict thedomain what we're doing is we're justgonna look at it from here to here sowe're just gonna look at this part ofthe graph okay I'll just make a littlebit darker so you can see it because nowyou can see it passes the vertical linetest this is a function it passes thehorizontal line test okay meaning itdoesn't cross it more than once so theinverse of this graph is a function sonow how do we actually graph the inversewell what you can do when you graph theinverse function is you switch the X andthe y coordinates you're switching theinput in the output so let's look atthree key points here let's look at thispoint here negative PI over 2 commanegative one and what we're gonna dohere is we're just gonna write this outbut what I'm going to do is I'm going toswitch the X and the y coordinates so ifwe do that this is going to be negativeone negative PI over twonow remember pi is 3.14 approximatelydivided by two is about one point fiveseven so this point is really going tobe negative one negative one point fiveseven okay so if we graph this negativePI over two this is like negative onepoint five seven so we're negative a1 isgoing to be right about there okay abouttwo-thirds of the way and then we'regonna go down negative one point fiveseven it's gonna be right about thereokay so you're with me so far now thepoint here where it goes to the originthat of course is zero zero and when youinterchange the X in the Y coordinatesthere it's just the same exact pointokay so we're gonna be right there andthen this other point PI over 2 comma 1let's mark that one down PI over 2 comma1 if we switch the X and the y we get 1comma PI over 2 and again PI over 2remember is about one point five sevenokay so what we're gonna do is we'regonna graph that point so one is goingto be right about here okay this is onepoint five seven so this is aboutthirds of the way okay and then we'regoing to go up 1.5 seven which is rightabout there okay now when we graph thisthe graphs going to look like let's seelike this now one thing you'll noticewhen you graph the inverse function it'sgoing to be a reflection over the line yequals x so it's a line that has a slopeof 1 it's like a 45-degree line and it'sgoing to be a reflection okayover that over that line so that's allyou have to do if you forget how tograph the arc sine or the sine inverseof function go ahead and graph theoriginal graph restrict the domain fromnegative PI over 2 to positive PI over 2and then switch the X and the ycoordinates on these three key pointsand that'll be a quick way to get thegraph so I hope you enjoyed this videosubscribe to the channel check out moremath tutoring videos on my youtubechannel Mario's math tutoring and I lookforward to helping you in the futurevideosI'll talk to you soon
