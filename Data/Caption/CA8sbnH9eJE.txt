get a welcome to the take bath channelwhat we're gonna be having a look at inthis video is gonna be looking at how tosimplify thirds now look I know a coupleof things first off thirds and noteverybody's favorite mathematical topicI've in fact I remember school Iactually really hated doing cents so I'mgonna try and make this as simple aspossible okay because I remember beingactually confusing school with thesethat the expression simplifying alwaysthought it'd beit's a strange expression always littlebit more simple if you I didn't do thissort of thing but here you go now firstoff certain numbers which basically canonly be expressed exactly using a rootpower so it's a the square root of twoif you were to type this into yourcalculator this would be give you ananswer or say one point four one fourand I want to give you a whole string ofdecimals but the thing is these decimalswould never hit a pattern they'd neverbecome recurring they'd just be thisseemingly random the string of decimalsand they never end and so this thing isknown as an irrational number and thisis the reason we use syrtis because thisis the most exact way we can expressthis particular value okay so looking atsimplifying so it's a bigger ones andthis nowthe way that we basically do this isusing the information that we have ofhow to multiply search then when wemultiply thirds we have this rule now onthe throw this particular rule or twoand I'm going to explain it once againso you know how it works okay so if youhaven't seen any earlier videos on howto multiply so that's okay you'll beable to catch up there so the rule formultiplying thirds is as follows wherewe have the square root of an expressiona times the square root of some number Bequals the square root of a times B nowthat's a nice simple sort of the I'llexplain how this works using non certaintimes so so we had the square root of 4and we times this by the square root of9 and square root of 4 is 2 and thesquare root of 9 is 3 but we multiplythese we get 6 right because a squareroot of 4 is 2 and square root of 9 is 3we modify these we had 6 this is equalto what 6 is a square root of 36 in youcan see it's 4 times 9 is 36 said thisis this rule does work here ok sohopefully you're pretty comfortable withthis rule my face so get me get getcomfortable with itand we'll use it to actually simplifythank youthird expressions okay so the first oneswe're gonna do are these doing three ofthem will do say the square root of 28now what we use to do these is we useour numbers that are gonna help us get aperfect square or I'll show you this iswhat what I mean by thisso say that's really worth actually whenyou do this Johnny down a quick list sowe have to squint which is 4 we have 3squared which is 9 we have 4 squaredwhich is 16 we have 5 squared which is25 we have 6 squared which is 36 7squared 49 and so on and so forth we'regonna use these to help us simplify sowe're gonna use this rule and this ideahere to help us simplify theseexpressions and when we when you'regetting asked in maths to try andsimplify this what they're literallyasking you to do is they're trying toget you to get the lowest possible Sergeyou can hear and it might be some numbertimes just lost possible number hereokaynow the way we do this is as far as I'llshow you the steps in doing this sofirst off what we want to do here is weliterally look for some factors of 28especially ones where we have one ofthese numbers here is 4 9 16 roarrrrrrnow here we have our 28 and 28 thenumber 4 goes into it so 4 goes into itand 4/7 - 28 so what we have here is 28is equal to the square root of 4 timesthe square root of 7 because this petitethe rule here says it's a case I hopeyou say good with it so we couldsimplify this further because the squareroot of 4 is 2 and we're going to be xin that by the square root 4 7 now doesthat look simpler at allbut hey look it doesn't look that muchsimpler Tamayo always grant that butthat is what you're being asked therewhen you're being asked to simplifythese ok so hopefully you're pretty goodwith these let's give another one apractice okay so you should be prettygood with these okay that does take abit of the guesswork out once you knowwhat you're doing with these obviouslythere are two say we're gonna get you towork out the square root of 72 and youask the simplify this no just one thingwith thisso you either side okay yeah what othersdo is find some factors of 72 and youmight look down your list here and thinkokay does 4 go into 72 and you'll findout if it does there's no I'm going to72 and you'll find out it does to 16 gointo 72 no 25,000 but 36 times 36 goesin twice 14 or doesn't so we have threedifferent numbers here that actually goin to 72 oh that's a perfect square sowe could have 4/9 or 36 here the onethat you choose is the largest one so 36here okay so this one equals the squareroot ofthirty-six times a square root of twookay because this will give us still thelowest possible sir yeah does that makesense so here we simplify this thesquare root of 36 is 6 and we're gonnabe multiplying that by the square rootof 2 and again that's the most simpleexpression you can get for this so whatabout we keep you what I'll give you onemore example for this okay because thisI remember I'll be honest I went all theway at school yes I think I rememberokay so let's say I go through anotherexample here so say I want you toactually go through and find asimplification if I know the answer acouple more examples a square root ofwhatever do 48 so it's worth goingthrough your list here and you go well 4goes into it what else goes into it heredoes 9 go into it knowing doesn't gointo it does 16 go into it yeah it doesgoes in three times yeah 25,000 36,00049 doesn't so these are our threenumbers here so we're gonna make thisthis is the one we're gonna choose herethe 16 so this is equal to the squareroot of 16 and the number you times what16 to get 48 is 3okaysolet's work this out so the square rootof 16 is this so the square root of 16is 4 and we're gonna put that times thesquare root of 3 and that's oursimplified answer so now hopefullyyou're pretty good with these now I'mgonna just give you a slight variationthat you might get on these I kind of Ijust would think it would be a bit Rubysoft me if I didn't do this ok so youmight also get these sort of thingswhere you actually to use you get askedto actually are say working at this thissimplification to say something likethis 5 square root 12 so what are youdoing this again treat this much thesame at the start and we have to findsome factors at 12 so 4 goes into it and4 is gonna be our our fact that you'reokay so we're gonna have we're gonnahave 4 and 3 here so this is equal to 5times the square root of 4 times thesquare root of 3 ok I probably couldhave written that a little bit niceractually in fact I'm fine okayso five times the square root of fourtimes the square root of three okay soall you've really done is just put thisfind out the fun to you okay so if wewill do this this is equal to five timessquare root of four which is two timesthe square root of three and this we canactually take a bit further so as 5times 2 is 10 and we multiply this onesquare root of three so there's ouranswer so how do you feel with those doyou feel ok with them hopefully you feelreally good with simplifying suitsthey're not that bad okaythey look agree with you they don't everto me and I feel like what kind ofanswer okay this to me feels like aproblem unto itself but this is whatyou're being asked doing that's whenyou're being asked to do this sohopefully that's my little little biteasier anyway thanks for watching we'llsee you next time
