g'day and welcome to the tech mathChannel what are we looking at today'svideo is how to multiply any two typesof numbers with one note so anytime anya three digit by two digit or a 42 bythree digit number and we're going tohave a look at these and look at itdifferent way of doing this I'll belooking at this sort of thing inprevious videos and I'm going to put alink up right now there you go it'sthere on different ways I do this buttoday it's going to be able to do it forone because I mean looking at this usingour boxes and the basically little tablevery easy table to draw up an easy wayof doing this just in case it might be adifferent way you prefer doing it sowithout much further ado let's workout324 times 15 so how do we work this outnow as I've said to do this way I'mgoing to be using these boxes now we'regoing to need a table which is going tobe three boxes by twelve boxes okay sonow draw this here right now so there'smy two by three and the only thing youdraw in these tables are these guys andor lines sloping down to the left it'svery important I think with this alsotry to be as neat as you can otherwiseyou're getting all sorts of troubleswith math when you know you're not beingleaders we probably realizeso 324 times 15 and hey I'm going to dothis is I'm going to go 3 times 1/2times 1/4 times 1/3 times 5 2 times 5and 4 times 5 and I'm going to write theanswers to each of these questions sothe tens go in this part and the unit'sgoing this part so 3 times 1 is 3 2times 1 is 2 1 times 4 is 4 3 times 5 is15 5 times 2 is 10 and 5 times 4 is 20there you go already got the answers nowhow do I get my final answer well Ishould start adding up in this diagonaldirection so let's a little nothing isnothing 4 plus 2 is 6 5 plus 1 plus 2 is8 + 4 + + 3 plus 1 is 4yeah that's the answer that's prettycool right we can do this with biggernumbers I'll put a bigger one up rightnow okay so let's do our 1342 and we'lltimes that by 600 643 okay so we'regoing to need a box how big that's rightthree by four so let's draw that in soin their box which is gonna have to fitthree rows and four columns and thesediagonal lines sloping down once againso alright in our question which is 30and 42 times 643 and I'll start puttingin my answers now one six or six sixthree is at 18 6 4 is a twenty four tosix or twelve okay next next row 1 4 is4 4 3 to 12 4 4 to 16 for 2's at 8 okaynext one one three is three three threesand 9 3 4 to 12 and three to six downstart adding these up diagonally ok wehave a 6 2 plus 8 is 10 carry the 1 10so 1 plus 9 is 10 11 1719 okay carry the1 one plus three is four six seveneleven twelvecarry the 1 1 plus 4 is 5 6 1 plus 4 is5 6 14 16 carry the 1 and 6 plus 1 is 7Plus this one here is a so our answer is860 2906 that's pretty easy right wellit's a really really good method Ireally really like this method as well Itend to use a slightly different one Ithink the bigger numbers actually insome ways prefer this method I thinkit's a nice simple cut-and-dry sort ofone especially for kids that's of thedeal to real your way also getting topractice here times tables but it's agood one also be done by juggling somany numbers necessarily in your head atonce ok hopefully you like that methodand your mark you with it are a bit of ashot we'll see you next time
