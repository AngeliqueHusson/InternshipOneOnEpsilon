okay it's possible we're going to findthis stump right here at some point andgoes from one to infinity and insidehere we have the interest engine of earn- insert engine of M plus 1 we have twothings inside and this and that are thesame kind and they are just off by oneisn't itthe input here is L then appreciate and+1 so you know this is going to be atelescoping situation so we will do theusual style that's right on two internsfirst alright so let's see I'm justgoing to use this formula here becauseit's a world written for us alreadythere's no too much algebra can do soI'm just going to plug in n is equal to1/2 here and here so them indicate thatwhen n is equal to 1 plugging one here Ican want to hear rightfirst current will have the inversetangent of one as a - the inversetangent of 1 plus 1 which is 2 so thisis the first term but n is equal to 1and then we'll be adding this with wellis equal to 2 so right into inclusionhere we will have the inverse tangent of2 minus the inverse tangent of 3 likethat right and let me just put on onemore plus and it's equal to 3 so inversetangent of 3 minus the inverse tangentof 2 plus 1 4 and so on so put on plusda plus that's put on the full armorhere for the end current we will havethe inverse tangent of n minus theinverse tangent of n plus 1 and thenkeeps on going forever right okay so Isee you guys can all see this and nowhere's the best part the cancellationpart this one stays because there is noother interest engine 1 this right herecancels out with this one right awaythis right sharing that cancel eachother right away and you know this isgoing to be concerned with that and thisis what we have right here but somethingin front it's going to cancel this rightso cancel cancelwhat's that being said we all havethat the actual number powers one ofthis net' right and the reason isbecause this and that is just off by oneso you can expect to have just one turnleft the actual number wise thereforethis is going to be the inverse tangentof one all right the actual number wisehowever you must put this down as wellyou have to take this into considerationright so I'll put this down blue - rightthat's a - and we have the inversetangent of n plus one like this this isthe one more part and we have to seewhat will happen as n goes to infinityso we take the limit of this right okayso the first one is just inverse tangentof 1 and we know that we can calculateit right so you have to ask yourselftension applying go will give you 1 thisis just PI over 4 because tangent of PIover 4 give you 1 right all right when ngoes to infinity infinity plus 1 toinfinity inverse tangent of infinity isyou know the horizontal as though thatlimit that PI over 2 this right here isgoing to give us PI over 2 right andthat's a minus so as you can see herewe're dealing with finite values and ofcourse you can just work with this righthere let's go ahead and multiply 2 & 2and you will see that this is 1 pi minus2 pi so up negative PI over the samedenominator negative PI over 4 like thistherefore this right here converges andit converges to negative PI over 4 onceagain image is ready standing here foryou guys this right here it convergesand there it is because we find the polefor the convergence right this convergesto negative PI over 4 it is possible toenter with a negative value because infact this turns figure that the previousterm right so youkeep adding negative values along theway infinitely many times that's theanswer that's ittelescoping sum again
