new job new job yeah senator presidentmath teacher acapella yeah we're overnow today we're gonna be doing inversetrig functions perhaps you've seen itbefore I'm gonna give you a briefreminder and it's gonna be fun I thinkyou'll like this easily stay with it allright when you take sine you take sineof what types of things angles correctput that downyou take sine of angles angles and thatresults in what types of things almostwhen you say sine and decide what abouttheir sides what do you do with thesides yeah like when you say sine equalswhat over what right so these are sidesright opposite and hypotenuse so you'recomparing sides in a ratio put that downit's a ratio of sides you take sine ofangles cosine of angles tangent ofangles and it turns into a ratio ofsides that's great you saw this yesinverse sine of what you think ratios ohthat's right yes we did and now we'regonna cement it in the new constructionproject job creations angles yes okayso inverse sine of a ratio equals anangle or angles okay so that's basicallythe idea so let's actually try one let'sdo leave this up for a second thenyou'll get more and more used to itlet's do the cosine or inverse cosine ofroot three over two all right now let'stalk about what root 3 over 2 is is itan angle or ratio ratio so thisthe question what is the angle whosecosine is root 3 over 2 you may butlet's actually go over here and let'sunderstand it yeah you can use acalculator as well let's understand ithere over here you agree we're searchingfor the angle we don't know the angle inthis case all right where do I put theroot 3 where do I put the 2 3 notopposite and 2 and what is this one okaythis is a 30-60-90 triangle o3o2x2 no X well yeswhat would X be in this case - so here'sthe thing if you ever blank out on30-60-90 triangle you could always solvefor it Y squared plus root 3 squaredequals 2 squared yes yes impossibleall right Y squared plus 3 y squaredplus 3 equals 4y squared squared thankyou yeah y squared oh good my cubesmixels 1 1 Y is 1 so this is yourstandard 30-60-90 triangle okay so ifyou ever blank on 30-60-90 no problemyou can always use Pythagoras derive sohard so hard nowwhat would this angle be 60 well 60 isgoing to be a bigger size right root 3is more than 1 okayroot 3 is more than 1 so this would be60 degrees or if we want to do it inradianslet's do it in radians now because thecosine of 60 is root 3 over 2 degreewe're doing inverse trig of a ratioinverse trig of a ratio equalsoh you're right it should be 30 that'swhat you're skinny yeah thank you somuch for that and you're ahead of me Ithought you're asking about the wholeconcept you ask you about my mistakeyes it's 30 degrees good catch now let'sdo it in radiansremind me zero radiansnegative PI all right now how manydegrees is 360 Oh 360 is two pi rightyes so 360 would be a four evolutionthat's right and then what was this oneresurrectedokay so now I want you to think itthrough 30 degrees 30 degrees yes whatwell I I could just see this problemfour minutes Guinea I know you're gonnalike it you're like okay 30 degrees iswhat fraction of 180 degrees it is a sixsix so do you agree 30 degrees is onesixth of 180 degrees yes therefore whatis one sixth of Pi one six one six PIthat's correct so this we're gonna callPI over six million okay okay mmm-hmmhe's a hundred eighty degrees PI yesyeah do we want a sixth of a hundredeighty to make thirty just / device sdivided by six Bravo okay good that'sgood now if you get that you're gonnahave roll from here let's go inversetangent3 3 over 3 huh all right now let's gohere here's the angle we don't knowopposite over adjacent opposite overadjacent yes yes so now I'll do it thisway root 3 over 3 divide everything byroot 3 now let's see what happens yeahand then does the triangle can becomenow 3 divided by root 3 let's do it 3divided by every 3 when you multiply topand bottom by 3 top becomes weight 3 3good job bottom becomes 3 3 very goodthese go becomes 3 3 yeah so that's 1over root 3 and set up root 3 over 3 I'mgonna write 1 over root 3 sorry for thedelay there 1 over root 3 there it isall right so it's 30 ago so this is 1over root 3 the angle that we'researching for is 30 degrees thank yousunset it's 3 over root 3 not say againso the original problemthank you for let's let's make it veryclear this is root 3 over 3 which isreally the same as 1 over root 3 sothat's why it changed root 3 over 3 to 1over root 3 so we didn't see 30-60-90hiding inside I just started / I did 10negative 52 because you're in Radianmode go back to the room how do you knowwhen to go back - it depends what theproblems asking for what answers alittle problem for radians what we'redoing so the radiant answer would bethis Radian is an angle measure what is30 degrees again it's on your paper whenwe get 100 PI over 2 PI over 6 unlike aformal exam would ittell you whether once they answerbecause answering radians or the samemath for both yes it's the same map it'sjust depends on how you want to expressthe angle you want affects the angle indegrees every 30 okay let's do more solet's talk about the sine of the inversesine of one third okay now one third iswhat an angle or a ratio ratio let's dothe ratio here's the angle we don't knowwhat it is where does the one go where'sthe three go fits sign right sine isopposite over hypotenuse very good sonow that's the part of our triangle sothis here is the angle whose sine is onethird right here yes so now we want totake sine of this angle uh-huh what isthe sine of this angleit's what's the sine of the AI you don'tneed it check it out inverse sine of onethird is the angle whose sine is onethird there it is so now we want thesine I'll bring down sine it's not sineof one third it's sine of the same whatdoes that is what's the sine of thisangle if you recall when you take sineof angles leads in what types of thingsvery good which is one over what oneover three yeah I didn't you know thatalready then so the line of a negative 13 is 1/3 sine of the inverse sine of onethird is what there's one-third wouldn'tthat didn't oh this inverse sine ofnegative one-third so this is calledinverse sine inverse sine of one thirdis an angle I don't know what that angleis now we can get that angle are you indegree modeyes I get different degree mode doinverse sine of 1/3 please you're inRadian mode go back to the Reese what doI doOh inverse sign up 1/3 yeah how manydegrees is that nineteen point fourseven nineteen point five so this angleis nineteen point five degrees okay sothe inverse sine of one third is theangle nineteen point five now it'sasking what's the sine of this angle inother words it's just one do sign aninverse sine cancel each other yesthey're inverse functions Beijing so 80because this is the negative one yessure sign of inverse sine is cancelledall right good now let's do leave it uplet's do cotangent of inverse sine ofone third all right now we're gettingsomewherethe cotangent of inverse sine of onethird now inverse sine of one third isthis angle happens to be nineteen pointfive degrees we don't care that it'sninety more batteries okay but we justwant the cotangent of this angle overhere and we say what's the cotangent ofthis angle again sine inverse sine ofone third result in this angle gotangent it's one over nineteen pointnine two more five is the angle measurewhat's the cotangent of the angle it'sgood you're you're really you're gettingcloser to paid right and when you getthere you're gonna get not it's notbecause it's a ratio of sidesoh please define cotangent again that'sso good so I'll leave it up I've saidthat before I'm going I believe that'stangent do you agree that cotangent thereciprocal of times I yeah adjacent overopposite what's the adjacent side no wedon't know can we get it yes music Iknow what you mean let's do it usingPythagorean theorem before we do it justa shirt just be sure this is sayingcotangent of inverse sine of 130 inversesine of one third is this angle nineteenpoint five it doesn't matter that it'snineteen point five it's just basicallythis angle has a sign that's one-thirdis it true that the sine of this angleis one-third Sothis is the sine of thesame with number yes so the sine of thisangle is one-third so this angle has asign that's 1/3 whatever the angle isnow though we want cotangent of theangle and if you want cotangent of anangle when you do cotangent yourcotangent of angles and that results inwhat thinks ratios so now we're about toget the ratio of cotangent of this anglelet's do it one squared plus B squaredequals 3 squared 1 plus B squared equals9 B squared equals 2.8 simplify bysquare rooting both sides likes to pointnose not simplify root eight is twopoint eight to simplify it so squareroot of eight has is eight a perfectsquare no know what's inside that is aperfect square for 4 times 2 square rootof 4 is 2 root 2 2 root 2 now tangent isopposite over adjacent so cotangentwould be reciprocal 8 adjacent overopposite no it's what over what yeahyeah turu turu turu 2 over 1 mm-hmmadjacent over opposite oh yes thank youfor focusing I see that was on your face2 root 2 over 1 don't need to write itthere it isthey're going to get better they'regoing to get better all right keep thisyou're gonna see the patterns start toemerge
