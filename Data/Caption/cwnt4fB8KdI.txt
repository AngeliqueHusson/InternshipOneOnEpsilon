so this video is talking about thevolume of a sphere and you can see thatI don't actually have a sphere here Ihave a half a sphere or otherwise knownas a hemisphere yes so I'm going totackle this in similar fashion that wedid the pyramids and conesI want to think about into the thirdgrade level I'm not noticing I'm notmaking a rigorous proof of this we arejust kind of doing a demonstration we'llleave the proof for later okay so whatkind of object would I need to comparethis with this is a curved surface soit'd be nice to keep a curved surface somaybe I should have my coneyes it's curved surface it's got acircuit if it's got the same base and Iknow what the volume this may be I can Idon't know but that's that's gonna behard that's gonna be a little difficultmaybe well I can use the shape that Iuse with the cone I use a cylinder nowoh it's nice at the base of the matchand they do match now how tall should Imake it so if we once try to eliminateas many variables as we can we canchoose the our height so we're gonnamake it a height that is convenient forus we're gonna make it a height that isthe same oops excuse me as the diametersee that so alright so what do you thinkmore greater than the cone same lessthan I know let's go see so we'll do itthe same like we will take ourhemisphereonce of course more than once of courserighttwice more than twice this time oh ithas to be PI that's right becauseeverything where the circle is PI rightso it's gonna be this is this is notgonna be enough right let's see and I'mnot totally sure if you can see that butit just goes exactly to the line I putMcGann live right there I'm just soclose from spewing out the top so yesindeed it isthree of the hemispheres is one cylinderwe have hemispheres if we take three ofthose we're gonna get one cylinder rightnow the good thing is we know that thisradius here is equal to this radius andhow big was the height well the diameterof this was going to be equal to thediameter of this so that died oh thatmeans that it's 2 times the radius rightall right and the volume of this isnothing more than put another equalshere base times the height right sothat's area the base PI R squared timesthe height and how big is the heightit's 2 orso that means this is PI 1 to R cubedright and but that is three hemispheresright so if we want the volume of onehemisphere that would be oh it was threetimes I'll right give my odds werecorrectly three times the volume of onehemisphere is equal to two PI R cubetherefore the volume of one hemisphereis equal to two PI R cubed divided bythreethat's one hemisphere and if we want tofind the whole sphere that's twohemispheres we just double that so thevolume of a sphere is equal to doublethat or 4/3 pi or cute so those are yourtwo important ones for today of courseif you know whether the sphere iscutting it in half gives you thehemisphere and if you know withhemisphere is then you know what it'sPierce fantastic oh here you gonot a problem today right I give youfour pieces one with a hymn excuse me asphere with a radius of five centimetersto a hemisphere with a radius of two anda quarter inches be carefulthree a sphere with eight-and-a-halfinches as a radius and four hemispherewith a diameter of eighteen inches Iwant exact and round it for both okay somake sure you give me exact answer andthen round it to the nearest hundredthsimple and easy right all rightsee you tomorrow
