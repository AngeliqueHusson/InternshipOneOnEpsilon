one really neat application ofdetermines is that they can be used tofind the area of a parallelogram nowsuppose I create a parallel ground usingthese four points a B C and D I've gotthe parallelogram graphed here and itturns out that if you pick any vertex ofthe parallelogram I want to pick a andlook at the vectors a B and a D that youcan use those vectors to form adeterminant whose value is going to bethe area now a B vector a B goes frompoint A to point B and so its componentsare going to be 9 minus 1 which is 8negative 4 minus negative 2 negative 4plus 2 negative 2 and AD goes from pointA to point D and so its components aregoing to be going to be 0 minus 1 thenegative 1 and 3 minus negative 2 5 sothe way we we do this is we form adeterminant using these these vectors asthe rows of the matrix so thedeterminant is 8 negative 2 and negative1 5 now I have to do one other thingremember when you when you switch rowsof a determinant you change the sign ofthe determinant so it's possible to geta negative answer from this determinantso you should always take the absolutevalue now I'm going to write it that waybecause I wrote the absolute value withvertical lines it would be a littleconfusing with our notation for thedeterminant but again you know you canenter these these vectors in eitherorder as long as you take the absolutevalue afterwards ok so let's calculatethis area so that's absolute value of 8times 5 40 minus negative 2 timesnegative 1/2 so let's the absolute valueof 38 which is 38 and so the area ofthis parallelogram is 38 so justremember that the procedure is you picka vertex on the parallelogramthen you have that vertex will share twovectors in this case a B and a D if youuse those the components of thosevectors to form a determinant calculatethat determinant and then take itsabsolute value if we had reversed theorder of these vectors we would havegotten negative 38 we would have neededthat absolute value to get us an areawhich has to be positive so make sureyou remember the absolute value but it'sthe absolute value of the determinant ofthose vectors
