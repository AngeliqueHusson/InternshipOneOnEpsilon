hi this is pressure Locker and today I'mgoing to explain the rule of 72 which isa formula for how fast your investmentwill double the formula is that 72divided by the rate of return is thetime for your investment to double wecan go through some examples let's sayyour rate of return is 3% and you wantto know how long it takes to double therule of 72 says if you take 72 dividedby 3 the answer is 24 so investing at 3%will take about 24 years to double ifyou have a rate of return of 4% we cantake 72 divided by 4 and that gives us18 yearsother examples are with the rate ofreturn of 6% it'll take you 12 yearswith 8% it'll take you nine years andwith 12% it'll take you 6 years for yourinvestment to double while the rule of72 is very popular there's importantimportant things to remember first ofall it's an approximate formula andalthough it's accurateit is still an approximation it's onlygoing to work for returns between about4% and 18% and most importantly the ruleof 72 will not work if you keepinvesting every month or every year andit also requires a constant return everyyear so if you have a return of 10% oneyear 5% another year you know negative3% another year the rule of 72 is not agood guide it has to work with theconstant return so it annoys me to noend the rule of 72 is always mentionedby investment advisers and fineenchiladas analyst and it's simply notsuitable for investing in the stockmarket so my bit of advice is if youever meet with someone who tries tomanage your money and they tell youabout the rule of 72 just walk outbecause it does not work the stockmarket has unpredictable returns thatchange every year so why does the ruleof 72 even work it has to do with theformula for compound interest if youinvest P dollars at a rate of annualrate of return of are 40 years theamount of money you'll end up with is Ptimes 1 plus R to the T what we want todo is we want to say how long will ittake for the money to double so we nowhave an equation that says if you investP we want to solve for the time T thatyou'll end up with to P so the firstthing we'll do is we'll cancel out thepeas from here we'll take the naturallog of both sides and we're almost donewe have a linear equation in T and we'realmost at the rule 72 so we'll need acouple of approximations first of allthe natural log of 2 is about 70% and wewill round that to 72 percent because 72has a lot more divisors the other trickis that the natural log of 1 plus R isapproximately equal to R when R isbetween 4 and 18% so if R is 5% thenatural log of 1 plus 5% is about 5%so using these approximations we havethe T times R is 72 and that means thetime to double is equal to 72 divided bythe rate of return and that's thederivation for the rule of 72 I hope youenjoyed this video please subscribe tomy channel you can catch me on my blogbind your decisionsor on Twitter at pressure Locker
