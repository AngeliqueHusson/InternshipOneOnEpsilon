the 30-60-90 triangle is one of thespecial triangles you will surely comeacross in your exams as the namesuggests one angle measures 30 degrees160 and the remaining one obviously 90degrees so what's special about it in 3060 90 triangles if we are given thelength of one side we can easily findthe length of the other two sides soknowing one sides length gives us thelength of all the sides before you planto memorize the relation between thesides I urge you not to all you need isto understand something very simple theside opposite the smaller angle in atriangle is always smaller so BC whichis the side opposite the 30 degrees willbe smaller than a B which is the sideopposite 60 degrees and this will besmaller than AC which is the sideopposite the 90 degrees angle this isthe most basic thing we need tounderstand the next concept is quiteremarkable these three sides will alwaysbe in the ratio one is 2 root 3 is 2 2in terms of variables if we say that BCis a then a B will be a root 3 and ACwill be 2a let's take a couple ofexamples let's say we are given that BCis equal to 2 units then based on thisratio a B will be 2 root 3 then AC willbe twice this value which is 4 units okhere's another onewhat if we are given the length of a Bas 5 root 3 units BC will be 5 units andAC will be twice of 5 which is 10 unitswhat if a B is equal to 2 units this isinteresting if a B is 2 then BC has tobe 2 by root 3 units look at it this waythis times root 3 should give you a B so2 by root 3 times root 3is to AC will be just twice of BC whichequals 4 by root 3 but what if we forgetthis ratio can be quickly derive it forthat you just need to understand theequilateral triangle well let's draw onequickly and name it ABC all we need isto draw a perpendicular from a on to BCand call it ad as all angles of anequilateral triangle are equal this onewill measure 60 degrees these two willalso measure 60 degrees for now justlook at triangle ADC as the sum ofangles of this triangle will also be 180degrees we get this equation this angleplus 60 degrees plus 90 is 180 degreessolving this we get the measure of angleDAC as 30 degrees so ADC is actually a30-60-90 triangle if the site of theequilateral triangle is s units then wenote that DC will be s by 2 units in anequilateral triangle the perpendicularfrom a vertex to the opposite sidedivides it into two equal parts now inthis triangle if we are able to find adin terms of s we can easily derive aratio using the Pythagoras theorem intriangle ADCwe get this equation solving for ad weget its value as root 3 by 2 times s nowin this 30-60-90 triangle we have allsides in terms of s we are interested inDC is to ad is to AC side opposite 30side opposite 60 and side opposite 90 DCis s by 2 ad is root 3 s by 2 and AC iss multiplying throughout by 2 we get sis 2 s root 3 is 2 2 s there you gothat's ourone is 2 root 3 is 2 2 so if we forgetthe ratio all we need is to draw anequilateral triangle drop aperpendicular and solve for the sides ofthis triangle
