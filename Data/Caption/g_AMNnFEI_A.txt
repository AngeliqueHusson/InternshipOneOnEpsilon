in this video I'm going to work out twoexamples of simplifying radicalsstraightforward simplifying radicals Iam assuming that you've had somebackground with this you've been doingsome of these problems and you just needto see some more examples the directionsare going to say simplify eachexpression and we are going to assumethat the value of each variable ispositive that way we do not have to usethe absolute value bars all right so forthis first example I've got 27 a B tothe third raised to the 1/3 power timesthe cube root of 5/8 the fourth B sincethis is a cube root and this is raisedto the 1/3 power and I think I'm goingto choose to rewrite this in radicalform as a cube root so I would have thecube root of 27 a B to the third I'm notgonna do anything to the second term I'mjust gonna leave it now under normalcircumstances I would probably just goahead and multiply everything out andhave a great big cube root that I wouldthen simplify however taking a look atthese two numbers the cube root of 27 isa perfect cube so I don't want tomultiply those together because then Iwould have to have to turn around andundo that to have a perfect cube root myace when multiplying like bases I canadd those exponents neither one of themis a perfect cube so that is what I'mgoing to do to those and then on thebees here again my B to the thirdalright is a perfect cube root so I donot want to choose to multiply thosetogether because then I just have toseparate it again but I am going to dosome rearranging of terms here so I'mgoing to do cube root of my 27 all rightand then I'm gonna I'm gonna totallyrearrange here times my cube root of 5just so I've got all my numbers togetherall my variables matching variablestogether alright now for my ace sinceneither one of those are cube root thatI'm gonna go ahead and when multiplyinglike bases add the exponents and keep itin mind there is the whole imaginary oneright there so that would give me thecube root of a to the fifthand then because B to the third is aperfect cube I'm going to leave thosetwo separated so cube root of B to thethird and then cube root of a B allright now as I go through and do my nextline I know this is a perfect cube allright it's a perfect cube of three allright this is not a perfect cube so I'mgonna leave it alone it's gonna remainunder the radical all right now for myfive eight to the fifth power here I'vegot to see if I can come up with aperfect cube all right I have five A'sthere I know I if I had at least threejust like this one if I had a to thethird I would have a perfect cube thatwould have two A's left over so I'mgonna break this one up into the cuberoot of eight to the third times thecube root of a squared all right sothose two come from my a to the fifthall right um this term right here is aperfect cube so I can go ahead and takethe cube root of that and give myself aB and I cannot simplify this at all soit's gonna stay as a cube or to be okaynow simplifying one more time this is aperfect cube so I know this goes to an aall right everything else is alreadybeen simplified the best that it can beso now I am done and I can put togethereverything that I have taken a cube rootof and pulled out everything that'sunderneath the Q Bert's got stayunderneath the cube root so that lookslike I'm gonna have an three and an Aand a B on the outside underneath mycube root I will have a five and also ana squared and a B all right and keep itin mind there that you know we're alwaysonly using positive values for myvariables there all right so for thesecond exampleit's a quotient and I have a square rooton the bottom and something raised tothe one-half power on the top so againjust like I did on this one I think I'mgonna take this andturn it into radical form so I'll keepthe 8 on top make that the square rootof 54 X to the 5th and then a 4 squareroot of 3 X to the 3rdok now looking at this neither one ofthese are perfect square roots so Ithink it's going to be to our advantageas to write this as one great bigradical and then do some simplifyingunderneath that of the 8 and the 4 outin front since they're just kind of likecoefficients of those radicals I can goahead and simplify those out in front sothen I would have a to writing that as abig radical I would have 54 X to thefifth over a 3x to the third alright andnow we can simplify underneath thatradical 54 divided by 3 is going to giveme an 18 and then when dividing likebases I subtract the exponents there soI would be down to a 2 square root of an18x squared now you're back tosimplifying just a plain radical hereI'm going to try to break each of theseup into an a perfect square root xsquared is a perfect square root so Idon't have to worry about doing anythingthat but this I need to pick the biggestperfect square root that goes into 18which is gonna be a 9 so the 2 is goingto stay thereI'm gonna break that up into the squareroot of 9 times the square root of 2 allright now I'm gonna go ahead and writeit that way so we can see its squareroot of x squared separated downalright the square root of 9 I can takeas 3 the square root of x squared I cantake as an X all right square root of 2and the 2 which is already outside isdone all right so 2 times 3 times the Xon the outside is gonna give me a 6x andthen the only thing left under theradical there would be the square rootof 2 and again leaving assuming that allthose variables are positive we do nothave to mess with any absolute valuebars all right so just a couple examplesof simplifying radicals and I did assumethat you had a background and hadalready done that before and just neededto seetechniques with some more examplesdefinitely thanks for watching and besure and give me a thumbs up subscribeto
