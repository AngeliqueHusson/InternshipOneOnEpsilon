let us consider the first 10 naturalnumbers in this video we will try tofind the union of two events using aformula we consider the same two eventswe considered for intersection event ais picking an even number and event B ispicking a number greater than 5 we haveto pick just one of these 10 numbers andthen see as to which event is satisfiedwhat will probability of a union B equalit basically means either a occurs or Boccurs or both occur together theformula says it equals probability ofevent a happening plus probability ofevent B happening minus the probabilityof events a and B happening together weknow what probability of a is we alsoknow what probability of B is but whydid we subtract this actually we aresubtracting P of a intersection B let uswrite events a and B first event a ispicking an even number it would include2 4 6 8 and 10 an event B is picking anumber greater than 5 it would equal 6 78 9 and 10 listen to the next part verycarefully when we add probabilities ofevents a and B we add the carbon numberstwice so in this case when we addprobabilities we are adding 6 8 and 10twice since we can consider a numberjust once the common part is what wesubtract once which is why we aresubtracting P of a intersection B let'ssolve this to understand betterprobability of a happening is 5 by 10 5even numbers out of 10 numbers andprobability of event B happening is also5 by 10 5 numbers greater than 5 out of10 numbers we now have to subtract thispart from our answerand as weearlier probability of a intersection Bis three by ten let me repeat we aresubtracting this since we have countedthe common numbers twice in this part weneed the common numbers of a union B butwe need them just once and not twicethis equals 7 by 10 which equals 0.7 or70% here's a good way to analyze thisevent a has 5 numbers 2 4 6 8 and 10event B has 5 numbers 2 6 7 8 9 and 10you can see 6 8 and 10 occur twice sincewe need them just once we remove 3numbers 6 8 and 10 from this set and nowwe are left with 7 numbers so the actualnumbers in a union B will equal 2 4 6 78 9 and 10 these seven numbers form aunion B these numbers will either beeven or greater than 5 or both even andgreater than 5 putting it simply eachnumber should be a part of at least oneof the events these are 7 numbers out ofa possible 10 so probability of a unionB equals probability of a plusprobability of B minus probability of aintersection B here's an interestingquestion do you think there could be achance that we may not need to subtractthis let's think a bit yes when a and Bare mutually exclusive they cannot occurtogether so P of a intersection B wouldequal 0 and the formula would be P of aunion B equals P of a plus P of Bremember only if a and B are mutuallyexclusiveyou
