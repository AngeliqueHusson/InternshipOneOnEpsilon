but our equivalent sets to understandconsider these four random sets itconsists of 1 2 & 3 B consists of 3 4 5& 1 C consists of 3 9 2 & 8 & D consistsof 2 3 & 4 any two sets are equivalentif they have the same cardinal numberthe cardinal number of a set is thenumber of elements present in that setto know which of these sets areequivalent let's find the cardinalnumbers of each of the sets the set ahas 3 elements so n of a is 3 set B has4 elements which tells us that n of B is4 and similarly n of C is 4 and n of Dis 3 these are the cardinal numbers ofeach of the sets we can see that thesetwo cardinal numbers are equal so we cansay that set a is equivalent to set Dand since the cardinal numbers of thesetwo sets are equal we can say that set Bis equivalent to set C remember they areequivalent not equal that brings us tothe question when are they equal we willsee that in the next video for now justremember that if the number of elementsin two sets are equal they are calledequivalent sets
