all right in this video I'm gonna grapha basic rational function and the ideais the graph of 1 over X is the graphhere in the red and it's got ahorizontal asymptote of y equals 0 orequivalently the y-axis excuse me thex-axis it has a vertical asymptote of xequals 0 which is the y-axis ok and thenit's kind of sandwiched in you know thebottom left corner in the upper rightcorner so I'm gonna use some of our sortof reflections and shifting to help usget some new grass here so suppose wewant to graph a negative 1 over X plus 3well the negative 1 over X all that doesis remember it's just going to take ourgraph and reflect it about the x-axis sothe part that had been in the top rightwill now be in the in the bottom rightand then the part that had been in thebottom left will now go up in the topleft so this would be my graph of f of Xequals negative 1 over X again thehorizontal asymptote is still at thesame place and the vertical asymptote isstill at the same place remember if weadd 3 to a function though all that doesis it just I always just imagine if thegraph you know the x and y axis couldmove but everything else was rigid Ijust move it up 3 units so thishorizontal asymptote that had been at yequals 0 will now be moved up here totwo y equals three okay and let's see acouple things here the the verticalasymptote is still in the same place solet's see this is still our x-axis andour y-axis now the the portion that hadbeen in the the bottom right it's goingto get moved up a little bit the portionthat had been and the bottom excuse methat the top left will get moved up soI'm going to move that part right uphere and I know this part's also goingto get shifted up so it's going to it'sbasically going to look like that wecould even find out this x-intercept ifwe wanted to we could find out thecoordinates because again to findx-intercepts we just plug in 0 for f ofX so we would get 0 equals negative 1over X plus 3we could add 1 over X to both sides I'mgoing to write 3 as 3 over 1 if we crossmultiply we would get 3x equals 1 or xequals 1/3 so it's actually crossing thex-axis here at this point at thex-coordinate of 1/3 and now we've gotour basic graph just again kind ofreflect it the 1 over x graph and moveit up so you know again you could alwaysplot points plot points plot points andget this general shape but this basicgraph 1 over X is a useful graph to knowso that you can kind of do all theseshifting and moving around of it to helpyou get new graphs
