hi my name is Maria and I'm amathematician and today I'm going toshow you how to teach converting akilogram to a gram and what you shouldremember is that King Henry doesn'tusually drink chocolate milk and if youcan remember that we can remember all ofour conversions K stands for the prefixkilo H is hecto DS deca U is 4 units Dis SEC sin T and M is milli what I meanby units is important it variesdepending on what we're talking about ifwe are talking about weight then we'retalking about the unit in grams if we'retalking about volume then we're talkingabout our unit and leaders and if we'retalking about distance then we'retalking about our unit in meters sobecause you asked about grams we'regoing to go ahead and focus on the gramsnow to convert from kilograms to gramsall I have to do is count how manyspaces it takes me to get from k to youso I'm going to go 1 2 3 it took me 3spaces to get there be careful not tocount when you start so don't go 1 2 youhave to count when you do a loop so fromk to H is 1 that's 2 and that's 3 so Imoved 3 spaces to the right so thatmeans that if I had 5 kilograms forexample and I want to know how manygrams that is what I'm going to do istake this 5 take the decimal that'sright after it and move it 3 spaces tothe right 1 2 3 and that's my newdecimal space I'm going to fill in myempties with zeros and that means that 5kilograms is equal to 5,000 grams sothat is how you teach converting fromkilograms into grams
