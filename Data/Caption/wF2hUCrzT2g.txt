all right doing addition and subtractionwith decimals is really no differentfrom doing ordinary addition subtractionin a 10-1 machine but if there's a 10:1machine after example twenty two pointthree seven plus five point eight fourone now I would personally go left toright to plus nothing is two two plusfive is seven point three five eight 11symbols for is also eleven and nothingplus one is one two point seven eleveneleven to one okay weirdit is typically correct so through isten on machine for this so let me drawsome boxes to ten on machine we've gottwo dots two dots three dots seven dotshope it's okay I just write numbersrather draw dots at this point add tothat five more dots and then eight fourand one and indeed I do have seven dotshere I do have $11 and I do have myjuice muddy smudging eleven dots they'regrand now can I fix that fix that up tosociety get that what you do is do someexplosions that it's a ten mod machineup draw so 10 dots he explored Canalleaving one dot behind making an extradot there to 8.1 eleven one stillmathematically fine Society thinks thatparts where's okay well picks up picksit up the society till explode kaboomthe ones up behind extra two dotsthere's bingo twenty-eight point two oneone in fact you can also go right toleft the standard way which me theschool way nothing plus one is onesymbols for is eleven but you might wantto it explosion right now just write aone and put an extra dot there and gothat way you'll get the same answerit's a style thing a subtraction exactlythe same thing for ordinary ten one workI would go left to right to take awayone just one to take away four isnegative two point three Tegra 5snegative 270 a great it's negative onezero take away one is negative onewhoa that's a very complicated one allright grand if I draw a picture this isthe scan one machine I guess I needthree decimal places yes I like two dotsin one anti dot will indeed make oneactual dot two dots and for anti dotswill indeed make two anti dots threedots and five anti dots will indeed maketwo anti dotsand eight will make one anti dot andnothing and an anti dot make anti dotbingoso now the question is guys fixed upthat crazy answer for societyI mean it's mathematically fine there'sjust weird okay justice yesI guess I have to deal with this dothere and I could unexploded just like wedid before this dot here is really 10dots here and then some annihilationswill occur be sample these two anti dotsor annihilate was two actual dotspuzzles so now I've got what eightnegative two negative one negative oneand I can now do it again one of thesemaking seven make an extra ten they'rebeing annihilations makes eight here onepoint eight negative one negative oneand so onin fact I'll leave the rest of work todo it for you if you'd like to work itout or use the standard algorithm gofrom right to left zero ticker one yousay can't do it so what do you do tounexploited one of these dots first makethem ten here and then do that it'llwork out brilliantlyand the same because all good correctmath is actually all good and allcorrect it's just a style what approachdo you like bestwhat suits you up to you grant so reallyno difference with addition andsubtraction all is good hereyou
