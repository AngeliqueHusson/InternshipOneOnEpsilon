so I service area volume of spheresserver seven volumes is let's draw asphere is big circle a Spears everysecond volume mysterious and now I'll doa little bells maybe like a an equatorif you willEcuador yes that would be accentuatingdifferent words to turn it into thecountry also never doing volume ofspheres service area and volume startwith surface area mixer before it'scrazy a while what we've been doingwe've been banging him out we've beendoing basically didn't I realize when wemoved all circles used also cookie goyeah I want to make sure I'm notdoubting myself at the very end you likethis new go when you're like going onthe war you like doing and I just did weshall avi yeah yeah it's like to gothat's been my experience being drawcircle just gotta come in he's got to gofor here's my questionablyI know you know the area of a circlewhat's the area in circle put it overhere a equals yeah rightr-squared correct so now that's the areaof this internal circle here noticethere's infinite circles we could drawinside this that our PI R squared aswell that's going to be getting put theare here for our friend three again nowhere's my questions you all want you tohold up with your fingers that's me howmany if you were to pull out this circlehow many could you sort of tape or stickaround the entire sphere how manycircles would fit around the tiny holdit with your fingers that's everyone geta chance to think you got three is aguest's threes a guessstill thinking oh yeahthinking how many do you thinkPossible's three is it a number that youcan actually hold up with your fingersyes it is it is no game no games onzeros is tenyeah we'll convert zero through ten okayyeah how many because that will be theformula for the surface area of theentire thing basically it's that numberthe PI R squared it's the number ofcircles you can fit around the entireball that number will go right here andthat's the formula isn't thatinteresting it is that number is gonnago right is a bit no so it's not sixokay Herman's not three it's not threeis this it it's not nine good guess isit it's not that you got one yeah I waslike question like this like it's onlythis no there's not one think about itif I wouldn't poll came out if I pulledthis circle out and I taped it onto alittle tray of it a tray yeah and Iglued it on that I would still have alot of the sphere exposed that makessense yeahthe good thing you don't understand howmany would fit around perfectlygenerally speaking you it wouldn'tactually fit perfectly I have to likemaybe you'd have overlap so it's justgood amount of space some say the amountof space toy that's just a wayindividualize cannot be actuallyvisualize indeed is for it's for me howdo you figure little it's just truth itstruth the number of circles that fitaround the entire sphere is equivalentto a form of these areas how do we knowwe know that's why we prune the way todo that would be to create a sphere findthat area of that sphere how do we dothat measure with piece of with the tapeor ruler right and then you would getthat total let's say well the area ofthis sphere we receive this circle it'dbe 9 PI 9 hi so basically what you haveto- which is pi 3 squared is 9 pi or do 9times 3.14 maybe like 30 or so on 30 andthen you would see how many if you couldtake that and like get a circle that's 9pi in an area or 30 units squared andjust glue it on top and see if you getroughly 4 generally you have overlapthough because you have circle andcircle and circle there be gasps mm butyou get the feel for itthat's that's the best that can answeryou yeah something sense yeah I thoughtyour choose to you fives - so it's justkind of like guessing good no it's justtruth but or you can experiment and seethat that's what it is you can visualizethat 4 of these circles will go aroundthe entire thing what's the totalsurface area of this sphere I docome on in this is your class like yoursalmon color t-shirt v29 by it's prettytimes no test for mix uh 36 5 units cuteI'm comingyeah questions sway basically fourcircles four circles makes the area ofthe entire face we'll do one moreproblem do the volume of this back dothe volume volume equals now this one ishard to visualize because yeah hi it'show much air you get into a body oh yesoh you're inside its space and sciencethe amount of sand it's the amount ofwater that can fit inside the ball wouldbe the volume okay gender sevendifference between service air is theoutside face oh yeahvolume is the space insideso we have higher qtr we need thiscoefficient this one is going to beharder to explain without using calculusbut this is pretty much how the formulagoes I think it's best if we leave theformula as it is right and that we getthe volume of this sphere using thisformula pretty much we've done with this4/3 pi what goes here me three what isthree cute where that play 727s go toBragg'sdo you agree we have cancellation policyoh yes you get none no kiddingwhat does this become nine I was rightthis becomes on so I've become 9multiplied through and we get and you636 pi is the what of this spirit divinecentimeters to stay as a service area isthat cool interesting yes enjoy schoolyeah is a coincidence that's the borderwhich they're the same okay now a funfacts fun facts what is the volume ofblue a hemisphere what's the volume ofthis thing looks like an eye would youjust take the curve the ball you havenever divide that cycle what I love withstudents use the word just yes that'sall you dothat's right so the volume of the wholething is 36 half of itso volume has an 18 plugs you're lookingfor yeah hey how much yeahatmosphere this 18 pi that's true verynice that's a good fun fact next funfact what is this a mess with you is thelast question of the day actually whatis the surface area of this hemispherethe surface areathis hemisphere which is kind ofinteresting I really like this questionof shape is that it looks like it lookslike than be happy like a Bogle likethat's like a bowl I guess but it's aspherical a bowl a gamble like a circlevaultyeah and you want the total surface areaBowl now do do you agree that we didsurface area a second ago of the entiresphere your call whit was so surfacearea of the whole sphere was four PI Rsquared again formulas will be provideddon't sweat itoh thank Billy or I know it's a lot it'sa lot it's using them using themappropriately three squared this is fourpi times nine this is 36 five is thewhole thing what is the surface area ofthis outside shape over here the bottomof the bowl what is itbut to you what is the surface area it's36 PI is in service over the entirespherewhat's the service area in the bottomhalf oh oh we just did before so 35 itis an teen pot that's right now lookhere's the issue though friends how dowe know it's exactly happens from thisfear because a hemisphere means half itwill tell us that it's answer or willlook like a mr. so it's to scale okayjust know what happened appears likehalf if it appears like half it's okaythis is 18 pi now here's the issue youguys when you slice open the sphere youcreate an additional face so the surfacearea is not done the surface area of theblue stuff is 18 high surfaces are theblue stuff seems impossible we have itdone the surface area of this top faceyet it's interesting right if you cut itopenI'm coming up rowm stuff if you cut itopenyes you have a surface area to theoutside but younew face so we have to add the area ofthis to the 18 PI R squareyes that's right and what is the area ofthis face 9 9 pi put it down9 that's a circle it is so it's a normalarea in circle correct correct socket soit's 9 5 plus 36 5 plus 18 5 no nothat's not you're talking about oh no nosir 18 plus 9 minus 4 36 minus 18 is nothigh I think you're overcomplicating itin a way what's the area of the outsidebowl the blue 18 one fairy top face 36PI minus 27 36 is no longer bits 27 potwhich I find that sir there is thebottom part and the top togetheroh and overs this is subtracted from thewhole thing you think we already dividedthis a nap this was the whole thing thewhole thing they cut it open so we have18 at the bottom we've removed the topthrough side okay so we're 18 is thebottom created a new face when we openthis then new face of 9 I so actuallythe surface area of the hemisphere havea finishequals was it leave it please in 27 unitthere's centimeters follow-up questionon that does that make sense to youI thought I candidly okay Jamie likeokay we create a new face when you opena hemisphere it's the idea is that okayperfectyeah here's our warriors okay giveyourselves a flatter yourselves a flatwe're gonna clap it up yeah flap it upwhy you have that much energy
