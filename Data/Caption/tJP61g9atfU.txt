welcome today I'd like to address aquestion a basic question that a lot ofpeople have trouble with explaining thatif you have an inequality say a is lessthan B and on a my apply through by anegative number like negative one maybeso I have negative a and negative Bapparently the rule is that you meant toflip the inequality sign so why on earthdoes multiply by negative in thatquantity force you to flip theinequality sign that's the question ofthe today all right so I ordered areally asked this question is is try toset up a swim some principles but whatdo I believe that inequalities so ownershave a model here suppose measurementdid like a balance was with bags ofapples his bag a and bag be a chilly ais less than B those B has more applesin it than bag eight us so if I actuallyput these things on a balance of his abalance and his the bag of apples on oneside of the balance was it's telling methat a has less apples in it therefore ais lighter than B so the balance wouldbalance would be filled it this way allright what we like to believe about thismodel well if I add an apple to bothsides then I believe nothing's gonnachange the scales that he'll be tippedin this manner so I've had a is lessthan B adding one any one I stillbelieve it's the inner cosine waves asfollows if ever add another two applesto both sidesI still believe it's balanced tipped inthis way so I guess I'd like to believethat a plus X will always be less than Bplus X is less than B then adding X toboth sides preserves the inequality andlet me be honest at least for positivenumbers X now well if I wanted to addnegative numbers to both sidesdo I still believe it now what I mean byadding negative numbers I'm going to addnegative apples anti apples to bothsides here's an anti up on the leftand here's an anti-death Lana right it'slike adding negative one to both sideswell what happens to an apple and an DApple I guess they not at each other soit really is adding negative one is likethis really means to take away an appleso I take my F on both sides yes I'dlike to believe it still be tip this waywell if I add anti to apples both sidesthat does take away two here and takeaway two here it's add negative two toboth sidesdo I still be the the this tipping isbalanced this waybut if I take away an apple from a sohave to me for draw and take me out frombe simple go way in there I stillbelieve that a minus one is going to belighter than B minus one so I guess Ibelieve this rule works for all X's if Xis a positive numberI believe it if X is a negative number Iguess I'm gonna believe itall right what else do we believe thatabout this picture of of two bags ofapples my pictures gonna get messy nowbut suppose I double the number of bagson the left and double the bags on therice have to bear gaze on the left andtwo big bees on the rightwell if a was lighted to be in the beginwith the silly two A's is still light intwo piece so to a I still believe it'sgonna be less than 2 B so I believenothing's changed about the inequalitysign for multiplying by two but if Itriple the number bags and left in rightI believe it's still going to preservethe inequality sign or for mop up afraction if suppose I did only half abag of a there's half a bag of a andhalf a bag of B there's half a bag of BI still believe that's gonna be lighterthan thatso even half of a is less than half of Bso it looks like I'm also deleteconvincing myself that multiplyingthrough by a positive number stillpreserves the inequality sign and I'mbeing honest herea positive number positive X's I guessit's the negative X's this is scaring usall right but that's enough if I believethese two rules then I am forced toconclude that I'll multiply through bynegative quantity I'm gonna have to flipthat inequality sign it's a rule thatI've been told to memorize but now I'mgonna see why it's actually true heregoesso notice how I'm very very careful inmy language here that if you choose tobelieve these two rules then you forceto believe you could force to operate inthe following way about negativemultiply through by negative numbers nowthis addition if we believe these rulesit seems to work for apples at least youknow let's have mathematicians phrasethings he goes if I believe rule numberone let's go see what happensa would Suniva penned a is less than Bbut rule number one but water add toboth sides if it's positive or negativeit still has to preserve the inequalitysign so be sneaky I'm gonna add an antibag of a to both sideswell if I believe that rule that meanszero is less than B minus a and now if Iam add an anti bag would be to bothsides which recorded this rule arebelievers who can preserve theinequality sign I'll see some nicethings happen negative B will be lessthan negative a now that's it that'spretty easy that's that's all I did addsubtract a from both sides straight beefinside so I believe that's true startwith that and I end up with this thereason why were to flip the inequalitysigns that were insisting that we stillread A to B from left to right a lessthan B now I've got B to the left and ato the right I want to rewrite this sothat S on the left and B is to the rightso to flip this equation over which isnot mathematical it's just mechoosing the right a on the left and Bon the right which in effect what have Idone is flip the inequality sign so theonly reason we flipped the integralassigned by multiply by negative numbersreally because we prefer to keep thequantities in the order they first readin we read them in that's basically itthe admins are very Swift all is justalgebra to take away a from both sidestake R and B from both sides you've gotit in a story that's why flip theinequality sign because we then want toread still things from left to right allright um that's multiplied by negativeone well if I'm a high through bynegative 2 well that's usually that'snot tricky first of all I might do tomultiply by negative two so first of allmultiply by 2 so let me write this outso you don't need a pen suppose a isless than B if we like to believe thisrule is true for all positive numbersthen 2 only less than 2 B and to getthis then to be 4 negative 2 is 7multiplied by 2 multiplied by negative 2it's more power through by negative 1now I get negative 2 a is greater thannegative 2 B because I just provedmoments ago both on by negative 1 in thesense for it's the inequality sign somultiply by negative 2 has had the sameeffect if I'm all done by any negativenumbers the same as first of allmultiplied by X doesn't do anything toinequality and then multiply by negative1 in sense flips in a holy son so that'sitwelcomed by any negative quantity webelieve or played this game has to flipthe inequality sign now I've got like aweird physics question here right mybrains likes to have funwe talked about apples and anti applesand so forth moments ago so if I had awas my picture was a scale versus I needa pen it was a bag bead with more applesthan a bag a and we looked at the anteversion of a ante version of B well Isaid aunty apples if I had an ante bagthey've ever have had an ante B bagsworth of apples I'm not trying to saybut look at Auntie B that's a bag of beanti apples now a lot of apples way downthat's actual applesI guess anti apples must do the exactopposite of being weighed down bygravity I bet they wait out by gravityso if Bank B is more apples in it thenbeg auntie B has more anti apples in itso you know a is being weighed down lessthat means anti a is being pulled upless Antibes being pulled up a lot so ifI draw to skip draw the scale picturefor anti apples I'm not making any senseof for like I'm rambling right nowwhere's my pen gone if you lose my pen abag of Antibes can be pulled up morethan a bag of anti a that's basicallyI'm trying to say which I guess is apicture of this guy see it's my realphysics question do physicists believethat antimatter actually here is an tingevery possible sense that the massiveantiparticles are still being weigheddown by gravity order the mass of antiparticles get weighed up by gravity insome sense so I guess my researchquestion here is what the physicistsbelieve about antimatter if I really hadan anti apple is the mass of that thingbeing pulled up or do they blew themasses will be pulled down just havediscussion with emphasis about this lastnight over dinnerso there's actually something to betalked about here yeah that's a sillyrant any question in the end to flip totwo x negative number just subtract afrom both sides subtract B from bothsides and you'll be forced to concludethat you flip the inequality sign that'sit in three seconds all rightrandomly video sorry about that thanksvery muchyou
