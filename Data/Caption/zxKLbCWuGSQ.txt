okay in this video I just want to dosome more examples factoring thedifference of two squares so again Ilook at this and I think well hey I'vegot two terms 16x squared and my othersmy 25 y squared there's a I'msubtracting them so anytime I have anegative between two terms that alwaysfactors and again I'm basically justtaking the square root of the first termso the square root of 16x squared againwhat multiplied by itself would be 16xsquared we would just need a 4x and a 4xand then I do the same thing for the 25y squaredI would simply need a 5y and 5y andagain the formula says you stick apositive and a negative in between theterms and again that's now how itfactors so let's do our other examplehere 64 x squared minus 81 Y squared sohere I'm just trying to make a littlebarrier here just to separate them solet's see so I'm going to make my twosets of parentheseslet's see okay it's the same thing I didI just take the square root of 64 xsquared I would get 8 X + 8 X I do thesame thing with 81 y squared I would get9 y + 9 Y and again to stick a positiveand a negative in between them and younow have it factored so again notice ifyou do multiply it out we'll get 64 xsquared we'll get a negative 72 X Y butwe'll also get a positive 72 X Y whichcancels and then we get our negative 9ysquared just like we want
