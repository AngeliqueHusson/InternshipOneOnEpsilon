- WELCOME TO A LESSON ON POINTS 
AND ORDERED PAIRS.THE GOALS OF THIS VIDEO 
ARE TO PLOT POINTSIN THE COORDINATE PLANEAND ALSO TO DETERMINE 
THE COORDINATES OF POINTSON THE COORDINATE PLANE.TO GRAPH OR PLOT POINTS WE USE 
TWO PERPENDICULAR NUMBER LINESCALLED AXES.THE HORIZONTAL NUMBER LINE 
IS CALLED THE X-AXIS,AND WE HAVE THE POSITIVE X 
VALUES ON THE RIGHTAND THE NEGATIVE X VALUES 
ON THE LEFT.AND THE VERTICAL NUMBER LINE 
IS CALLED THE Y-AXIS,AND THE POSITIVE Y VALUES 
ABOVE THE X-AXIS,AND THE NEGATIVE Y VALUES 
ARE BELOW THE X-AXIS.THE POINT AT WHICH THE AXES 
CROSS IS CALLED THE ORIGIN,HERE, AND EVERY POINT ON THE 
COORDINATE PLANE IS IDENTIFIEDBY WHAT'S CALLED 
AN ORDERED PAIR.EVERY ORDERED PAIR CONSISTS OF 
AN X COORDINATEAND A Y COORDINATE.AND THE X COORDINATE TELLS 
WHETHER TO GO LEFT OR RIGHTON THE COORDINATE PLANE,AND THE Y COORDINATE TELLS YOU 
WHETHER TO GO UP OR DOWNON THE COORDINATE PLANE.SO LET'S CONSIDER 
THE ORDERED PAIR (4, 3).AS WE JUST STATED THE FIRST 
COORDINATE IS THE X COORDINATE,AND THE SECOND COORDINATE 
IS THE Y COORDINATE.SO TO PLOT THE POINT (4, 3) 
ON THE COORDINATE PLANEWE START AT THE ORIGIN,AND WE MOVE HORIZONTALLY 
TO THE RIGHT FOUR UNITSSINCE THE X COORDINATE IS +4.THEN WE MOVE VERTICALLY UP 
THREE UNITSBECAUSE THE Y COORDINATE IS +3, 
AND THEN WE MAKE A POINT.THIS IS THE POINT (4, 3).LET'S GO AHEAD AND TRY 
A FEW MORE OF THESE.WE WANT TO PLOT 
THE FOLLOWING POINTS.AND AGAIN, I THINK IT'S HELPFUL 
TO THINK THAT THE X COORDINATETELLS YOU WHETHER TO GO LEFT 
OR RIGHT,AND THE Y COORDINATE TELLS YOU 
WHETHER YOU NEED TO GO UPOR DOWN BASED UPON THE SIGN.SO FOR THE POINT A--AND WE USUALLY IDENTIFY POINTS 
BY CAPITAL LETTERS.SO FOR POINT A, 
WHICH HAS COORDINATES (-3, 2),SINCE THE X COORDINATE 
IS NEGATIVE 3,WE START AT THE ORIGIN AND GO 
LEFT THREE UNITS THIS TIME,AND THEN UP TWO UNITS BECAUSE 
THE Y COORDINATE IS +2,AND WE MAKE A POINT.THIS WOULD BE POINT A.THE NEXT POINT, POINT B 
HAS AN X COORDINATE OF -1SO WE GO LEFT ONE,AND THEN THE Y COORDINATE 
IS +4 SO WE GO UP FOUR UNITS.SO LEFT ONE UNIT, 
UP FOUR UNITS TO POINT B.POINT C, X COORDINATE IS -2 
SO WE GO LEFT TWO UNITS,AND THE Y COORDINATE IS -4 NOWSO WE GO DOWN FOUR UNITS 
TO POINT C.D HAS THE COORDINATES (0, -2).THIS ZERO TELLS US WE DO NOT GO 
LEFT OR RIGHT AT ALL.WE STAY RIGHT AT THE ORIGIN,BUT WITH THE Y COORDINATE OF -2 
WE NEED TO GO DOWN TWO UNITS.AND LASTLY, THE POINT (3,0).THIS 3 TELLS US TO GO 
RIGHT THREE UNITS,AND THE Y COORDINATE OF ZERO 
TELLS US THATWE DO NOT GO UP OR DOWN. 
WE STAY RIGHT ON THE X-AXIS.SO THE POINT (3, 0) WOULD BE 
RIGHT HERE ON THE X-AXIS.LET'S GO AHEAD AND TRY THIS 
IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION NOW.WE'RE GIVEN SEVERAL POINTS 
THAT ARE PLOTTEDAND WE WANT TO IDENTIFY 
THE COORDINATES.WELL THE EASIEST WAY TO DO THIS 
IS JUST DRAW A LINESTRAIGHT TO THE X-AXIS 
AND STRAIGHT TO THE Y-AXIS.AS WE CAN SEE THE X COORDINATE 
IS +1AND THE Y COORDINATE IS +5.SO A HAS THE ORDERED PAIR 
(1, 5).WE DO NEED TO BE CAREFUL THAT 
WE LIST THE X COORDINATE FIRST.SO FOR POINT B 
THE X COORDINATE WOULD BE -6,AND THE Y COORDINATE +2.POINT C, THE X COORDINATE IS -2, 
AND THE Y COORDINATE IS -4.D, THE X-COORDINATE +4, 
Y COORDINATE -4.NOTICE E IS RIGHT 
ON THE Y-AXIS.AGAIN, WE FOLLOW THE SAME RULES.DRAW A SEGMENT STRAIGHT TO THE 
X-AXIS, WHICH WOULD BE ZERO.AND THE POINT IS ON THE Y-AXIS 
RIGHT AT -2.SO THE COORDINATES WOULD BE 
(0, -2).AND LASTLY, POINT F, 
THE X COORDINATE WOULD BE 7,AND THE Y COORDINATE WOULD BE 
ZERO.NOW WE CAN CHECK OUR WORK 
ON THE GRAPHING CALCULATORBECAUSE THE GRAPHING CALCULATOR 
WILL PLOT POINTS.SO WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IS GO 
AHEAD AND ENTER THESE POINTSIN THE CALCULATOR 
AND SEE IF IT MATCHES OUR GRAPH.THE WAY WE ENTER IN POINTS 
TO BE PLOTTEDIS WE HIT THE STAT KEY, ENTER.THEN WE'LL ENTER IN 
ALL OF THE X COORDINATES IN L1AND ALL OF THE Y COORDINATES 
IN L2.AND THIS WORKS JUST LIKE EXCELSO WHEN YOU HIT ENTER IT DROPS 
DOWN TO THE NEXT CELL.NOW WE ENTER 
ALL THE Y COORDINATES.NEXT WE WILL PRESS SECOND 
Y EQUALS,AND WE NEED TO TURN ON THE STAT 
PLUS SO WE PRESS ENTER.WHEN IT'S BLINKING ON 
ON WE HIT ENTER.THIS FIRST OPTION HERE 
IS TO PLOT POINTS,WHICH IS WHAT WE WANT. 
WE HAVE OUR X COORDINATES IN L1.WE HAVE OUR Y COORDINATES IN L2,AND WE CAN SELECT THE TYPE 
OF POINT WE'D LIKE TO PLOT.I'LL GO AHEAD AND LEAVE IT 
ON THIS FIRST OPTION.NOW TO MAKE IT LOOK EXACTLY 
LIKE THIS ONEWE SHOULD CHOOSE 
THE SAME WINDOW.SO IF WE PRESS WINDOW 
AND CHANGE THE X MIN TO -8AND THE X MAX TO +8,AND THE Y VALUES START AT -6 
AND GO UP TO +6.NOW WE CAN PRESS GRAPH,AND WE CAN SEE THAT THIS GRAPH 
DOES MATCH THE GRAPHTHAT WE SEE ON THIS SLIDE.SO THAT'S A NICE WAY 
TO CHECK YOUR WORKIF YOU HAVE A GRAPHING 
CALCULATOR.I HOPE YOU FOUND THIS 
VIDEO HELPFUL.THANK YOU AND HAVE A NICE DAY.
