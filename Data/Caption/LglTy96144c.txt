okay in this video I'll show you guyshow to convince others that we cannotdivide it by 0 and before I do this Ihave to do some pepper with you guys solet's look at the rigor division such as1 over 4 which is the same as saying 1divided by 4 right and suppose I do nothave a calculator to do this I will haveto use the long division and now let meask you what goes inside where it's anumber on the top or the first numberright here if you're looking atdiffusion simpler here right so you knowone goes inside and the whole goes onthe outside and then now what you askyourself focus into 1 how many times 4goes into 1 0 times so you could answerright here but I still want to continueit don't want to give our here I don't -the more it's not there the more one tosay missing one point zero and now I canlook here for right here and this islike 10 4 goes into 10 twice 2 times 4is 8 and you subtract 10 minus 80 is 2and then just go and do it you can stillcontinue codons right here and bringthat down and then 4 goes into 20 fivetimes and put down this right here youknow you are done because you make theprogress this is zero not for theremainder so you know this is equal to0.25 and everybody copy right good nowlet's look at what happened when wedivide it by zero this is just as crazyas that I'm using a purple pen rightanyway let's look at one why not but anynumber will work let's say I have 1 over0 in another word we can look at this as1 divided by 0 you can look at this as afollowing if somebody think that he wasshe can divide by 0 we can do the proofby contradiction right suppose talkingthat you could do it and make him or herdo that right so let's go ahead and usea long division for this and not bereally careful what goes inside onceagain you will be the number on the topor the first number right for the 1 goesinside and in this case the throw willbe going from the outside hereso suppose we can divide by 0 let's tryit and see what happened and now let meask you what comes through what give us1[Music]what comes through will keep us one whattime zero keep us one if you put down 25times 0 they'll be 0 and actually let mejust I work something out with you guysok let's not put on Tony but let me puton sa 9 why not9 times 0 is 0 1 minus 0 is 1 thisnumber looks Li familiar because I thinkthat was the original questionunfortunately night didn't work becauseI didn't make any progress because theone is gone yeah right so nice not theanswer all rightand now let's do Kate maybe I had thewine size around outside maybe I justyou know had a bad luck I chose 9earlier maybe let me choose the numberof 7 lucky number seven why not right7 times zero is zero and you see oneminus zero once again this one looksdope from the right you see right herehere we have trouble because it doesn'tmatter what we put right here thisnumber times zero it's always 0 and 1minus Rho is still one which cannotreduce this right so there's no numberthat we can put here multiply by zero toproduce one just no answer for it sotherefore this right here we told youthis to be undefined it because nomatter how how we try I should not putan equal sign or some tough years rightno matter how how we we cannot findanswer so that we multiply with 0 weproduce 1 all right so this is it andhere's a small bonus part what do you Iam trying to do so you roll over onewhat's the answer for this now this isthe same of thing 0 divided by 1 rightokay long division what goes inside thetop number was the first number which is0 here and then this number which is onegoes in goes in the front rightwhat times 1 will be 0 where we know 0times 1 will be 0 0 minus 0 hey look atthatthe remainder is 0 just like that oneisn't itso when you have a sear on the top from/ what this is 0 this is the answer allrightthis is the answer for that so righthere let me be legitimate for you guysbefore we go right here when we have anynon-zero number the body by 0 this righthere yes and we find it all right wehave no answer for that so if you canput down 2500 study to divide by 0negative 17 keep up as you roll all ofthem you know hard to find it and inthis case here when you have 0 dividedby any nonzero number okay this righthere in fact you always have an answerwhich is 0 so in other word for examplethroughout divided by 5 is 0 0 dividedby negative 22 0 0 t power up is equalto 0 0 T bar bar is also equal to 0 allright all right so you may be one thingfighting the world through of a circlethat's for another video but anyway thisis the for now hopefully you guys likethis this is kind of like proof bycontradiction this is how you can showothers to convince others that he wasshe cannot divide it by 0 but just soyou can prove he was she cannot flyright that's it[Music]you[Music]
