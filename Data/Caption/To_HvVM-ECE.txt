get out and welcome to tech math Channelwhat we're gonna be having a look at inthis video is this is gonna be the lastof the it's sort of a culmination oflooking at SIDS where we're looking atour head basically how to do some morecomplex operations with them downyeah we've looked at multiplying anddividing so as we looked at additionobserves we also look at simplifying sothere's videos are probably reallyreally good if you haven't seen them yetbut basically what they show were acouple things first off thirds what theyare is they're a type of number which isgently expressed as a root of it anotherthing number a root of a number so saysomething like square root through thesquare root of threenow we've worked out that thirds in thethird in the multiplication he workedout in thirds could be multiplied so saysomething like the square root of atime's the square root of B was equal tothe square root of a times bass andsquare root say three times the squareroot of two he's not the square root ofsix okay or divided which is a veryvice-versa thing of those I'm not goingto write that particular all down wealso found out the terms that had thesame surge could be added or subtractedon you in example is so so say ifsomething was like the square root threetimes the square root of a plus fourtimes the square root of a we end upwith say seven times the square root ofa so these could be directly added likethis we also found that we couldactually simplify certain SERDESif the number under the square root signhad a factor which was a perfect squarein a perfect squarewe'll say something like where 2 squaredequals 4 or 3 squared go through thoseprevious videos and get those or if youunderstand that already you'll be finefor this next thing we're gonna talkabout it so if you have even you begin astruggle with those I recommend you goand have a look so let's have a bit of alook at the type of questions and we'relooking at the Indies okay so this isthis type of question so say you couldsay something like the square root offive and we're gonna be multiplying thisbite something in brackets here throughtwice the square root of three okay thisis nice and simple to start off now theway that we do this is as followsnow this is fairly simple we're justgonna multiply this number by thisnumber and this number this number it'sjust a matter of expanding the bracketso we're gonna start out doing a fairlybasic ones of these and then we're gonnaget some more complex ones so this isequal tothe square root of five times two okaythis one's here and we're going to addthis to the square root of 5 which istime to buy the square root 3 okay andso we can actually then take this alittle bit further and two times thesquare root of 5 is 2 square root 5 and3 times the square root of the squareroot of 5 times the square root of 3well that was equal to that are and whenyou multiply since this is equal to thesquare root of 15 okay we can't simplifythis any further so this is our answer Iknow once again with thirds it sometimesdoesn't feel like you've actually got ananswer this is their answer here okaybecause we can't actually get this downto factors which are gonna work reallynicely over here as well so okay that'sthat's this what it is all right nowlet's have a look at a harder type ofquestion hereso what about we do this particular onehere say we do so we had this one herethe square root of three and we at atime just by two plus the square root ofthree okay so if we were doing this theway we do this is follow so again wejust multiplied we're gonna expand thesebrackets out and then try to simplifythem okay so first we're gonna multiplythese two terms then we know multiplythese two terms okay so we're gonna havefirst off the square root of three timestwo and we're gonna be adding that tothe square root of three times thesquare root three now you might thinkwell the square root of three times thesquare root of three is actually gonnabe three okay so our answer here isgoing to be two times the square root ofthree plus threeokay I'm gonna give you one more examplewith these okay these aren't thesearen't too bad but they just take alittle while to get used to so say we doseven times the square root of two andwe're going to multiply that by thesquare root of six this is in bracketstake away the square root of three okaynice and nasty looking one yeah so whenwe do this we get as follows we're goingto go 7 times the square root of 2 andwe're first off we're going to multiplythis by this number here which is whythis set by the square root of 6 andthis is taking away 7 times a square andso we're multiplying this byI swear this raceokay so this is what we're we're stuckwith so far so can we take this anyfurtherwell you can't now the way we do this isas follows so we what we do now is we'regonna multiply this guy so I'm gonna endup with seven then we can multiply theseguys straight through so this one so I'mjust one is seven square roots well thenthis is gonna be taking away 7 times thesquare root and multiply these ones ofsix okay because it when we multiply weget that sort of answer so what do weget now well you might remember thatthis perfect square idea this onedoesn't have any factors ago until thisone does this one has four and three sothis we can actually take even furtherand we can say this is equal to so seventimes the square root of four timesthree take away seven times the squareroot of six so again we can take this alittle bit further the square root offour is two so this becomes two years ortwo times seven is 14 14 times thesquare root of three and this is gonnabe taking away seven times the squareroot of six yeah these are their lowestfactors at the moment they can't go anyfurtherso we leave it at this so how did you gowith that that was your answer therethese are not the easiest thing ever Ithink they will find a little little bittricky cuz it's often hard to our knowwhen to I stop with the things but uh orwhere to head with them but hopefullyyou've done okay with them all rightanyway hopefully that was a some helpwith you anyway see you next time
