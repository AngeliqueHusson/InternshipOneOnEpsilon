to understand the types of angles weneed to understand just one simplediagram consider array or a we know thatif this ray is rotated completely onceit covers 360 degrees all the differentangles which lie in between 0 and 360degrees are classified into types thereare two kinds of important angles wecome across very often in mathematicsthe first kind is an angle like this andit covers one fourth of the 360 degreesrotation let's call this ray o see thisangle formed here is called a rightangle and since it covers one fourth ofthe 360 degreesit measures 90 degrees this angle isspecial in many ways it is the onlyangle which is not marked with a curvenormally angles a mark like this with acurve between its two arms but a rightangle is marked like this with this markwe don't even need to write the measurenext to it since these two lines areenough to tell you that it's a rightangle and when the angle between tworays or lines is 90 degrees we say theyare perpendicular to each other the nextimportant kind of angle you will seeoften is called the straight angle thename says it all the arm is rotated insuch a way that a straight line isformed like this let this arm be calledor e this angle formed here between o ayand o e will equal 180 degrees it iscalled a straight angle and thisstraight angle covers half the completerotation which is 180 degrees soremember one fourth of a completerotation is a right angle and half acomplete rotation is called a straightangle which is actually a straight linethese two were the special angles and ifyou look at the figure closely these twoangles divide the plane into threeregions let me color them for you thisblue region which is between 0 and 90degrees this yellow region which isbetween 90 degrees and 180 degrees andthis entire red Ridgeunder the line which is between 180degrees and 360 degrees we classify theangles purely based on these threeregions to classify the angles in thisfigure we will consider rate or a as theinitial arm for all angles any angle inthe blue region is called an acute anglelet's have another ray or B in the blueregion this angle formed here will be anacute angle any angle with its terminalarm between 0 and 90 degrees can becalled acute any angle formed with itsterminal arm in the yellow region willbe an obtuse anglelet this be another ray or D in theyellow region this angle formed here iscalled an obtuse angle that means anyangle which has its measure between 90and 180 degrees is called an obtuseangle and any angle with its terminalarm in this red region is called areflex angle so if you have Ray Oh Flike this then this entire anglestarting from Ray Oh a will be a reflexangle so a reflex angle will always begreater than 180 degrees but less than360 degrees and if we have Ray or G likethis then this big angle to would be areflex angle it's very simple any anglebetween 0 and 90 degrees will be acuteif it's between 90 and 180 degrees itwill be obtuse and if it's between 180degrees and 360 degrees it will bereflex one way in which you can rememberthis is by knowing that the letters a orand are are in alphabetical orderthis recording from math open-roof calmwill help us understand better if theterminal arm lies anywhere between 0 and90 degrees it will be an acute angle youcan move the terminal arm anywhere inbetween 0 and 90 the angle will still beacute at 90 degrees it becomes a rightangle these two rays are said to beperpendicular to each other anywherebetween 90 and 180 degrees it will becalled an obtuse angle you can see thatthe wide range of angles are coveredbetween 90 and 180 degrees and the angleis still Optus and at 180 degrees we geta straight line or a straight angleanywhere between 180 degrees and 360degrees it will be a reflex angle anyterminal arm in this entire region willresult in a reflex angle and 360 degreescomplete one full rotation and it willbe called a full angleyouyou
