hey everybody this is Paul in thistutorial I'll be showing you how to findthe greatest common denominator by usingthe Euclidean algorithm so for thisfirst example I've got the numbers 10and 45 and the greatest commondenominator is going to be the largestnumber that divides both 10 and 45evenly so in this case it's going to bethe number 5 but if we couldn't see thatwe could use the Euclidean algorithm tofind the same answer so what we do is wetake the larger of the two numbers so inthis case it's going to be 45 and thenwe set it equal to the smaller numbertimes some number Q plus some number Rso the Q is how many times 10 goes into45 the R is the remainder of that resultso for our case it's going to be 45 isequal to 10 times 4 plus 5 10 goes into45 4 times with a remainder of 5 so thenext step and all the remaining steps iswe take the number that's in thisposition and we move it to where thisnumber was on the left hand side andthen we take our remainder and we moveit to where this number was and we justkind of follow this pattern all the waydown until we get a remainder of 0 sofor our case we're just going to get ridof the 45 and move the 10 where the 45was and then the 5 goes where the 10 wasso now we're asking ourselves 5 goesinto 10 how many times 2 times with aremainder of 0 so now that we have aremainder of 0 we simply look back atthe previous remainder and this is ourgreatest common denominator for theoriginal two numbers so let's try thisfor this bigger example here now so wetake the larger of the two numbers 3768and set that equal to 1701 the smallernumber times some number plus someremainder while 1701 goes into 37682 times with a remainder of 366 nowmoving this to the left-hand side here1701 is equal to 366 moving that overtimes four and that's plus 237 so 366goes into 1701 four times with aremainder of 237 moving the 366 to theleft-hand side now 237 where the 366 wasso 237 goes into 366 one time with aremainder of 1 29 to 37 moving that tothe left-hand side now 129 goes wherethe 237 was and 129 goes into 237 onetime with a remainder of 108 moving the129 to the left-hand side now and the108 to where the 129 was 108 goes into129 one time with a remainder of 21 108is equal to moving the 1 or moving the21 over here so 108 is equal to 21 times5 plus 3 and then one last step heremoving the 21 to the left-hand side21 moving the 3 to where the 21 was 3divides 21 goes into 21 seven times witha remainder of 0so now we just simply look back to ourprevious remainder and this is thegreatest common denominator of ouroriginal two numbers so the greatestcommon denominator of 1701 and 3768 isthe number 3 so you guys have anexcellent day thank you for watching andif you haven't already don't forget tosubscribe
