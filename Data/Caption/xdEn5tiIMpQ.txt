see how we can find the distance betweentwo points let this be our number linewhere we have numbers from minus 1 to 6and these are two points on the numberline what is the distance between pointa and B one way in which we can figureout the distance is by counting thenumber of units in between a and B thereare 4 units 1 2 3 & 4 it means that thedistance between a and B is 4 units butthis method is tedious if there are manyunits in between which tells us that wehave to look for an easier way to findthe distance how do we find the distancebetween points a and B here look at thenumbers under points a and B it's 1 & 5the distance between points a and Bequals absolute value of 5 minus 1 whichequals 4 there are a few things welearnt here first the distance between aand B is written like this D and then aB in brackets the distance is theabsolute value of the difference betweenthe endpoints of segment a B here theendpoints are 5 & 1remember it's the absolute value of thedifference so it can also be written asabsolute value of 1 minus 5 the absolutevalue ignores the sign of the numberso even absolute value of 1 minus 5 willequal 4 but it is always a good practiceto subtract the smaller number from thelarger number we should also know thatthe distance between points a and B isthe same as length of segment a B solength of segment a B in this exampleit's 4 units here's another example thistime we have to find the distancebetween points C and D the first thingyou should do is look at the endpointsof the segmentthe endof the segments are two and minus two sothe distance between the points C and Dwill be absolute value of two minusnegative two two minus negative two isfor an absolute value of 4 is for thelength of segment CD is four units inthe next video we will understand thisbetter with the help of coordinate axis
