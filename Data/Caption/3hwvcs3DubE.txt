hi so in today's video we are going tolearn about the exterior angles first welearn what are the exterior angles of apolygon and after that we'll derive aformula to find the sum of the exteriorangles of a polygon right so let me drawa polygon first so let this be thepolygon these are the two points it'sthe third point and it is the fourthpoint and let me have this as the fifthpoint so what is this yes it is apendulum right so it is a Pentagon andwhat are the exterior angles of apolygon if I extend these sides or theedges of a polygonthen this newly-formed angle this iscalled an exterior angle right let mecall it exterior angle number one and asyou know we were calling these angles asinterior angles the angles which I ammarking in red we were calling them asinterior angles right so these are theinterior angles and then we extend theedge on one side then the angle formbetween that extended edge and the nextside is called exterior angle right andthere is only one rule for extendingthese lines like if I have extended thisedge towards right I have to extend allother edges towards right only if Iextend like this this will be theexterior angle and since I have extendedthese two lines towards the right I haveto extend all other lines towards rightonly so this edge will be extended inthis direction and then if I have toextend this edge I have to extend in inthis direction and this edge will alsobe extended in this direction right sowhat are the exterior angles all theseangles newly-formed angles will beexterior angles right and since I havecalled this as angle number one I'llcall this one as two this one as threethis one as four and this one as fiveright so if we have a Pentagon we aregoing to have five interior angles andat the same time we will also have fiveexterior angles so how to find the sumof the exterior angles so one method iswe can derive the formula if you see allthese points this point this point thispoint this point and this point theseare the vertices of the polygon rightand at every point we have a pair ofinterior angle plus exterior angle rightat every point we have one interiorangle and one exterior angle oneinterior armor exterior and what can yousay about this pair yes together theyare making a straightor the street angle right so some offinterior plus exterior angles will beequal to 180 multiplied by n where n isthe number of vertices right but what isthe sum of interior angles for a polygonthe sum of interior angles was n minus 2multiplied by 180 right so this plus sumof exterior angles is equal to 180multiplied by n rightso from here sum as exterior angles willbe 180 n minus 180 multiplied by n minus2 right this can be written as 180multiplied by n minus n plus 2 right ifI take 180 comment from these two termsinside the bracket will have n from hereand then this minus will get multipliedinside the bracket and will have minus nplus 2 right so this plus N and minus nwill get cancelled and 180 multiplied by2 is actually 360 degrees isn't it yesso this suggests that some of exteriorangles of a polygon is equal to 360degrees right
