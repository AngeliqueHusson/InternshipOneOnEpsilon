let's generally try to understand whatsimilar figures are here's a triangleand here's another triangle of the sameshape but a smaller size theirorientation their look is the same buttheir size differs these types offigures are called similar figuresthey're of the same shape but havedifferent sizes now look at thisquadrilateral this is a smallerquadrilateral which is similar to thisbigger quadrilateral so similarity neednot exist only between triangles theycan exist with any figure and here's anoctagon this bigger octagon whichemerges from it is similar to thesmaller octagon remember similar figureswill always have the same shape but theymay or may not have the same size so ifwe have another octagon of the exactshape and size of this bigger octagonthen these two figures are also similarbut figures of the same shape and sizeare called congruent figures so similarfigures will always have the same shapeand may or may not have the same sizeyou
