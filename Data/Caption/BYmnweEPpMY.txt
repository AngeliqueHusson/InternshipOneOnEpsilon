hello my name is Maria from math mammothcalm in this lesson we study how tochange or convert fractions intodecimals there's two basic methods oneis we can sometimes use equivalentfractions with a denominator of 10 or100 or 1000 and so on powers of 10 andthe other method is to use division in along division or using a calculator letme show you first examples of the firstmethod which sometimes works and that isfor example 7 over 25 I can write anequivalent fraction with a denominatorof 100 because 25 goes evenly to 100right 25 times 4 is 100 so 7 times 4goes here 28 and now of course we canwrite this as a decimal 28 hundreds is0.28 it's another such kind now 8 okaylet's say that I wrote here so manytenths 8 does not go evenly in the 10nor in 200 but it does go evenly intoone thousand eight times 125 equals 1000so I go 3 times 125 that's 375 and nowthat is of course three hundredseventy-five thousandths we can write itas a decimal 0.375 but most fractionsare not this kindfor most fractions we need to use thesecond method we need to divide and I'mgonna even here show you two basic casesthe first case being that the decimalwill end and let's say I have elevensixteenths I'm gonna write this as adecimal and I'm going to use longdivision notice that we're gonna divide11 by 16 and of course 16 does not gointo 11this is what we will do we will write 11as a decimal number put lots of decimalzeros here and then divide and I alsowrote the multiplication table of 16here the side to help me okay so 16 goesto 110 times so 0 here and then my decimalpoint will come right at the same placeand now I look at 110 16 goes to 110 sixtimes and 6 times 16 is 96 you need tobe careful with lining all your numbersthen 110 minus 96 is 14 then drop 0 andthen how many times does 16 go into 140over here we see it's 8 times 1/8 times16 is 128 now subtract and we will get12 then drop a 0 and 16 how many timesdoes it go into 120 that's now 7 timesand we get 112 subtract 8 and droppedanother 0 and now it goes evenly 5 timesokay I get 0 here as a remainder so mydivision ends right hereand the decimal ends okay so this is myanswer zero point 6 8 7 5 now we'regoing to look at the case where thedecimal actually does not end and ifyou've never seen it before it's kind offascinatingthis time the decimal we get is unendingit's also going to be repeating some ofits digits are going to repeat 7 11th asa decimal okay I will divide 7/11 sonotice again 7 goes inside this cornerand eleven here is the divisor and wewill put lots of decimal zeros here andthen start dividing 11 goes into sevenzero times then look at seven to here11 goes into 70 6 times 6 times 11 66then 4 and we drop a zero 11 goes into40 3 times 3 times 11 33 subtract 7 thenanother zero 7 thing just like how Istarted 11 goes into 70 6 times I get 66and four drop to zero 11 goes into 40three times I get 33 subtract 7 drop iszero now you notice that it startsrepeating here okay I get 14 33 1766those same numbers for 233 1766 andthese are repeating here 2 6-3 6-3 now Iknow it's going to go 6-3 6-3 it's gonnarepeat the 6-3 and it's never gonna endI can see that here too because it keepsrepeating the same remainders it's nevergonna give me a remainder of 0 okaythe way to write this here as a decimalis either this way like I have it herewith 3 dots showing that it repeats orlike this 0.63 and then draw a bar abovethose repeating digits let's try anotherone2 divided by 15 to 15 okay again noticethat to the smaller number goes here and15 outsideokay 15 goes into 2-0 times as expectedand 15 goes into 20 one time one time 15subtract we get five and then 50 15 goesinto 50 three times we get forty fivesubtract five drop Azir 15 goes intofifty three times okay I see now I'm notgonna get anywhere I'm just gonna getthis five always and then 50 and threehere okay it is repeating I always getfive as my remainder and these three ishere keep repeating but notice there wasthis digit here one that it's notrepeated it's only repeating the threesso when I write it here I can write itthis way zero point one three and Iwrite this bar above three because threerepeats but one does not now that youhave seen decimals that are unending andrepeating sometimes I need to tell youthis sometimes the repeating part maybefive or six or seven or 14 digits aloneand so if you're using a calculator youmay actually not see it repeat in whichcase you may need to just round youranswer and now that you've seen theseunending the symbols that repeat thequestion then arises would there be anydecimals that are unending and thatdon't repeat the answer is yes they doexist such numbers such numbers are notfractions okay in other words they arenot rational numbers rational numbersare fractions and these new kind ofnumbers are irrational numbers oneexample of such number that you knowabout is number pi if we write pi as adecimalit is unending but there's never arepetition of a certain sequence ofdigits okay so it's kind of afascinating topiclastly we're gonna look at a little bitof a fun pattern okay I'm gonna writeone xi as a decimal and then from thatcan you guess these others 1 xi I justhave to divide once again 1/11 let's see11 goes to 10 0 times and 11 goes to 109times then we get 99 here and one dropis 011 goes into 10 zero times so I dropanother zero and then it goes intohundred nine times 99 well I see it'sgonna repeat now I have to again put 0here it cost zero times tapenade zeroand it cost nine times okay over herethis is zero point zero nine in therepeating part is zero nine when I guesswhat this one will be let me see if Ican do that toorunning out of space but 2/11okay 11 goes into 20 one time and thenwe get eleven subtract 98 times 88 2 andthen twenty one time eleven subtract 90and eight okay so the repeating parthere is zero point one eight one eightrepeats now I'm gonna leave it up to youto check these two if you can guess whatkind of repeating Part A we are donewith this
