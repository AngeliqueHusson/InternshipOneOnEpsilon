equivalent and simplified fraction okaynow underneath you I'd like you to drawa little diagram for me okayum how should we make it yeah okay drawfor me a little square that's aredivided up into four rows and fourcolumns like thisfour rows and four columnsokay draw that alright now this is whatI used to illustrate the fact that whenwe talk about fractions right there'slots of different ways to say the samething not just fractions and percentagesand decimals but even differentfractions that mean the same thing theyare equivalent okay now there's yourlittle box there okay I want you shadehalf of it for me like so if you haveanother card that would be helpful andprobably make it a little computer okaynow hopefully you joining us a littlemore accurately than mine and yoursixteen squares are all about the samesize okay now I ask you to shade half ofit right a half okay but how manysquares did you shade like the littlesquareshmm there are eight right are two foursix eight so that means this fraction isthe same as eight out of how many littlesquares are there in total you said 60all right okay all right the other oneso you can see here right how do I getthis the numerator in the denominator ifI multiply them by the same numbermultiplied by eight on the top and eighton the bottom they're all same okay soyou can see they're kind of I canmultiply by any number I like so long asI do it to the top and the bottom andthese fractions are going to be the samethey'll all be equivalent so give me anumberyou just another not to me so that I cando in my head hey I'm just going to dofive I do I can't I can't do 56 in myhead of what today eight times five youguys made your times tables that's funnybuddy isn't itforty okay sixteen times five that's aand just as you'd expect 40 over eightywould be still like so that'll bedividing up these squares into smallerpieces but it's still the same fractionokay so all of these they're all I don'tdo this like minds like informationpractice these are all equivalentfractions they're all equivalent but oneand only one of these factions is thesimplified fraction the simplest one orreduced to its simplest form which oneis ityeah it's one over two now or what makesthat one what makes 1/2 1 over 2 whatmakes it the sin fost1 over 2 I can't make these numbers anysmaller40 over 80 I can reduce those stuff thesame fraction 8 over 16 I can keep goingwhatever to though I can't they're anice whole number smaller than one otherso I'm kind of stuck this is as far as Ican gothis guy here is the simplest or asimplified fraction
