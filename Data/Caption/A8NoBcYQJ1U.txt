all means same terminal means where itterminates her stops so if you thinkabout you want to find an angle thatstops or terminates in the same placethat's 30 degrees 30 degrees is rightthere if you add 360 degrees you'regonna end up in the same spot if yousubtract 360 degrees you're gonna end upin the same spot so what you can do isjust add 360 that's going to be 390degrees390 degrees or you can subtract 360 andthat's gonna give you a negative 330degrees either way you're still going toend up in the same spot on the unitcirclesame thing with radians if you take yourangle and you add 2 pi you're gonna begoing all the way around and you'regonna have the same spot or if yousubtract 2 pi you're gonna be going thisdirection you're gonna end up in thesame location so that's how you findcoterminal angles sometimes they'll giveyou a problem like find one positivecoterminal angle and one negativecoterminal angle with 700 degrees youmay have to subtract 360 multiple timesuntil you get into an angle that'snegative so here we might have tosubtract 360 twice so that's negativeseven twenty so that would give younegative twenty degrees okay if you add360 that would give you a positivecoterminal angle that would be sevenhundred plus 360 which is a thousand 60so by adding 360 subtracting 360 oradding two pi or subtracting 2 pi you'llend up in the same point on the unitcircle so this has been just an overviewof how to find coterminal angles I'llsee you in the next video
