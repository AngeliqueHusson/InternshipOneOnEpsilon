what's up everyone and welcome to thisshort lesson where we are going tocompare the side angle side and angleside angle triangle congruence theoremso we're going to start off with a quickrecap of the side-angle-side theoremthis theorem states that have twotriangles have a set of congruent sidesalong with a congruent angle and anotherset of congruent sides where that angleis in between those two congruent sidesand when this is the case we have enoughinformation to say that these twotriangles are congruentnow we can look at angle-side-angle thistheorem says that if we have twotriangles with a set of congruent anglesalong with a congruent side and anothercongruent angle this time such that theside is in between the two congruentangles we have enough information to saythat the two triangles are congruentso now we can visually compare these twotheorems to help us to better understandthem and ultimately choose the right oneso side-angle-side involves twocongruent sides with an angle in betweenthemand angle-side-angle involves twocongruent angles with a side in betweenthem so just be sure to keep thesedifferences in mind so that when you arelooking at congruent triangles and usingtheorems that you use the appropriateones based on the information that youhave haha cool thank you so much guysfor checking us out please subscribe toour YouTube channel for more freeanimated math lessons updated every week
