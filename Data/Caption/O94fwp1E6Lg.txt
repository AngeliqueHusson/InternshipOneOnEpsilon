here's a quadrilateral how do we findthe sum of angles of this quadrilaterallet's name the quadrilateral first let'scall it a b c d we have to find the sumof angles of the quadrilateral ABCD it'ssimple the sum of angles is the measureof angle A plus angle B plus angle Cplus angle D yes that's correct but wehaven't been given any of the measuresnow what what do we do nextsince we are familiar with triangles letus break the figure into two triangleslet's join points a and C like this butwait how does this help us let's try towrite the sum in a different way angle awill be the sum of these two angles itmeans angle a can be written as angle DAC plus angle C a be angle B is notsplit so we write it as this angle Cwill equal the sum of these two anglesit can be written as angle BCA plusangle ACD the angle D is written as isdo you think we're getting closer to theanswer yes you can now see that we canjoin the angles of each triangletogether these three angles belong tothis triangle and these three belong tothis one we can write the first group asangle DAC plus angle ACB plus angle D itis the sum of the angles of triangle ACDand the second group can be written asangle BCA plus angle B plus angle C a Band since the sum of interior angles ofa triangle is 180 degrees thisexpression will equal 180 degrees andthis expression as well will equal 180degrees the sum equals 360 degrees sothe sum of interior angleof a quadrilateral equals 360 degreesyou
