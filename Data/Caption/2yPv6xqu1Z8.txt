hey everyone welcome back to mashup mathAnthony here thank you for joining me onthis lesson we are going to exploreright rectangular prisms how to findtheir volume and what to do whenfractions are involved you ready heyguys welcome back we're gonna start offthis lesson on finding the volume ofright rectangular prisms which is ashape that we're all familiar with whenwe get those Amazon packages in the mailthat box is a right rectangular prismand we are going to think about thesekinds of figures in terms of theirvolume now the volume of a rectangularprism is going to be dependent on itsdimensions in other words its length itswidth and its height so for examplelet's consider a rectangular prism witha length of 10 inches a width of 4inches and a height of 7 inches now weshould have a basic understanding thatthe volume of the figure is a measure ofthe amount of space inside of thatfigure or how much it can hold insidenow you may also know that in geometrywe express volume in cubic units so inother words the volume represents thenumber of unit cubes it would take tofill the entire prism and since thelength width and height of the prismshown is measured in inches our unitcube will have a length of 1 inch awidth of 1 inch and a height of 1 inchso if we were to take our rectangularprism and completely fill it from bottomto top with these one inch unit cubesand then count the total number of cubesthat final total would represent thevolume of the figure now counting everysingle one of these cubes would take avery long time and is not the mostefficient way to find volume luckily ourtank of the prisms have certainproperties that allow us to applygeneral rules for finding volume and weare going to explore those rules now solet's imagine that we only use those oneinch unit cubes to fill the bottom layerof this rectangular prismto fill this bottom layer we would needten cubes along the length and 4 cubesalong the width so basically we wouldhave four rows of ten one inch unitcubes so to figure out the total numberof 1-inch unit cubes to cover thisbottom layer we can just multiply tentimes four and our product is 40 so wehave 40 cubes comprising this bottomlayer of the rectangular prism now todetermine how many of these 40 cubelayers it would take to fill the entireprism we have to look at the heightwhich is 7 inches which means that wewould need seven layers of 40 cubes soby multiplying 40 times 7 our product of280 represents the total number of unitcubes it would take to fill this entireprism so now we can conclude that theprism has a volume of 281 inch cubes or280 cubic inches so now let's go back tothinking about some of those generalrules that apply to finding the volumeof a rectangular prism so in that lastexample we found volume by firstfiguring out the number of cubes in thebase layer and then multiplying thatvalue by 7 which represented the heightof the figure now to find that number ofcubes in the base layer we found thearea of the base in this case the lengthtimes the width or 4 times 10 andmultiply that by 7 now 7 againrepresented the height so we canconclude that we can define the volumeof a rectangular prism by multiplyingthe area of the base by the height ha hacool and thinking about volume in thisway should help us to better understandthe more familiar formula defining thevolume of a rectangular prism which islength times width times heightso in this case that leatherby that baserepresents the length times the width sonow moving forward understand that youcan use either formula for determiningthe volume of a rectangular prism so nowlet's go ahead and try another exampleof finding the volume of a rectangularprism now in this case our units arecentimeters so we want to figure out howmany one centimetre unit cubes it wouldtake to fill this figure from bottom totop so let's go ahead and use the volumeequals length times width times heightapproach so in this example the lengthand width are represented by sevencentimeters and two centimeters and theheight is represented by fivecentimeters so our next step is tosubstitute these values into theequation and then multiply now theproduct of the length and the width 7and 2 is just 14 which represents thearea of the base multiplied by theheight of 5 and our product representsour volume which is 71 centimeter cubesand again we can visualize this as fiveof those 7 by 2 base layers stacked upfrom bottom to top so now let's take ourunderstanding of volume to the nextlevel for example what if instead ofexpressing volume in one centimeter unitcubes we wanted to express it in 1/2centimeter unit cubes now since this isa smaller unit we should see that it'sgoing to take several more of thesesmaller 1/2 centimeter unit cubes tofill the entire rectangular prism nowsince the dimensions are half the sizewe have to divide the length the widthand the height by two now what this doesis it doubles the amount of cubes on thelength from 7 to 14 it doubles theamount of cubes in the width from 2 to 4and it doubles the amount of cubes inthe height from 5 to 10 now be sure tounderstand that the volume of the figurehas not changed that is the amount ofspace inside of this rectangular figureis still the samehowever since we are now using smalleryoucubes to fill the inside of the spaceour volume will be represented by alarger number however the unit will besmaller so to find the volume of thefigure now in terms of 1/2 inch unitcubes we use the same approach and thatis using the formula volume equalslength times width times height so bysubstituting 14 and 4 in for the lengthand the width and substituting 10 in forthe height all we have to do is multiplyin this case 14 times 4 the area of thebase is 56 multiplied by 10 is 560 sothe volume of the figure expressed in1/2 centimeter cubes is 560so now let's go ahead and take one lastlook at the difference between the twodifferent units of measurement that weuse to express the volume of thatrectangular prism so again we use onecentimeter cubes and 1/2 centimetercubes so in terms of one centimetercubes the figures volume was 70 and interms of 1/2 centimeter cubes thefigures volume was 560 so by comparisonwe should see that a one centimeter cubeis the equivalent of 8 1/2 centimetercubes so when we compare our volumes ourone centimeter volume was 70 and if wemultiply 70 by 8 our result is 560 hahacoolso by visualizing this relationship weshould be able to better understand howwe express the volume of a figure andhow that volume is dependent on the unitthat we choose to useso now let's go ahead and take on onefinal example where we want to find howmany 1/4 inch cubes will fit inside ofthe prism shown now notice that thisprism has what's called fractional edgesthat means that the dimensions of thelength the width and the height aremixed numbers and include fractions soin this case our unit cubes areone-fourth or one-quarter inch in sizeso we can imagine a one-inch cube a 1/2inch cube and of course a 1/4 inch cubewhich will be very small so our volumewill be represented by a much largernumber than if we had used a 1 inch cueokay so even though two of ourdimensions include fractions where youstill use the same approach to findingvolume and that is the length timeswidth times height formula so firstlet's look at the length of the figurewhich is one and a half inches we canthink of this as a one inch unit cubealongside half of a one inch unit cubeand our next question should be whatwould be the equivalent in one quarterinch unit cubes now we can think aboutthis in terms of money a quarter inchunit cube would be like a quarter andthat one and a half inch measurementwould be like a dollar and fifty centsone and a half or six quarters so now wecan replace that measurement of 1 and1/2 inches with 6 one quarter inch cubesso in the case of 1/4 inch cubes ourlength is 6now since our width is one-inch we knowthat it would take for 1/4 inch cubes tocover that with so we can say that ourwidth in terms of quarter-inch cubes is4 and we can apply this same thoughtprocess to the height which is 3 and 3/4of an inch which would be equivalent to15 1/4 inch cubes so we can replace ourheight with 15 and now to find thevolume all we have to do is multiply 6times 4 which is 24 multiplied by 15results in our volume so we can concludethat it would take 361 quarter-inchcubes to fill the entire prism so justkeep these strategies and concepts inmind as you continue to explore theproperties of right rectangular prismsespecially in terms of their volume andthat is all for this lesson thank youagain so much everyone and we'll catchyou all next time all right so thatlesson is over I hope you found ithelpful and I want to thank you allagain
