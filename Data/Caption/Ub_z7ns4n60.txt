assume we have two lines P and Q on aplane and transversal are that cutsthrough them this topic of transversalsgets very interesting when we studiedthe angles that are formed by thetransversal with the two lines but thequestion is how many angles are formedlet's count them firstlet's count the angles made by thetransversal with the line P one twothree and four so four angles with thefirst line and then with the second linefive six seven and eight that's it eightangles in all as we can see there arefour angles that are formed between thelines P and Q in this region anglesthree four five and six as they'rebetween the two lines they are calledthe interior angles and similarly thereare four angles outside the regionbetween the two linesangles 1 2 7 and 8 these angles arecalled exterior angles as they lieoutside the region what's so specialabout these angles when the lines P andQ are parallel each of these angles willhave a special relation with each ofthese eight angles we will see that inthe coming videos
