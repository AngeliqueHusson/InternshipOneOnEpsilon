welcome I remember in my high schooldays my teacher riding in the back ofthe Princeton formulas we had tomemorize though basically aboutexpanding terms of the form x + y sesquared I think most people know this isx squared plus 2xy the cross terms plusy squared but we also have to memorizeas kids back in my dayformer 4x plus y cubed that turns it beX cubed plus 3x squared y plus 3xysquared plus y cubed and also X plus yto the fourthwhy are you memorize these things I donot really know but it has to be x tothe 4th plus 4x cubed y plus 6x squaredY squared + 4 X Y cubed plus y to thefourth I'm gonna keep going thisdirection if I go backwardsX plus y to the one that's actually justX plus y and you can go back a littlefurtherX plus y to the zeroth there'll be onebut there's something curious here ifyou look at the numbers that appear ascoefficients and the very first term isa 1 and then on the second row or thespecial maybe I should call this the onethrow so obviously the Assoc with thenumber one I have two ones it's reallyone times x + 1 times y on the secondrow I have one times x squared - 1 onthe third row I have 1 3 3 1 then on thefourth row 1 4 6 4 1 and if I writethese coefficients as a littletriangular tableau I obtain thissequence of numbers array of numberswhich people recognize as a Pascal'striangle so the binomial theorembasically says that if you take a littlebinomial suppose that's what a binomialsum you know what these highschool termsare that's about a mile race the nthpower basically you get a whole sequenceof terms that correspond to the nth rowof Pascal's triangleah actually this is kind of interestingif you looked at the video on a formulafor Pascal's triangle which you know aformula for each of these numbers soactually I could actually write out thereal formula for that I just haveactually twice in the same sentence it'spretty strange all right let me explainwhy does expanding a binomial have anyconnection in the past guess trying onthe firstthat's often a mystery for people it'sactually not difficult to kind of funlet's do it alright let me just clearthe scene here to dr. Danlet's get rid of all this drinky drinkyjust stuff can go away and let's go forsomething really grimy and look at Xplus y to the fifth power the binomialtheorem says it's basically going to bethis fifth row of Pascal's triangleremember I'm calling that the zeroth rowat the top all right let me be reallytedious this is X plus y times X plus ytimes X plus y times X plus y times Xplus y all right how do I expandbrackets but what I need to do is chooseone term from each centered parenthesesand multiply them all together and thenadd up all possible combinations andthen ask myself will I get an X to thefifth term and the answer is yeah surethey all come from choosing X and thenchoosing X and choosing X and choosing Xand choosing X in fact that's the onlyway and get X to the fifth so there'sonly one X to the fifth term now I canask myself will there be any X to thefourth times y terms well the answer isyes I could get that by choosing X and Xand X and X and then Y from there that'sfine but actually I can get other waysas well okay so I'll go to xx x and y soit's multiplication is commutative thisterm could also rise from going X X X YX choose the X choose the X choose the Xnow choose the Y from this lot same tolast one and then choose the X or youget from choosing X X Y X X or X Y X X Xor Y X X X X now that I can see that'sthe only five ways I can do that soactually this is my pair 5 x and lo andbehold look at that's the second entryof the fifth row ah let me keep goinghow many ways will I get X cubed Ysquared now things are getting a littlebit tedious for me the question isreally the same as asking how many wayscould arrange three X's and two y's nowI have to draw upon some other videoshere take me way over ten minutes toexplain everything in one video but ifyou go to the video on why is zerofactorial equal to one where she answerthatthe answer is number of letters you havemade factorial by factorial divided bythe number of X's we have threefactorial the Father number wise as hehad two factorial so there is the numberthat actually must go in front of the Xcubed Y squared term now what is thatnumber will you actually work it outfive times four times three times twotimes one on the top line divided bythree times two times one divided by twotimes one that does turn out to be tenbut here's the next thing I need us togo to the formula for the Pascal'striangle video because in that video welearn that the entries on the end throwon your different color pen if you're onthe anthro of the triangle to work outthe entries on the anthro where we gosay a places in from the left and Bplaces in from the right this is thatentry at that position for example letme count let me look at this this number10 accorded the Pascal's triangle videothis is the number on the fifth Roy saidthat and count the number of places infrom the left but there's somethingweird going on with always standingaccounts a zero it turns out 0 1 2places in from the left hand presses infrom the right zero one two three placesin from the right and voilathat is indeed this entry of Pascal'striangle little mismatch my denominatorbut this is mob vacations communitiveI'm actually fine so this number thatarises from raising three X's and twoy's is indeed the next entry in the rowof Pascal's triangleso they're actually indeed ten ways todo X cubed Y squared same sort of work xsquared Y cubed how many ways to arrangefive letters to them being X's three ofthem being Weiser's well that's the nextrow come in 0 1 2 3 places 0 1 2 placesthat's it that is going to be 10 X Y tothe fourth that's going to be 5factorial over 1 factorial 4 factorialwhich isn't either next entry of thefifth row another 5 plus y to the 4thbeautiful so yes indeed the fifth row ofPascal's triangle is matching expandingX plus y to the fifth powernow let's have fun with this most peopleforget that in algebra X&Y can actuallybe numbers and what I'm gonna do is havesome fun with that so I choose right nowto let whoops need a pen that x equals 1y equals 1 so what's that telling mewell this guy would be 1 plus 1 to thefifth power that's 2 to the fifthit would have to equal go into thisformula 1 to the fifth that X to thefifth plus 5 times 1 to the fourth times1 that's just 5 times 1 that's 5 plus 10times 1 cubed Y squared that's just 10plus 10 times 1 squared Y Q that's just10 plus 5 times 1 times 1 to the fourththat's just 5 plus our Y to the fourth 1to the fourth that's just don't 1 Ishould be 1/5 by the way was to me mesorry about thatah but that's to me the entries in thefifth row of Pascal's triangle add up tothe fifth power to bet there's nothingspecial about the fifth row here we'vebasically proven the binomial theoremshows that the entries of any row ofPascal's triangle add up to the power 2power being that for a number all rightthat was just from choosing x equals 1 yequals 1 let's discover other thingswell if I put in x equals 1 y equalsnegative 1 well that's going to tell methat X plus y to the fifth that's gonnabe 1 plus negative 1 to the 5th 0 equalsokay here goes X to the fifth would be 1to the fifth one five times X to thefourth times y 1 to the fourth timesnegative 1 that's minus 5 10 times Xcubed Y squared make them 1 squared ispositive so this is now positive plus 10minus 10 plus 5 minus 1 is 0 so that'stelling me the alternating sum of anyrow of Pascal's triangle is sure to be 0a lot of people notice this by geometrybut you should prove that the binomialtheorem as well the one that freaks alot of people out is our powers of 11 Ineed some more room to return to them okvery messy screen this time sorry aboutthatlet's look at this have you ever noticedif you take the number 11 and square ityou get hundred 21 the number 11 - themonth powers just 11 and 11 to thezeroth power is just 1 11 cubed if youwork it out it happens to be 1 3 3 1 and11 to the 4 think checking my calculatorhappens to be 1 4 6 4 1 mm-hmm theseanswers look like Pascal's triangle wellwhy is thatnow the binomial theorem makesabsolutely clear let's look at thefourth one X plus y to the fourthaccording the binomial theorem is thefourth power as the fourth row ofPascal's triangle X to the fourth plusfour executes y plus six x squared Ysquared plus four X Y cubed plus y tothe fourthI choose x equals 10 y equals 11 for thefun of it it might was one on a sayingthen X plus y would be 11 so I'm saying11 to the fourth would be he goes thisnumber 10 to the fourth power rightthat's 10,000 plus this number 4 x cubedis a thousand times 1 so that's 4,000semanek 4,000 to that plus six times ahundred times 1 600 plus 4 times 10times 140 plus one that is clearly onefour six four one yes it has to be thefourth where Pascal's triangle becauseI'm doing powers of 10 and these are thedigits that appear in the in thebinomial theorem all right one can pushthis little bit further I suggest aslittle optional homework for you look at11 to the fifth and 11 to the sixth isthis result still working in some senseand what sense does it still work or wasit just out the window now you couldargue the theorem stoolI'm fine in fact here's my true myultimate homework start choosing crazynumbers for X&Y what if I put x equals 2and y equals negative 1sure that's telling me some mysteriousproperty of Pascal's triangle you'venever thought of before or put x equals10 and y equals 9 Discover's talkingabout powers of 9 being hidden Pascal'striangle there's lots of fun to be hadso go for itall right thanks very much
