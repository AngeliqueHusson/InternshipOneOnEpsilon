welcome a common unit in an algebra 2course or maybe a precalculus course isthe idea fitting exponential functionsto data that is the gift problems thefollowing type are supposed to give adata or say a population size of someculture of yeast or something so at timeT it has a population P of T and maybeon day three in the culture is weighs 8grams and on day 7 it weighs 13 grams orsomething and there are students to finda formula of the form P is age and B tosome power system power T that fits thisdata because they are talk about agrowth being basically an exponentialmodel or some kind so we have to findphotos a and B for which these valueswork all right well in a way they makekids do is just plug and chug let's putin 20 years 3 the populations 8 so 8equals a times b cubed and went to you 7populations 13 so 13 equals a times B tothe seventh and solve these twoequations and you know the insight forkids actually if you divide the 2equations you'll get that 13 over 8 is adivided by a and B to the seventhdivided by B cubed has been at fourth soto leave over that B is the charmingnumber 13 8 to the 1/4 power and knowingthat I kiss you can shove that back intothis formula and work out a horrendousvalue for a and I guess you're done andhas some that looks completely ugly butactually there's a very easy way to fitexpansion functions to data of twopoints it's better just to write it downand to leave how you just see what towrite I let me make the data set alittle bit simpler first so let's do Tpopulation P and suppose the times a day0 is 8 and day 1 is 13 so 2,000 myinitial populations 8 grams and over oneday it goes up by a factor of 13 eighthsit's very easy to be performing thatdoes that trick P equals 8 times 13 8 tothe T and check if I write put 2 equals0 I'm left with P equals 8 times 0 8 yaybut T equals 1 I'm left with P equals 8times 13 over 8 which is 13 that does itso if the initial time values are verystraightforward it's very easy just towrite down an answer all right let's goup an oxidation difficulty here's time Tlet's suppose the same two out of eightand thirteen but I'd slow it down by afactor of four suppose it takes fourdays for my culture to reach 30 grams soit means I need to modify this formulahere and make four time of four behavelike onewell it's easy to write down eight timesthirteen over eight T over four andcheck again put put two equals zero yetP equals eight times thirteen to thezero 13 X at zero does the trick it'seight and puts it equals four and I getfour or four yet there is making behavelike one so I get eight times 1308 it's13 well now we'll just sit let's go tothe original data set let's get back tomy own same color pen tp3and 7/8 into 13 it's better at theprevious exampleI've got slowed down by a factor of byfactor 4 but now I want 3 to behave likezero so they're going to modify thisformula in such a way that T equals 3 isbehaving like zero well it's easy Pequals 8 13 over 8 t minus 3 over 4 willdo the trick because check put in Tequals 3 I'm getting 8 times 13 8 0 yep8 again whoops via 8 and put 2 equals 77 minus 3 is 4 over 4 is 1 so I'mgetting agents that in aces & 1 I'mgetting 30 and again so there it is andAshley is good exercise do the work it'shard way and see it really actually isthe same arts as this it looks ugly overhere but turns out algebraically thesame guy let's practice a couple onemore examplethe technique is kind of fun once youget the hang of it it's pretty easy it'sactually great I think pedagogically forkids just step back and find perspectiveon numbers and you know one greatchannel mathematics is reduce everythingto an easier problem and just see thatit really is an easier problem indisguise and for example suppose I gaveyou the data set X Y oopslike I don't know 9 18 20 and 5 find anexponential graph a formula that fitsthat data okay well I want to T equals 9to behave like zero and what things tobe slowed down by a factor of 11 heregoesy must be initial values 18 things arechanging by a factor of fiveeighteenth's I want to be on nine tobehave like zero and or even to beslowed down by a factor of 11voila so I'll leave this this video witha couple of exercises for you these arejust fun ones I'm you know I'm a teachermake you practice easier ones that mostanimals first but he's making unusualstuff as I told you fit an exponentialfunction to the data 83 is 42 and 199 isalso 42 what happens in that case orsuppose I asked you fit an exponentialfunction to the data I know17 is 86 and 23 is zero what happens inthat case try to play with itsomething something fun happens alrightthere's there's a basic unit of algebrastudents special precalculus in anutshell thanks very much
