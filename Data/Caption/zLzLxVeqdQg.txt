Famously start with eraise to Pi with an ithen we're taught by a lotthat you've gotminus 1Can we glean what it means?For such words are absurdHow to treat the repeat of a featPi I timesThis is bound to confound'til your mind redefinesthese amounts one can't countwhich surmount our friend e.Numbers act as abstractfunctions which slide the rich2d space in its space with a gracewhen they sum.Multiplied, they don't slide,acting a second wayThey rotate, and dilate, but keep straightthat same plane.Now that we write as eto the x won't perplexwhen you know it's for showthat 'x' goes up and right.It does not, as you thought,repeat e product e.It functions with gumption on functionswe've now seen.It turns slides side to sideinto growths and shrinks both.Up and downs come aroundas turns round which is key!This is why Pi times i,which slides north is brought forthand returned, we have learned,as a turn halfway round.Minus one, matched by none.Turns this way hence we're done.
