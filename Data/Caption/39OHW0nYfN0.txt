to find the circumference of the circleshown we use the formula circumferenceequals two times pi times the radius orc equals two pi r in this problemhowever notice that we're given thediameter instead of the radius to findthe radius remember that the radius of acircle is equal to half of the diameterso the radius of the circle shown isequal to half of 14 centimeters or sevencentimeters now to find thecircumference we plug seven centimetersin for the radius in our formula and wehave two times pi times sevencentimeters which simplifies to 14 picentimeters so one way to write thecircumference of the circle shown is 14pi centimeters next remember that pi isapproximately equal to 22 sevenths or3.14 so we can plug 3.14 in for pi andwe have 14 times 3.14 centimeters whichsimplifies to 43 point nine sixcentimeters so another way to write thecircumference of the circle shown is 43point nine six centimeters
