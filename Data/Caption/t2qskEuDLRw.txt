let's say I tell you you have ten sidedfigure and it's equiangular what's goingto be the measure of one of those angleswell to find that out first we have toback up there's two key termsequiangular and regular that are goingto apply to what we're talking abouthere first one is equal angle er whichmeans all the angles in the polygon arecongruent it doesn't have anything to dowith the sides it just means the anglesand you could remind yourself of thatbecause it looks like we have the wordangle here regular combines equilateraland equiangular it says that all anglesand all sides must be congruent to eachother so we look at these two polygonsright here we have two Pentagon's onlyone of these are equiangular well herewe have all sides marked as congruent sothis is not equal angular if we look atthis Pentagon right here all of yourangles are marked as congruent to eachother so yesthis one would be equal angle er if youput these together you have a regularpolygon which is like this hexagon righthere notice that all the sides arecongruent to each other and all theangles are congruent to each other buthow do we calculate the measure of oneof those angles well to do that we needto look at our polygon angle sum we saidthat the sum of the angles in a polygonis equal to n minus 2 times 180 to findthat we said how many triangles can wedraw in a polygon and that was alwaysthe number of sides minus two the sum ofthe angles in the triangle is 180 so ifyou want to find just one angle in aregular polygon you're gonna take thisformula which is the quantity of n minus2 times 180 and since all the angles arethe same you can just divide by thenumber of angles that you have so you'retaking this formula and you're dividingby the number of sides that you have inyour equiangular polygon or in yourregular polygon
