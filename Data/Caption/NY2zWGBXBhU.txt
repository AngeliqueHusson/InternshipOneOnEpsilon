okay so welcome to my video on Z scoresand Z scores are just another way ofexpressing average and standarddeviation if you have a z-score of onethat just means that your one standarddeviation above the average or if youhave a z-score of negative one thatmeans that you that you are one standarddeviation below the average so let medraw this for you on the normal curveand I think it'll make a little bit moresense if you remember from my last videowe always put the average in the middleof the normal curve and this Greekletter mu represents the average and theaverage always has a z-score of zero soif I draw the z-score on the normalcurve I'm going to put the number zerowhere the average is supposed to beright in the middle and the distance ofthe average to one standard deviationabove the average is going to have az-score of positive one so I'm going toput a positive one one standarddeviation above the average and thedistance of two standard deviationsabove the average is going to have az-score of two so I'm going to draw apositive two which represents twostandard deviations above the averageand the same concept applies to the leftexcept we use negative numbers so onestandard deviation to the left of theaverage is going to be a negative one zscore and two standard deviations belowthe average is going to have a negativetwo z score and if you remember from myprevious video we know from theempirical rule that 68% of the data lieswithin one standard deviation and thesame concept applies for z-scoreswe know that 68% of the data or 68% ofthe area under the curve is in betweenthe z-scores negative one and positiveone the empirical rule also tells usthat 95% of thearea under the curve is in between twostandard deviations and once again thesame thing applies for z-scores 95% ofthe data or the area under the curve isin between these z-scores negative twoand positive two so many of you haveprobably noticed that z-scores are justanother way of expressing standarddeviation and are wondering why do weeven need to use z-scores in the firstplace and z-scores are particularlyuseful because you can find the area forany number under the curve let's saythat were somewhere between 1 & 2 let'ssay that we're 1.5 standard deviationsaway from the average so we draw a lineand this number is 1.5 so we are 1.5standard deviations away from theaverage and and we can't use theempirical rule to find the area to theright or to the left of 1.5 so let's saywe needed to find the area above 1.5this is when z-scores are particularlyuseful because we can use AZ table tofind this area so hopefully this willmake a little bit more sense once we getstarted with an example so let's getstarted right awayokay so here we have an example that issomewhat similar to the example from mylast video and in this video we're goingto solve this using z-scores and it saysthat the the test scores for class arenormally distributed okayso that means that we could use ournormal curve and it gives us that theaverage which is the Greek letter mu isequal to 75 and the standard deviationwhich is de Greek letter Sigma is equalto 10 so the first thing I'm going to dois place my average on the normal curvethe average once again always goesdirectly in the middle of the normalcurve okay so now that we've placed ouraverage of 75 directly in the middle ofthe curve let's see what this problem isasking us it says what is theprobability that a studentor above a 60 so we need to find out ifwhat's the probability that a studentscored above a 60 so let's place thisvalue of 60 on our normal curve we knowthat our value of 60 is less than 75 sothat means that we have to to place thatvalue of 60 below the value of 75 so wecan place our value of 60 anywhere belowthe value of 75 so now if we want tofind the probability of a studentscoring above a 60 the only thing wehave to do is find the area above thevalue of 60 but the question is howexactly do we find that area and this iswhy we need to use our z-scores and sothe formula that we need to use to findthe Z value for any any point on thecurve is equal to 2 any value X minusthe average which is the Greek letter muall divided by the standard deviation sothis is the formula that you shouldmemorize so write this down this is theformula to find the z-score for anyvalue on the curve so let's find thez-score for our value of 60 the z-scoreis going to be equal to X which is ourvalue of 60 minus the average which is75 divided by our standard deviationwhich is equal to 10 so if we simplifythis we have 60 minus 75 over thenumerator which is negative 15 dividedby 10 negative 15 divided by 10 isnegative 1.5 so our our z-score for thevalue of 60 is equal to negative onepoint five so now I'm going to draw theZ value in blue below the value of 60now this value of 60 has a z-score ofnegative 1.5 so what that means thatthat this value of 60 is is 1.5 standarddeviationsbelow our average of 75 so now let'sfind the z-score or the Z value for theaverage of 75 the average always has az-score of zero every single time soright in the middle below our average weare going to write our z-score of zeroso now in order to solve this problem weneed to solve these areas under thecurve notice how we have three separatesections we have this this area to theleft of of 60 which I'll call section 1we have this area in between 60 and 75which I'll which I'll call section 2 orarea 2 and we have this this area to theright of 75 which I'll call section 3 orarea 3 so now we're going to find thearea of these three sections and we'regoing to use our z values to help uswith that so the first thing we're goingto do is we're going to find the area tothe left of our Z value of negative 1point 5 so in order to do this we needto use our Z table so let me show youwhat a Z table looks like I'm here wehave a Z table and you got to be carefulwhich which type of Z table you usebecause they're all a little bitdifferent in this particular one all theZ all the areas given to you are to theleft of the value of Z notice how inthis picture it shows you the area is tothe left of our Z value so I'll makesure that you that you know which typeof Z table that you're using so we needto find the area to the left of our Zvalue of negative 1.5 so if we go on theleft side of our table here we have avalue of negative 1.5 this is the areaof negative 1 point 5 0 if you go to theright this is the area of negative 1point 5 1 now and so on and so forththis is the area to the left of negative1 point 5 2 so we need to find the areato the left of negative 1 point 5 0which is this number right here point 06six-eight so we know that the area tothe left of negative one point five isequal to point zero six six eight or youcould say that this area is six pointsix eight percent of the area under thecurve alright so now let's take a lookat section three you can probably figurethis out just by looking at it we knowthat this is half of the curve becausethe average of 75 is directly in themiddle so we know that to the right ofthis 75 is half the curve so we knowthat this area of section three is equalto 50 percent of the curve all right sonow let me erase some stuff on the rightjust to give myself a little bit morespace alright so what do we know so farwe know that the area of section one issix point six eight percent of the totalarea under the curve we know that thearea of section three is equal to 250percent of the total area under thecurve and we don't know what what thearea of section two is at this point butwe do know that the total area under thecurve must equal 100 percentso if we add the area of section oneplus the area of section two in the areaof section three we add all thosetogether it has to equal 100% so we cansolve this equation for the area ofsection two just by subtracting area onein area three so the area of section twois equal to one hundred percent minusthe area of one which is six point sixeight percent minus the area of section3 which is fifty percent so we know thatthe area of section two is equal to 100minus six point six eight minus 50 whichis equal to forty three point three twopercent so now let's label this on ourcurve we know that this area of sectiontwo is forty three point three twopercent of the area under the curve soonce again in running out of space soI'm going to erase some stuff here onthe right okay so now we have everythingthat we need to know in order to solvethis problem the problem is asking uswhat is the probability that a studentscored above a sixty now so we need tofind the area above our value of sixtyso the probability that a random studentX scored greater than a sixty is equalto the area of section two plus the areaof section three those are the areasabove sixty well or another way we couldsay this is is the probability that ourZ value is greater than negative onepoint five is is equal to the area ofsection two plus the area of sectionthree these are two ways of saying theprobability that a student scored abovea sixty all right so let's plug in ournumbers our area of section two is fortythree point three two percent plus ourarea of Section three which is which isfifty percent so the probability that astudent scored above a sixty is fortythree point three two plus 50 which isequal to ninety three point three twopercent so I hope this gave you a betteridea of z-scores and how to use them tofind probability in my next video I'mgoing to talk about T scores it's notalways possible to use this method ofz-scores which I just taught you sosometimes we need to use another methodwhich we use T scores instead so staytuned for my next video I really hopeyou're enjoying these and I will see youlater
