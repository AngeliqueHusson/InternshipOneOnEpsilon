identify all acute obtuse and rightangles in the image below so let's justremind ourselves what what an acuteobtuse or right angle is an acute angleis an angle that is less than 90 degreesand I'll write it right over right underthe word acute a right angle a rightangle is an angle that is equal to 90degrees or whose measure is equal to 90degrees and an obtuse angle obtuse angleis an angle that is greater than 90degrees greater than 90 degrees and itis less than 180 degrees or you couldview it this way it is greater than 90degrees or 90 degrees is less than anobtuse angle and an obtuse angle is lessthan 180 degrees and they don't ask usabout this but if you have an angle thatis 180 degrees it forms a straight lineand that really is called a straightangle so let's look at this diagram andlet's start with the acute angles andI'll do I'll do the acute angles inpurple ones the ones that we know areless than 90 degreeswell you look over here the only realinformation they've given if they smarkthis box right over here that this angleright over here is a right angle soactually let's start with the rightangle because that actually might be alittle bit more interesting so they tellus that this right over here is a rightangle so we already know one of theright angles is angle Q a R where awould be the vertex you could also callit angle R a Q so angle QAR Q a are theyactually tell us the measure of that isactually 90 degrees now there is another90 degree angle here and that is Q 80this angle right over here angle Q a Tand the reason why I know that angle Q80 is also right is that if you take QAr if you take QA R which was this oneover here and combine it with QA t youactually form a straight angle you goall the way around like this and sotheir sum needs to be 180 degrees so ifQA r is 9agrees then qat also has to be 90degrees another way to think about it isso is because they are next to eachother they actually have an array incommon they are adjacent angles and ifyou were to put them and when you lookat if you look at their outer edges thatyou actually form a straight angle youwould call these two anglessupplementary or that they add up to 180degrees that's another definition ofsupplementary they add up to 180 degreestherefore if one is 90 the other one hasto be 90 degrees so with that out of theway now let's look at the now let's lookat the acute angles because thatactually gives us a lot of informationbecause of this entire angle if qat ifqat is 90 degrees then any of the anglesthat it's that make up qat have to beless than 90 degrees so for example QA pthat angle right over there q AP themeasure of that angle has to be lessthan 90 degrees because it's part ofthis larger 90 degree angle you'd haveto add that to this angle right overhere to actually get to 90 degrees soboth of them actually have to be lessthan 90 degrees so one acute angle isangle Q a P Q AP and then another acuteangle is angle P 80 angle P 80 and onceagain we know that because if we addthese two angles together you get 90degrees so each of them have to be lessthan 90 and we're assuming that neitherof these angles are zero degrees now arethere any other acute angles over herewell another angle that looks acute isangle Ras angle r.a.s and the reasonthat we can feel pretty good that it isless than 90 degrees is because if youwere to keep this line if you if a Q isjust a ray right now but if you wereextended all the way let's say you hadsome mythological point over therecalled X called X angle R ax would be 90degrees and so Ras is less than that soRas has to be less than 90 degrees and Ithink we got all of the acute all of theacute angles here we got the two rightangles here now let's think about theobtuse angle so ones that are more than90 degrees and180 degrees so one of the obtuse anglesone of the obtuse angles is if you wentfrom q.q a s or s AQ it was called SI qSI q is definitely an obtuse anglebecause it contains a 90 degree angle init and it's even wider than thatso si Q angle s a Q is definitely obtuseI'd be tempted to say SI p but SI p is astraight angle if we went all the wayaround like this 180 degrees that wouldactually be a straight angle and that'snot officially an obtuse angle andnotice it's called a straight anglebecause it forms a straight line the tworays the two edges of the angle form astraight line so we're not going toinclude we're not going to include si Ptherenow another obtuse angle another obtuseangle I'll do this in a different colorlooks like our AP angle our AP onceagain it contains our AQ in it which is90 degrees then it opens up even widerit opens up even wider than that andlet's see and our 80 is a straight angleso for our purposes we will not considerthat obtuse and have I found everythinghave I found everything am I not missingsomething so I did that one I did thatone and those would be straight anglesoh wait I just saw one more of courseyou also have this angle right over hereis a big blank spot and I wasn't payingattention to it you also have this angleright over here angle TAS angle TAS andthe reason why we know it's more than 90degrees is once again if you had thismythological point x over here that wasjust if you would continue if you wereto continue QA in this direction wewould know that this is a 90 degreeangle and TAS is opening up more thanthat 90 degree angle so TAS is also isalso obtuse and I think I got all ofthem now so let me see I think that isalthough yepwe're done
