let start segment that point point b right let set perpendicular bisector segment perpendicular split segment two thu could call line l that go perpendicular bisector go intersect angl bisect length length equal let call point right herem mayb want prove first video pick arbitrari point line perpendicular bisector b arbitrari point equal distant distanc point distanc point b let pick arbitrari point let call arbitrari point cand imagin like draw triangl let draw triangl draw line c anoth one c band essenti prove ca equal weve proven want prove c equal distanc b well there coupl interest thing see know equal b also know c equal obvious segment go equal know right angl also right angl line perpendicular bisector band two right triangl sand actual dont even worri theyr right look triangl c side congruent correspond side angl angl angl c correspond angl theyr degre theyr congruent side c that triangl sand congruent use congruenc write triangl congruent triangl congruenc congruent correspond side congruent c correspond two thing must congruent length must length right weve proven want prove arbitrari point c perpendicular bisector b equidist band could known drew c would made exact argument c that line that fair enough let write mean c equal let go way say find point equidist b sit perpendicular bisector let ill draw like b let throw point well call c let say c right mayb ill draw c right c go start assumpt c equidist b ca go equal go start go assumpt want prove perpendicular bisector weve drawn triangl weve done alway drop altitud side triangl right set line right draw like let drop altitud right although realli drop kind lift altitud case rotat around triangl loo ked like b c would realli drop altitud construct line right angl band let call point intersect prove c perpendicular bisector realli show c segment perpendicular bisector way weve alreadi perpendicular realli show bisect right two right right angl one way right angl know c go equal right angl leg hypotenus know r sh postul right angl one correspond leg that congruent correspond leg triangl hypotenus that congruent hypotenus two triangl congruent triangl congruent triangl theyr congruent correspond go congruent tell us must equal b theyr correspond side side right go congruent realli bisect ing line c realli perpendicular bisector whole reason interest thing perpendicular bisector sand point equidist point sand review found hey perpendicular bisector segment equidist segment went way point equidist segment perpendicular bisector segment let appli triangl let draw arbitrari triangl ill tri draw fairli larg let say that triangl give triangl that point point b point c could call triangl let construct perpendicular bisector segment go bisect distanc go equal distanc go perpendicular look someth like perpendicular actual let draw littl differ way drawn triangl make us get close special case actual talk next video let draw triangl littl bit one might littl bit better well see special case go go b go c let take point right mid point band draw perpendicular bisector perpendicular bisector might look someth like dont want make necessarili intersect c that necessarili go case go angl length equal length let thing segment c right take mid point roughli draw look like right let draw perpendicular bisector would look someth like length right equal length see intersect point fun let call point there interest point owe know sinc perpendicular bisector know distanc bi go distanc that prove first littl proof know go equal that kind neat also know intersect green perpendicular bisector yellow perpendicular bisector also know perpendicular bisector c equidist c know equal equal boa also equal c c thing well also know c must equal must equal point equidist two point either end segment point must sit perpendicular bisector segment that second proof right must sit perpendicular bisector draw perpendicular bisector right definit perpendicular bisector what neat simpl littl proof weve set video weve shown there uniqu point triangl equidist vertic triangl perpendicular bisector three side anoth way think weve shown perpendicular bisector three side intersect uniqu point equidist vertic uniqu point triangl special call circumcent equidist vertic distanc let color havent use distanc right equal distanc right equal distanc construct circl center whose radiu orang distanc whose radiu distanc well circl goe vertic triangl center circl would look best attempt draw weve right one weve shown construct someth like call thing circumcircl distanc right call circumradiu know construct there point center circl goe vertic triangl say circumscrib triangl say right circumcircl circl right circumscrib triangl mean three vertic lie circl everi point circumradiu away circumcent circumcent triangl special part triangl geometri khan academi circumcent triangl special part triangl geometri khan academi circumcent
