given triangl right angl vertex b measur angl degre c measur degre need prove prove side opposit degre half length hypotenus b c equal half c prove figur tell us anyth littl bit construct find way c b like b c equal b length equal length join ad like extend c b angl also degre construct interest length b c construct know b c equal mean b c half manag prove c equal done proof let look triangl triangl two triangl b c equal b base construct b c equal b equal angl degre b equal b common side side angl side therefor triangl congruent triangl congruenc condit correspond part congruent triangl alway congruent angl ad b equal angl correspond angl given degre angl also sixti degre angl ba also equal angl bac correspond angl angl bac given angl ba also equal thirti degre togeth form angl get measur angl sixti degre snow look triangl ad c equal sixti degre say triangl ad c equilater side equilater triangl equal therefor c equal c got look b mid point segment equal twice b c equat written time c side get b c equal half c triangl length side opposit degre angl alway half length hypotenus convers also hold true see come prove triangl theorem prove triangl theorem prove triangl theorem prove triangl theorem prove triangl theorem prove triangl theorem prove triangl theorem prove triangl theorem prove triangl theorem prove triangl theorem
