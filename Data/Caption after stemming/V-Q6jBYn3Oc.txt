welcom let talk synthet divis divid one polynomi linear term often school curricula nice speedi method get quickli way that complet devoid understand remain complet mysteri usual memor procedur real valu end much better purpos stuff sake speed let go synthet divis process let talk polynomi divis gener show far power come understand rather get first need understand let simpl exampl suppos wan ted take x squar plu minu multipli say plu keep fairli simpl well basic sens multipl realli geometri problem area say area rectangl rectangl one side go x plu x minu long go inch es long explicit area neg divisor side that long side that guess area mall gon na littl x squar neg divid one three piec one neg two inch es long admit dream model littl extend algebra imp lie model appropri algebra gon na take six piec look get well piec x squar time get piec x squar time that squar squar piec order like minu neg piec area product two polynomi must sum six piec nice featur lay way notic pair x line diagon see answer actual x cube plu x squar x minu there area approach work product mighti dandi actual cal led gall e method want simpl arithmet base expon base ten interest problem backward use rectangl method method revers take problem pretend dont know answer cube plu squar plu minu time want divid done rectangl method mean dont know answer goe reconstruct base answer one side well one side answer came diagon term need rectangl one diagon diagon diagon first diagon cube next diagon next angl neg answer divis problem miss side rectangl work three piec well answer ye goe um gon na advis us complex root work turban thing q mismatch es start top left corner one term cell give diagon cell must cube tell time cube choic must x squar well know that x squar top piec must time x squar x squar great like littl keep go logic deduc happen next well ye look x squar far got three piec must squar someth x x squar better x well set work cell time better oh wan ted two x diagon must neg x what tell piec neg fact stop there answer x squar plu minu littl soft check what final piec neg time neg ye match es final diagon perfect divis problem there remaind tell go done polynomi divis answer x squar minu grand that piec cake let anoth one let give time ill give answer part question squar plu plu divid x plu area problem basic given given one side side definit x plu question go need two three diagon one one x mani column mean there coupl way think tri give diagon ye stop anoth way think go x squar divid someth x probabl someth singl x need column column noth x sand noth fact two column si right weve seen give right one diagon x squar diagon x file diagon use project juic way tabl look side rectangl must well ye there one cell give give diagon top left corner must squar time x squar talk x time two x forc x wan ted seven x better someth time got mean cell togeth perfectli know squar plu divid x plu way that synthet divis synthet divis way codifi ing appear tabl without actual draw tabl write x howev synthet divis codifi ing method work linear term prefer write dont mind spend extra actual write x executor forth power realli complic divis problem synthet divis taught school would useless exampl someth look sa horrend x minu x plu that must make minu sorri minu x plu plu x squar minu x plu reason that unbeknownst anyon world buy x squar minu gon na come rectangl synthet divis set deal quadrat met fail howev know denomin tell want rectangl come one side length that three piec x squar neg mani column need need one two three four five six seven diagon pick way x sixth that go divid x squar happi much deal x fourth gon na need one x need x squar need x need x fourth hope give three diagon first diagon sixth right think gon na bother write keep look enumer x possibl come one cell top left cell sometim support x squar support x sixth see four x fourth guy neg eight x fifth forc sky four x fourth look neg six x fifth come second diagon must x fifth right x fifth someth time x squar fifth must x right therefor let move complet rest column neg x fourth must x cube right let look next diagon need neg x neg x still need neg x that diagon mean must neg x squar forc x cube forc neg x squar next diagon x cube right wive got x better neg x cube must minu x minu x time x squar neg x cube actual x squar actual neg x next diagon x x squar better x squar let see better mean note better neg better done check know check father die ignor neg x ye penultim one final one ye everyth hang polynomi divis see answer fourth x cube minu x squar minu x plu that
