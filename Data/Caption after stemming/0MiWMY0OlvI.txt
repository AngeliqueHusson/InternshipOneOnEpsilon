hey everyon weve get lot graph cube root let go ahead exampl togeth focu graph cube root function specif domain well restrict domain cube root function go look like either f x equal equal cube root someth let move exampl togeth want graph function cube root x minu domain neg call restrict domain sinc care function act neg posit care one portion think tabl valu function want x valu posit sinc look plot point realli concern x valu find valu find point plot graph construct function first x valu neg want take valu replac x origin function evalu neg equal neg cube root neg equal neg x neg neg first point go tobe graph find rest valu tabl repeat process x valu use tabl calcul input ting function equal would cube root x minu either way allow find valu input valu x keep mind go get lot sinc certain number sare perfect that complet tabl readi plot point construct graph want tous point x integ dont want estim locat valu also well see five point enough creat accur sketch function start first point neg neg go ahead plot five point eventu draw graph mistak student often make connect straight result graph incorrect boom graph cube root curv need connect point curv line graph function equal cube root x minu domain neg anoth thing look sinc domain restrict includ arrow end point graph concern graph neg posit dont care beyond domain graph afunct cube root restrict domain piec thank much guy check ing us pleas subscrib tube channel free anim math week
