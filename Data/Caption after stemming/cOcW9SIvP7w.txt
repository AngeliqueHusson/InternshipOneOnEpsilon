hey fresh shell walker green ring annulu area two concentr circl line segment tangent inner circl length eight area ring video go present five differ way solv problem even get correct answer might want keep watch end video give brief introduct visual calculu figur give problem tri readi keep watch video solut well first adjust diagram sever rotat figur tangent line horizont next well draw inner circl radiu length b vertic radiu make right angl line tangent tangent line half tangent line length draw one halv four final draw outer circl radiu length c hypotenus right triangl first way solv problem make conveni problem multipl choic test deduc singl numer answer depend dimens b c pick conveni valu b c need right triangl one life equal four might well use three four five right triangl b equal c equal five solv problem calcul area outer circl pi time c squar sinc c equal five equal calcul area inner circl pi time b squar sinc b equal equal pi final area green ring differ area outer circl area inner circl subtract two get answer pi correct answer could mark exam move there answer depend dimens b c next method ill present also give idea true first let show answer doesnt depend circl length tangent segment proceed similarli go use right triangl squar plu b squar equal c squar mean squar equal c squar minu b squar like previou method calcul area outer circl pi time c squar calcul area inner circl pi time b squar area green ring differ area outer circl area inner circl pi time c squar minu pi time b know c squar minu b squar equal squar theorem therefor answer depend quantiti equal answer pi weve proven gener length alway pi time there miller special case allow solv problem take limit case well let inner circl radiu equal shrink inner circl tangent chord becom radiu outer circl show mean demonstr graph ing calcul calcul could check provid link video descript graphic version problem equat shade green ring tangent chord whose dimens set equal equal four tangent length radiu inner circl star ted calcul area two circl calculu formula pi time squar theyr equal adjust variabl let imagin shrink inner circl radiu well obvious outer circl radiu adjust dynam see shrink well inner circl radiu goe way get outer circl radiu equal that exactli equal tangent chord length see tangent curv becom radiu outer circl calcul area see area two chang chang radiu inner circl depend length equal calcul area annulu equal pi time equal pi that approxim point shown decim interact follow decim interact also play around length tangent chord see tangent chord increas go chang area two circl tangent gourd decreas also go chang see calcul give exactli numer answer particular valu tangent go see area green ring unchang depend son look valu paramet interest interact check give understand what anoth way solv problem let return diagram use textbook geometri chord theorem chord outer circl well extend horizont line outer circl well extend vertic line chord outer circl well extend vertic line radiu outer circl differ radiu outer circl inner circl c minu b let remov thing dont need outer circl two outer second segment vertic chord equal c plu b two chord outer circl intersect divid chord product two one chord equal product chord two segment horizont chord divid four four vertic chord divid two segment c plu b c minu b multipli chord set equal tobe equal c squar minu b squar that inform return origin diagram know area ring equal area outer circl minu area inner circl pi time quantiti c squar minu b calcul c squar minu b squar equal therefor get area ring equal piso one way could solv problem doesnt requir theorem actual get base core theorem let one way could solv problem method known visual calculu mani theorem cal tech student devis new approach solv area annual led anew proof theorem imagin rotat triangl area tangent line particular look area side weep exactli area annulu consid discret version process consid area tangent degre interv area swept approxim degre approxim give idea what go one way calculu area go group tangent go rearrang common center point separ tangent go rearrang theyr common center point end anew shape exactli area shape well reminisc familiar geometr shape someth length radiu go circl radiu technic circl limit shape tangent cluster tangent wave take infinitesim small even ten could get idea tangent cluster would circl radiu exactli equal side length tangent sweep area tangent cluster rear rang new shape could imagin special case instead sweep annulu actual length sweep around center point shape would make well would make circl exactli therefor calcul tangent sweep annulu instead tri calcul could calcul term tangent cluster well know area circl equal pi time therefor that also area annulu sort thought process gener formal mannequin theorem area tangent sweep equal area tangent cluster regardless shape origin curv tangent furthermor weve done weve come new proof theorem imagin someon come new proof result known year result theorem well calcul area annulu equal pi time squar also know area annulu differ circl pi time quantiti c squar minu b squar set two formula area annual equal cancel pi rearrang get c squar exactli equal plu b squar new proof thousand year old theorem that answer problem figur way problem enjoy thank watch video pleas subscrib channel make video math game
