hello r today go talk parabola see get video done fifteen minut cant two part let talk transform learn long ago go basic parabola equal x squar rememb like say wan ted take parabola shift right two three unit sand reflect parabola like rememb made parabola seven parent function studi move around like right reflect good stuff well great dont let help go f x move parabola right rememb left right movement sho wed plu minu insid function function power two go movement right x minu two insid function els parent function move three find vertic shift constant end equat usual minu three take parabola move three place refect x axi function equat star ted neg valu red equat equat parent function move right two three reflect x axi minu two movement right neg three end shift well chapter book want go back watch anoth video class help us understand standard form parabola come standard form parabola f x equal plu minu possibl reflect x axi one graph go get appear though realli less greater zero graph compress transform section x minu h squar plu k standard form parabola one go learn today look standard form tell lot graph tell vertex vertex parabola see right two want chang sign take parenthesi neg three standard form vertex hope look familiar standard form get tie section cover week ago els parabola axi symmetri line put middl parabola go vertic parabola today go x squar squar parabola horizont studi later year x squar term vertic line axi symmetri vertic line shave equat form x equal number x valu axi symmetri go go go go vertex go x equal h x equal whatev x compon vertex case x equal posit two axi symmetri um find go minut like x intercept also parabola graph rel maximum peak fall side red parabola also rel maximum actual absolut maximum maximum two neg three talk domain rang well domain x valu graph includ neg infin posit infin rang rang neg three way neg infin case need help domain x class may say real would say domain neg infin posit infin calculu rang particular exampl red parabola well valu valu neg three goe thu rang less equal neg three interv notat start valu neg infin valu neg infin go valu neg three squar valu neg three actual use go littl tie old chapter transform left right horizont movement flip show get standard form parabola work today go work gener form parabola let go one exampl graph find solut sand nice graph sketch like student late la la la la k clean enough let take look exampl parabola got equal neg two x plu three x squar minu four k parabola would call gener form gener form want count go right mine dont expon one two go rewrit equal three x squar minu two x minu four go let use function notat gener form parabola squar plu b x plu c go graph parabola gener form later year studi ing conic section lot squar process put gener form standard form squar today standard form given parabola ked graph parabola form well step one find x vertex found neg b neg neg two b c b c two three go come two six one third k great start understand vertex part vertex found take x valu plug back function go three time one third squar minu two time one third minu four go three time one ninth minu two third minu four littl fraction work today go one third minu two third minu want put three togeth denomin one go multipli top bottom three common denomin neg three wont minu twelv three one minu two neg one neg one minu twelv neg thirteen three parabola vertex one third neg thirteen three good got far go eras way dont think fit board u h let see enough make sketch vertex one third comma neg thirteen three mani three thirteen four leav remaind one go neg four one third littl less neg four need make anoth tick mark one littl bit past neg four right vertex see lead coeffici lead coeffici posit parabola go open three neg parabola would open know parabola go open point could easili find help us graph parabola make sketch let take look intercept intercept want let x equal zero cross axi x horizont movement x zero fairli easi zero switch function notat go three time zero squar minu two time zero minu four f zero intercept go neg four anoth point right shall color code intercept right go need eras work help us find intercept go involv factor ing quadrat formula shown littl bit factor ing recent go remind quadrat formula actual done recent well anyway intercept let x equal zero go find x intercept let ting equal zero almost eras problem want find x intercept mean let equal zero want solv x intercept solv equat three x squar minu two x minu four equal zero alright let see look like quadrat formula case dont rememb quadrat formula x equal neg b plu minu squar root b squar minu four c two go appli quadrat formula quadrat equat gener form mean three b go neg two c neg four go x equal neg b watch parenthesi plug help plu minu squar root b squar minu four c two go two plu minu squar root four plu four twelv forti eight six go two plu minu squar root fifti two six want reduc answer exact form fifti two squar root four time squar root thirteen six exact form two plu minu two squar root thirteen six hah ado know x axi dont either type calcul calcul go get decim approxim go cheat neg point eight seven one point five solv quadrat equat quadrat formula pretti sure could done factor ing well x intercept neg point eight seven neg eight point seven posit one point five parabola let see domain run time x neg infin posit infin parabola open forev rang go valu valu neg four point eras oh neg four point three three infin axi symmetri vertic line equat x equal eras everyth fast well whatev x valu vertex axi symmetri woo go homework thank graph ing parabola w vertex intercept graph ing parabola w vertex intercept graph ing parabola w vertex intercept graph ing parabola w vertex
