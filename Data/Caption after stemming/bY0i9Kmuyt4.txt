video gon na go sketch realli realli rough sketch logarithm necessarili gon na perfect point long know translat across plane help sometim abl rough sketch base logarithm graph right log x base b b would greater one long base greater one alright know graph go one zero go goup right hug axi make axi vertic asymptot right sinc rough sketch know dont realli know exactli know steep angl goe rough enough sketch good know long base greater one know gon na go go back forth logarithm x exponenti form right youv got law expon say number rais power alway right fit logarithm graph go go right right base graph take equat log x base b make base fraction thing go graph still go go go kind flip go hug axi vertic asymptot top come right there two basic graph want memor base greater hug vertic asymptot bottom goe base hug vertic asymptot top come right basic shift rule appli log number insid function shift opposit left right shift graph opposit left right youv got number outsid tell go shift throw neg neg front log go got reflect realli hard think base graph neg kind kind hard describ alright neg insid reflect across vertic asymptot left right heresi vertic asymptot alright graph would reflect left right know basic shift that gon na go sketch es refer shift opposit left right point go shift go shift point goe one zero graph that point actual go shift right notic vertic asymptot one left point right vertic asymptot one left point shift point start shift exampl also go shift vertic asymptot go make sure exactli one left point go shift that said three exampl sketch guess sketch rough sketch tri get accur graph right gon na go one go start red gon na start point right put red hope show video that red point part graph get readi sketch that go use go shift right side function need shift opposit left right see see posit tell go shift gon na take point right like guid point that gon na tell ship go shift toto left there one two put go neg right point shift left vertic asymptot log function also alway one left point right neg two vertic asymptot go ahead put alright gon na come back look base base bigger one tell gon na hug vertic asymptot bottom go right even though that littl crook gon na hug vertic asymptot realli gon na go point right right like said realli rough sketch dont know exactli know high sharp that gon na go least know graph done translat left right one got shift left right also shift well gon na start point alright keep mind red red dot right part function right thing red dot part function sketch refer point move around right go look right insid minu insid function shift opposit left right mean go go right spot right right plu tell go shift see minu mean go go go right gon na go gon na take point that go move gon na go right gon na go that point go alright point shift vertic asymptot go aswel sinc point sit right mean vertic asymptot one vertic asymptot got go hope get one littl bit straight right there berg la improv well right go come back gon na take look base base three number bigger one know gon na hug vertic asymptot low go right sinc rough sketch whether know dont know dont know quickli shortli realli quick hereat point right that know plane gener shape right right last exampl look insid function tell opposit left right see plu three gon na go left three go come outsid function neg two mean go go alright move point imaginari point gon na put graph aton zero right start point part actual graph that gon na shift go shift one two left sorri three left two right one two three left two three left two put point right point shift vertic asymptot goe log function also shift also alway one left neg one neg two put vertic asymptot go neg three right gon na come take look base base number zero one hug vertic asymptot come gon na hug top come go make sure go point right right red dot initi graph part logarithm function right three quick littl sketch es logarithm function shift around plane help also talk logarithm function realli good time review look fact logarithm function exponenti function invers right done drawn coupl pictur pictur left pretti much import one two go work right recal exponenti graph alright goe zero one greater one know base greater one exponenti function go zero one right go right right logarithm function base greater one go havent go one zero right hug vertic asymptot along axi goe right invers equal x line got x line got exponenti function logarithm function show reflect equal x line kind good sierra graph probabl point logarithm function graph look like probabl alreadi previous loo ked exponenti function well pictur right lesson common howev still base that fraction base right graph hug differ spot right exponenti function k fraction base would look like alright kind exponenti decay type problem alright equal x line right reflect exponenti equat line would get logarithm function base zero one hug go one zero right coupl pictur kind let easili see
