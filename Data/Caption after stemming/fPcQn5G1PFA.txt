three interior angl angl four five six would exterior angl triangl notic form linear pair interior angl sand look triangl angl four five six would exterior form linear pair interior angl sit realli n matter side extend angl four congruent angl four angl five congruent angl five angl six congruent angl six let take look coupl exampl want determin measur indic coupl thing rememb first sum interior triangl alway one hundr eighti degre sand know also know exterior linear pair interior angl look angl two know measur angl two plu one hundr thirti eight equal one hundr eighti degre form linear pair subtract one hundr thirti eight side equat know measur angl two must forti two degre sand similar way measur angl one plu nineti four equal one hundr eighti subtract nineti four side measur angl one degre sand look interior angl know measur angl one plu measur angl two plu measur angl three must equal one hundr eighti degre well measur angl one eighti six degre measur angl two forti two degre n know measur angl three know sum one hundr eighti eighti six plu forti two one hundr subtract one hundr twenti eight side measur angl three would give us fifti two degre sand determin measur angl four know angl three angl four form linear pair one hundr eighti fifti two degre give us measur angl four one hundr twenti eight take moment sum exterior triangl nineti four degre one hundr twenti eight degre one hundr thirti eight go twenti carri two go eleven thirteen sixteen carri one three hundr sixti degre notic interior exterior angl form three three time one hundr eighti degre would give hundr forti degre subtract sum angl alway one hundr eighti degre would get three hundr sixti match es sum exterior come back idea later video let take look anoth exampl go littl bit quick er know interior exterior angl linear pair therefor sum would one hundr eighti one eighti minu one twenti four go give us fifti six degre angl one hundr eighti degre minu nineti five degre eighti five degre sand know sum interior angl go one hundr eighti degre fifti six degre plu eight five degre gong one hundr forti one one eighti minu one forti one go give us thirti nine degre angl one two form linear pair one eighti minu thirti nine go give us one hundr forti one degre angl let talk coupl theorem involv exterior angl prove next coupl sum exterior angl triangl well polygon alway three hundr sixti tri point ear lier know interior exterior three linear pair therefor sum angl one six would one hundr eighti degre time three five hundr forti degre sand also know sum interior angl triangl one hundr eighti degre take five hundr forti degre subtract one hundr eighti degre alway hundr sixti degre sum exterior angl triangl alway hundr sixti degre also true polygon talk last theorem let defin remot remot angl two angl triangl adjac angl specif exterior angl pick one exterior angl let say angl two interior angl adjac angl one would angl two angl three angl two angl three remot angl one angl special relationship exterior angl sum remot interior angl equal nonadjac exterior angl angl one angl two three remot angl measur angl two plu measur angl three equal measur angl one let talk call angl four measur angl one plu measur angl four equal one hundr eighti also know sum interior angl one hundr eighti know measur angl two plu measur angl three plu measur angl four equal one hundr eighti degre swell solv first equat measur angl one measur angl one one hundr eighti degre minu measur angl solv equat measur angl two plu measur angl three would thing one hundr eighti degre minu measur angl four
