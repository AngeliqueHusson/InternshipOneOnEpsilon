video want explain differ factori permut choos take look calcul find place see n exclam n factori see video go show use button cant find button calcul might want get better one let start n factori realli easi exampl let say like three differ color want arrang row could arrang blue one first purpl red could keep blue one first swap two like could put red one first option well option final could put purpl one first option well option sever way let count way arrang three think first posit posit third posit hold first marker marker third marker three choic want first posit soon make choic go two remain ing let say red next posit one left pretti straightforward see three choic first posit time two choic second posit time one choic remain ing last posit write three factori check let see work three select n factori well dont want four use shift function push get immedi answer six know three factori time three time two time one head ten object want arrang possibl way want know mani way that factori would write would say number way arrang object si factori equal time time time time time time time dont realli want type calcul that factori button type go tous shift factori that answer number way arrang differ object row let say object dont care ar rang mayb book want put book onto bookshelf might want know mani way could let say book want onto bookshelf well realli similar kind problem go book go end choic book right first posit go choic youv use one book book left choos next posit youv use anoth book choic final choic would number way arrang four object collect object might wonder know let think easi exampl like go breakfast let say four type bread jam want make toast jam first go choos bread use go choos jam use four choic first task go follow next task basic could think decis tree go decid one four option youv made one choic decid type jam total number time need perform two task gener mani task seri task need figur mani way multipli number way first number way task let take exampl ar rang three know answer three factori littl bit one three thing go first posit next task ha sa differ number choic need look given inform task number one choic number two that there two choic next one one choic final one littl bit differ toast would choos rye bread choos strawberri jam dont two choic take look ten object sand want order four know number way ten time nine time eight time seven littl bit like factori right like pattern stop point stop got seven didnt continu six five four three two one didnt wan ted directli calcul would would ten permut four calcul mean say tri would like arrang four object youd like know mani way ten object want arrang four care order need use p button p r use shift get p notic tell that tell r r answer doubl check let make sure get five thousand forti way know correct ten time nine time eight correct type ten permut four calcul give answer ten time nine time eight time seven cours give full product think actual sofar written time time time time time time time written obvious know that answer answer divid piec doesnt make sens piec that piec dont care care well let say arrang figur number way arrang object that worri first number way arrang last part necessari dont need worri last six divid divid done time time time time ill use differ color right let write factori divid minu that exactli factori divid factori way rememb gener n object tri permut r way permut mean select order answer n factori divid n minu r factori hope understand n factori mean also n permut mean guy choos r differ figur written definit n factori rememb number way permut order n object row thing except want order r r less equal n let think would happen object peopl thing whatev let object want select four dont care order exampl mayb book son shelf mayb peopl select ing committe doesnt matter pick al ice bob bob al ice theyr go end committe sort way come equival dont care order well think let say go pick order would like n p r case p exampl look number way select select mean order doesnt matter object collect start say p p that go give us number way select four thing four object order ing object severi differ order ing want divid manyway arrang four peopl what that factori get factori divid factori definit p divid factori weve pick peopl differ divid arrang peopl that differ p r mean order that go get p r c r without order ing that go get type calcul see last exampl ten peopl want choos four dont care order choos go select shift get choos function four equal notic way choos peopl fact took number way choos four peopl number way arrang four peopl would time factori get back number way choos rang choos arrang p type calcul realli choos count number way select object group mayb peopl goon committe want know mani possibl way committe built there member committe answer c see next time could two power possibl sequenc math skill find factori permut combin choos math skill find factori permut combin
