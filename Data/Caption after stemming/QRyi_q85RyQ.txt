welcom follow consid standard part algebra realli sure goe let graph let suppos one situat mean liter came final exam cours realiz never actual cours youv got go suppos one final exam graph follow polynomi littl linear let someth like x plu time x plu squar plu x fifth say time x minu four thousand six time x minu isl crazi power alright goe didnt go cours nonetheless face question sketch graph function well group four point let follow draw set quarter know go graph kind x axi axi vertic one look beast ask interest x valu interest x valu stare mein face exampl know put neg term becom give whole polynomi come write note right away know neg graph x equal neg interest x valu put neg formula get someth x x sometim someth neg graph must cross x axi also neg right weve got point without know anyth x equal interest there anoth x intercept x equal anoth interest point graph x axi valu great there astart guess name keep tri intellig without realli know see build pictur graph function basic cell see thing output ting clever choic x gave ah let talk intercept go posit neg well wont work hard suppos put x equal zero first term go posit next term go posit squar tear would posit fact anyth sixth also posit neg six posit number neg post least say intercept squar x fifth time neg time neg go probabl huge posit number dont know graph axi posit valu right good trick go let tri anoth interest valu x let go someth extrem happen put x equal million graph well would million plu cube that posit term would posit someth squar posit million plu fifth posit egg million minu posit especi rais sixth power million minu eight posit special eras power si get huge posit number extrem valu x know huge posit valu must go like let sell thing tri clever without work fact what anoth good interest x valu extrem somehow x equal neg million well thing go chang slightli put neg million neg million plu huge neg number that neg guy someth squar stay posit guy someth fifth power neg number neg million plu fifth power neg neg million minu neg number six power still posit neg million minu eight power posit net effect get neg x posit x neg x politician posit x equal neg million ill posit number go huge posit extrem right deserv half point right wive graph function know across x axi particular five valu know posit intercept must huge posit us go extrem part right what huge posit us go extrem far left sens connect dot littl care dont realli know what go neg neg say let examin let choos number that two let say know neg someth that wont actual evalu let ask graph posit neg point like neg neg neg goe put neg first term posit number put neg middl term second term would neg number get squar posit neg plu neg fifth power neg number rais fifth power neg neg minu neg sixth power posit whatev posit fact abl think anyth pod even power go posit posit posit think theyr alway posit term neg neg neg see whole thing must posit time posit time neg x posit posit neg number let tri anoth valu let tri neg well let tri say neg like guy neg plu posit number cube still posit term someth squar still posit middl term neg plu neg fifth power neg stay neg sixth power alway posit neg minu n emesi power alway posit want neg well neg well alreadi done posit whoop shouldnt put neg one that silli want neg twixt four eight let tri know six well term want cube term must posit alway posit term want six plu two eight eight fifth power posit put six posit alway posit put six get neg two power posit thing want posit eight someth extrem like see alreadi posit well go tell graph want bounc x intercept place work across want posit indic neg region actual see graph look like there someth like start neg neg huge posit touch zero fact want neg next certain cut x axi neg go go back neg want neg neg neg graph must come neg fora go back neg graph want posit trick neg graph must someth follow ilk go back posit next rang posit four eight ga graph must bounc posit go back zero eight want posit see graph must someth ilk crude sketch tobe honest go strang tell say valid four eighth posit dont realli know graph four eight posit felt like everi right mind draw graph four eight idea whoop one idea what actual go mayb graph someth like would valid interpret polynomi that fine fact studi calculu learn graph four eight bump dont know stage ked sketch graph would say that fine featur that valid sketch particular tri anoth one let much simpler one that crazi time let eras well ask ourself graph ing polynomi part tan ton mathemat graph ing polynomi part tan ton mathemat graph ing
