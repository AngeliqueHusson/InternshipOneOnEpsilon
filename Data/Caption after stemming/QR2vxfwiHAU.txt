let say ellips formula x squar plu squar b squar equal sake discuss well assum greater band us let us go tobe kind short fat ellips semimajor axi major axi go along horizont minor axi along vertic let draw draw ellips want draw thick er say that ellips let draw axe sok horizont right vertic weve studi ellips pretti good detail far know figur semiminor radiu case know b that b right that semiminor radiu b smaller b greater would major radiu cours major radiu distanc right anoth super interest perhap interest properti ellips take point ellips measur distanc point two special point sake discuss sake discuss pretti much forev call foci two point alway sit along major axi case horizont axi theyr symmetr around center let call point let call one super interest fascin properti often use definit ellips take point ellips measur distanc two let say distanc right call distanc distanc take point ellips particular point distanc two foci differ color whole line right that find two distanc sum plu go constant actual turn equal turn true anywher go ellips let make point clear actual go prove constant distanc actual right make sure understand say let take anoth arbitrari point take right measur distanc point focu let call point measur distanc point focu let scall point sum two point still go equal write plu still go equal neat actual often use definit ellips say ellips set sometim theyll use word locu kind graphic represent set point sum distanc focu es equal well play littl bit well figur figur focu es ellips first thing feel satisfi distanc true equal easiest way figur pick guess could call extrem point along alreadi make claim distanc let draw anoth color distanc plu distanc go equal constant number extrem point go show constant number equal let figur one thing realiz two focu point symmetr around origin whatev distanc right go distanc right two point symmetr around origin right distanc cours want figur sum distanc longer distanc right well what sum plu green distanc well right plu green let write let write let call distanc g say let call g let call h g h also know g everyth symmetr what g plu h well that thing g plu h entir major diamet ellips well know minor radiu length right also distanc sum distanc point ellips focu plu point ellips focu equal g plu h big green part thing major diamet ellips thing enough hope good enough next thing weve realiz figur foci stand equat figur two point figur first thing realiz sudden matter go easi even take point right say distanc sum distanc also equal could use inform actual figur foci lie let say let draw anoth one that want draw axe clariti let write equat dont lose x squar squar plu squar b squar equal take point right extrem point alway use tri prove someth dont want say said two foci symmetr around center ellips weve alreadi said ellips locu set point take point distanc focu es add get constant number weve figur constant number weve figur take distanc right add distanc right equal could say call know plu equal interest thing symmetr right length go go everyth symmetr two focal length symmetr distanc distanc distanc right there way could exact center point ellips ellips symmetr around equal equal know equal equal ai think make progress thing think alreadi previou draw ellips distanc distanc semiminor radiu alreadi learn band cours focal length tri figur alreadi pop brain problem focal length could triangl triangl ill right one focal length flet call f f squar plu b squar go equal hypotenus squar case equal nice equat term b awe know b equat given let solv focal length focal length f squar equal squar minu b squar f focal length go equal squar root squar minu b squar pretti neat clean pretti intuit way think someth liter take differ whichev whichev smaller subtract one take squar root that focal distanc let see use appli real problem might ask hey find focal length find let add equat x minu squar plu plu squar equal let graph first could interest ill draw axe that immedi see what center center go point neg that might want review previou x equal equal minu center major axi x axi larg rand b squar squar equal semiminor radiu go equal go go think let go roughli direct semiminor radiu go right squar root b equal go go ellips go look someth like pick good color go look someth like want want find focal focal point go sit along semimajor axi need figur focal distanc sand essenti add subtract center well sho wed hope sho wed focal length distanc f focal length equal squar root differ two right squar root minu focal length equal squar root point right point point center ellips point minu focu right go squar root minu focu right go minu squar root minu took focal length sinc along major axe x axi subtract x get right anyway realli neat thing interest relat foci relat focu point sand futur video ill show foci hyperbola foci well one focu parabola realli start get section neat everyth weve done point much mechan graph ing plot conic get littl bit interest part conic next
