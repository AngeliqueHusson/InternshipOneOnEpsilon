hello r finish talk exponenti function graph ing lead us natur logarithm si would like calcul handi log find button calcul equal two logarithm book say form logarithm equal base b x x greater zero b greater zero x b must posit log equal well write log standard base ten log base equal alway use exampl start logarithm one head might recogn go k yeah squar equal see equival equat written two form one written log form exponenti form simpl exampl use time class show go logarithm sit noth take logarithm get look form comfort got expon base log end base expon form log base squar equal base look equat exponenti form want go log form exponenti form base log base expon log exponenti form answer log base equival equat squar form exponenti form keep mind go eras write like write help go back forth log exponenti form log base answer get logarithm expon let use pattern pleas write base subscript n write main line go make look like lot multipl may write log base go look like log confus teacher use go back forth exponenti form log form see evalu basic log equal log base true statement get logarithm go convert log form may familiar exponenti form well log form go exponenti form base answer expon base log go base expon get logarithm keep chant get logarithm take log exponenti form actual answer equal log base becom fourth equal take look anoth exampl neg equal actual true true true exponenti see log function rememb base neg expon get rid neg expon flip one third third power equal write log form log base expon base expon base logarithm answer answer exponenti form go take log go log base get logarithm get expon neg might ice let put back log equal squar equal might ice log function undo hundr appli common log get take squar get back someth start someth get make expon get back exponenti form logarithm invers math oper sit like addit subtract multipl divis time said addit subtract multipl time equal divid get back multipl divis invers get back addit subtract invers function sa coupl express go log form exponenti exponenti form log take look tri evalu log base might go well tri check back book work calcul log base calcul log base common log log base e cal led natur log tal ked natur log yet equal n know like put extra part textbook give question ask evalu write whole equat see base answer go expon write log function exponenti form go x equal first logarithm section textbook go give problem head without aid calcul four power equal think four third equal anoth ye x equal wrote base expon someth lot solv equat involv equat n need logarithm solv good alright let take look question log base equal n know know textbook give log function probabl go abl base calcul wo n abl inspir calcul wont let write log function exponenti form base answer get logarithm expon x power equal write base move top numer like left hand side allow neg expon ye log base equal neg expon allow becom well neg onehow log base textbook might said base log equal base log alway go cancel would equal let explain equal say read book know log base go fill express base answer expon convert logarithm exponenti form get logarithm expon base expon base answer convert log form exponenti form seven x equal seven well expon seven x equal seven must mean x equal would x equal second power would mean x would equal problem written natur log yet let see least one natur log e fifth equal well r n even tal ked idea l n explain natur log l n log base e go take natur log e see like base start stack might know go happen like pi pi approxim equal e approxim equal one run well indefinit number show electr engin natur compound growth n want deriv come standard numer valu natur log log base e see base might think cancel would right go write log form exponenti form see base expon answer base expon answer well look simpl equat side equal base side expon must x equal see enough time say oh base match let drop say x equal let see squeez anoth exampl minut alarm goe rais log base need write common log textbook may say cancel n need write go leav say equal let figur say n know express equal snow equat exponenti form log form let write logarithm form log base expon answer get express answer x expon well expon log base see get expon answer exponenti form look log base function base x must equal textbook show base log base touch cancel base ye x equal r thank watch go
