factor ing trinomi readi class say math say k mani home wonder student jacket dont blend back head look yeah right oh yeah wrap anoth class go g squar plu plu right question alreadi love go trinomi good trinomi polynomi equat three polynomi mani term equat dont know type trinomi type polynomi excel hear someon said take fantast that great said first thing first common factor common factor start factor ing process alright boil process f time f time squar ah say yeah next index like side thing one time one seven x squar would x x x x clear next good star ted go go one time think yeah two two four four one way want let tri tell let two go right let foil dude foil check forget even though posit squar right squar time x x somehow add let tri one like game show let tri want put four think think tell want put four yeah yeah one second one one interest put word good put um oh oh love moment oh good l four time right right would plu void oh exactli exactli go say oh say intent yeah good good right let make oil check squar x x x x ye reason reason yeah parenthes bigger like insid seven yeah multipli seven make need one may first parenthes would right put four four would x would x ill make usual put thank know depend middl term celebr put bigger number mean put bigger number still laugh that awesom mani factor still mani factor two two factor factor say solv anyth time go set first factor x plu question ye best question that answer answer solv x need solv absolut done resent h factor zero x plu zero think everyon write dont see everyon write look oh yeah saw go neg hum one sixteenth mous word great great right k two answer solv alreadi gon na readi readi game pleas dont giggl realli awesom ladi gentl men giggl sok solv may five refin right solv need set equat equal zero make side equal zero pleas add three eight nine sport wait wait wait pleas wait three side well stanc want set time zero combin tutor ad side subtract oh leav us minu equal zero right common oh yeah yeah oh wait noth goe right go time squar think ye na possibl might even answer recommend tri make instead support case gener gener go right right would work part experi less extrem think tonight like let put go leav sign volunt foil check check ye squar hey squar good six eight six nine nine good news good news great news right that good that posit right good news great neg posit add neg six ye front six front six two neg front twelv posit right go twelv posit posit creat twelv hope see wait first one second one right way check four time three twelv eight that wherein foil thing right make neg six want say dont like want say neg put neg front right cool neg time posit neg good check work question ye would work like interest question work weve done eight there one answer right good news there one answer go take put line whatev check one step away yeah yeah oh yeah find what four minu three zero right yeah minu equal plu solv go ped mode go plu plu equal equal right lap dont mode dont speak wish speak ye yeah hey shut bilingu game would say hey ill watch good bring us great class enter neg halv right good set right set factor there common factor factor tri less extrem like six time two squar minu equal cal led three go factor what first step common factor one yeah yeah wait common factor there x first one hey what common factor three term wasnt goe anyth els go yeah number whole un distribut time ya squar squar x minu seven x minu minu l right also great news becom much easier factor much easier alright trinomi cant take factor turn colleg would good question right write oh yeah yeah yeah part time squar ye x right oh yeah next one time six think six one two three want feel well look put make x sit yeah put ill x oh hope omega kill yeah three two two link that tutor let tri want put let tri right let tri understand multipli make time right foil got keep cool let see work see boil middl squar r number six ah ye process well take question squar exact x x somehow combin make let tri matter order matter snow right format go give tri someon els foil check pleas ye um six act swell let um justic oh what readi squar squar x right good news right one need neg one need posit make neg hear neg need neg two need posit need neg let let us think make neg make x strip yeah good oh right check neg neg cool x need posit confirm also time neg step neg reason like begin anyth correct anyth ignor face ill tell yeah dont get use six one wouldnt work tie paper wouldnt work go one answer far good question ye ye didnt talk whatev solut would still abl factor ye ye would still abl factor would bigger one one would doubl distribut say six begin x hear say oka yi take toit right solv two extran mean unnecessari realli affect problem rule math divid side two divid side two would happen two theyr cancel ling savior would cancel zero would stay zero fantast wow would make write cant sort ignor equat ignor yeah divid cancel anyway cant say bye say bye slice yeah say bye equat say bye technic what happen divid two want know let rewrit plu minu set factor zero x minu equal zero alright x equal neg hope solv track two side divid side done add three side three guy skip ped step reim give credit abl solv simpl equat time thing much past twenti thirti nine twenti thirti nine right that good place cut question let read put oh yeah say good bye would say bye mad
