first thing go gon na draw graph dont care look like let tri put vertic nice there graph gon na give vertex graph number choos randomli even neg number got neg two dont know want right three one minu one dont know anoth two rule game goal make sure none vertic neg think one name game game imagin five peopl amount money debt move make game either donat money mean vertex theyr connect give dollar person take money mean vertex theyr connect take dollar goal game make sure everyon debt choos give take give take everyon connect that right that right let take look exampl weve drawn see win game think well think three person give good k let let differ color dont get confus goe mean goe goe good neg instead neg better get everyon debt three need give cross written yeah weve got extra money dont move want move could three consecut move move money yeah yeah that right sok dont want debt let three move time well donat vertex connect guy two problem vertic left two minu tri dont consolid oh let tri want donat oh sorri went usual two oh way oh sorri see let said thing everyon goe minu one minu four right yeah person give good good yeah let get rid five give goe two one two minu two guess everi time someth move back right yeah go zero three yeah anoth good good zero minu one oh good that right one one zero oh went went right much much difficulti weve got zero one zero one one demonstr well obviou took optim strategi win game possibl could move one question could ask hand game like draw graph assign move win game even ask question might wonder possibl win game right like star ted obvious imposs matter tri go finish problem even think star ted properti dont add someth like sum neg money board get everyon debt exactli obvious constraint win let slightli simpler version let say two vertic well connect edg question kind money put game make possibl exampl say work make winnabl game answer well long win game thing need win enough money word weve got non neg sum bank board let someth similar vertic obviou exactli still true right mean let say someth neg mayb dont know neg want enough money board got least let say donat money posit vertex vertic way theyr connect alway balanc two thing true two vertex exampl also true vertex exampl let tri differ arrang three vertic turn possibl arrang enough money board never win game show way happen assign number minu let think what go happen enough money board right sum donat one posit vertic immedi turn neg that true matter mani time tri never get rid fact neg vertex graph even though there enough money board alway move yeah that right there much connect right what differ two graph cant move sort freeli two chosen vertic donat noth second case enough game winnabl enough enough money board possibl graph question tell turn realli complic actual answer question definit advis sort mess around littl bit draw kind graph want probabl want connect make game littl bit interest assign respect idea youv got enough money board right see thing end yeah realli could mean depend patienc level next time airport someth often that someth play game want know yeah yeah full answer actual realli complic let tell partial answer tell game definit winnabl certain case there special number assign graph call genu genu graph number edg graph minu number vertic graph plu one simpl count genu case genu weve got one edg weve got two vertic add genu zero case weve got two vertic add one get zero case weve got three vertic plu one give way detect notion littl connect right complic tri move money around graph number genu give idea much complic turn show graph must winnabl way win game amount money larg genu graph that surplu that surplu knew game winnabl exactli zero dollar board know game winnabl said number dollar board genu zero right graph genu long there zero dollar board win game yeah that right could three would work right bad game exampl didnt work zero dollar board bu there reason genu one order win game youv got least one dollar board thing that kind funni actual absolut character win game sometim might less money think need still win game actual tri figur exactli nice character win game pretti complic even even prove true much money genu graph win realli advanc graph theori would realli interest see dont think given homework would realli interest see much straightforward argument true much money guarante win set move win game geniu first game much money oh that good question let figur weve got one two three four weve got five vertic genu one also start star ted six minu three star ted board realli sort rig ged game abl better probabl say could taken board still would abl still weird go back look littl difficult doesnt yeah that guarante long draw solitair graph properti there alway way win even take long time think interest thing winnabl also think incred interest minim number move yeah winnabl complic prove dont think proof complet character optim strategi game like puzzl like one
