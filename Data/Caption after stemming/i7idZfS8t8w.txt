video go expos mayb one least top five use formula youv seen mani video know big fan recommend memor caveat also rememb prove dont want rememb thing know came said let show talk quadrat formula might guess solv root quadrat let speak gener term ill show let say equat form ax squar plu b x plu c equal recogn quadrat equat b c well coeffici x squar term second degre term b coeffici x term c could imagin coeffici x zero term constant term given gener quadrat equat like quadrat formula tell us equat x equal neg b plu minu squar root b squar minu know seem crazi convolut hard memor right get lot practic actual pretti reason formula stick brain someplac might say gee wacki formula come next video go show came want get use first realli came squar equat right complet squar actual go get solut quadrat formula right let appli problem let start someth could verifi give us answer let say x squar plu equal situat let differ equal right coeffici x squar term b equal coeffici c equal neg constant term let plug formula get get x tell us x go equal neg b neg b neg put neg sign front neg b plu minu squar root b squar b squar squar minu time time c neg put neg sign cancel like sinc first time let skip mani neg see fit simplifi hope get x equal neg plu minu squar root let see neg time neg that go give us posit plu let see time plu nice that nice perfect squar go equal neg plu minu could divid term right equal neg divid neg minu divid tell us x could equal neg plu x could equal neg minu neg quadrat formula seem given answer verifi substitut back work could even tri factor right say two take product get neg take sum get posit youd get x plu time x minu equal neg time neg neg minu posit would get x plu sorri neg equal get x plu equal x equal could equal neg x could equal definit give us answer factor ing might say hey bother crazi reason want bother crazi mess also work problem hard factor let coupl let problem right let scroll get fresh real rewrit formula case havent memor yet x go equal neg b plu minu squar root b squar minu suppli anoth say equat squar plu equal neg first thing want get form term left hand side side equat get squar plu plu equal use quadrat formula let appli equal b right c quadrat formula tell us equat root quadrat function guess could call x go equal neg b b neg plu minu squar root b squar b get squar minu time c stretch radic littl bit time get x equal neg plu minu squar root minu interest minu time minu time time minu interest might alreadi realiz go simplifi minu that make becom go equal neg plu minu squar root posit that minu minu go neg might say gee crazi silli quadrat formula sal worthless give squar root neg number give answer reason give answer least answer might want real solut futur go introduc someth cal led imaginari number squar root neg number actual express actual solut involv imaginari actual real solut take squar root neg number b squar b squar minu term right neg go real solut sand let verifi get graphic calcul let graph equat right let get graph equal that squar plu plu that equat go see equal let graph notic thing come goe back vertex sit x axi never intersect point express function equal point equal graph quadrat formula seem one exampl never see enough exampl want know mayb obviou factor let say get neg squar plu plu equal let tri quadrat formula x satisfi equat go neg b b neg b neg plu minu squar root b squar that b squar minu neg time c time time neg neg go equal neg plu minu squar root neg time neg cancel plu plu neg suspect simplifi could mayb bring thing radic sign let attempt let prime factor part simplifi ing radic thing time thing time that time squar root equal squar root time could say that squar root time time squar root obvious go squar root squar root time squar root properli time look like right simplifi neg plu minu squar root neg divid numer denomin mayb equal neg plu minu squar root neg could separ two term could say equal neg neg minu squar root neg right right cancel divid get notic plu use minu sign plu becom neg neg becom posit still doesnt matter right could say minu plu that thing plu minu squar root nine think that simpl get want make clear point last step forget neg said doesnt matter go turn posit neg go turn neg posit let rewrit right written plu squar root neg minu squar root neg right that plu minu mean could realli situat neg turn squar root take neg neg neg becom posit get plu squar root right neg time neg posit plu minu squar plu minu squar root equat right curiou graph look like let look let clear clear neg three squar plu plu graph see intersect goe back plu minu squar see squar root go littl bit right squar go littl bit go littl bit littl bit divid littl bit go get one valu that littl bit anoth valu littl bitless look like case valu that pretti close anoth valu littl bit look close mayb littl bit less anyway hope found applic quadrat formula help use quadrat formula polynomi ration function algebra khan academi use quadrat
