today go talk unit circl reason talk super import topic one concept could pick rememb trigonometri would need calculu would unit circl use often better unit memori easier calculu go reason look angl unit circl time today go talk unit circl go use calculu come build unit circl interest three thing first interest imag unit circl right hand side want label one place circl well talk second also interest angl interest radian degre go say angl radian want label also want abl label angl angl go indiffer color keep track less go label unit circl build unit circl order go first angl angl degre come build along unit circl first thing want rememb unit circl cal led unit circl reason reason radiu equal one unit talk point unit circl center origin point point unit circl alway center origin radiu circl r equal that distanc origin point distanc r equal radiu equal that cal led unit circl one unit sinc know sinc cal led unit circl know go distanc one along x axi right sinc center origin x axi right go distanc one along x axi posit direct x axi point right weve gone distanc along x axi still valu point similarli could label point neg radiu left hand side circl want label point along axi point x valu point neg cal led major axe x axi axi label littl bit tricki actual deriv muse angl associ go right give way way rememb go label point go big parenthes go say give us two fraction denomin equal thing thing like realli common way rememb unit circl go go write like x go along last step take squar root numer take squar root one right squar root still leav squar root cant simplifi write squar root cant simplifi squar root squar root squar root squar root associ right associ valu point first quadrant realli easi find point three quadrant chang sign exampl move quadrant x valu go neg neg x territori valu go posit say point go neg root three two borrow point directli across neg posit go neg x neg root posit root go neg x valu neg posit valu root like move quadrant go posit neg valu label borrow directli first quadrant posit x valu root neg valu posit becom neg point posit root x valu neg root valu point posit x equal neg root valu last quadrant go valu neg x valu neg valu neg go get neg root neg go get neg root neg go get neg neg root go unit circl want look angl radian well way star ted point along axi posit direct go start point angl radian talk angl radianc angl go alway start angl posit direct x axi move counterclockwis around circl like posit radiant angl go occur counterclockwis direct go move way go realiz go full circl know angl go two pi get way back begin angl two pi go tobe zero two pi right cours entir circl pi half circl right go pi saya quarter circl work backward half circl pi quarter circl go half pi word pi want angl along neg direct axi know pi plu anoth quarter circl know quarter circl pi pi plu pi end pi make sens start zero count half pi quarter circl get pi pi pi pi pi pi count pi quarter circl look pi term pi split quarter pie get half angl right pi half pi pi count start pi pi right pi pi pi pi pi like get final pi pi last need know angl pi pi actual angl pi notic line angl pi angl fact way toward pi area doubl area right rememb that pi cours take pi multipli get equal pi that know pi also find pi know angl angl pi see notic distanc right distanc distanc notic theyr equal distanc equal pi angl pi could alway take pi divid that cours equal pi time equal pi that anoth way know pi count pi line go pi pi simplifi pi cours pi pi cours pi pi cant simplifi way pi pi get pi pi pi pi pi pi pi way pi pi cours pi weve mark radian let go ahead look angl degre said angl also go go around circl one full time rememb one full turn degre zero way go attack way went radian go half say angl go take half say angl go go halfway go get cours make sens start zero add degre sat time get cut half angl half angl right start zero count get zero right seven pi four back get us back know first angl one third degre angl nineti divid three give us know that also say also give us say start zero count zero add add get add get back angl degre that build unit circl memori import calculu well go use unit circl million differ thing common way well use unit circl someth like cosin pi evalu come problem calculu well need figur valu cosin pi well unit circl point repres cosin sine angl point point theyr actual cosin theta sine theta mean valu repres cosin angl valu repres sine angl look first angl pi six cosin pi six find pi six sinc cosin take x valu point cosin pi would root sine pi would tell us find pi six angl take valu point sine pi would way cosin pi find angl pi sinc cosin take x valu equal use unit circl simplifi differ exampl sine pi find angl pi look pi look sine angl take valu sinc sine that posit that equal root simplifi way well tangent pi need express trigonometr function term sine cosin know tangent equal sine cosin get sine pi divid cosin pi grab valu unit circl sine pi go angl take valu sinc sign get root cosin pi go angl take x valu sinc cosin neg root see cancel well neg tangent pi neg thing note unit circl also use find greater two pi radian angl go zero way around two pi given exampl cosin count around right cosin go get one pi right find one pi go start zero pi pi back pi end back angl pi end cosin look x valu x valu neg equal also way angl that greater pi subtract pi angl alway get right answer minu pi pi cosin cours that know equal neg either count around like pi pi subtract pi angl angl that less pi last thing want mention weve posit angl counterclockwis direct posit angl move counterclockwis get posit pi posit pi posit pi actual go encount lot well especi parametr polar curv calculu go opposit direct exampl ked find sine neg pi like instead move posit direct pi go move neg direct pi radian normal would start would move counterclockwis posit direct angl pi point right get pi well go move neg direct distanc go come hereto correspond point neg pi see neg pi equal pi sine neg pi thing sine pi four either way take sine angl look see equal neg root two two point neg angl start zero instead move clockwis neg direct distanc would move posit direct find posit version angl
