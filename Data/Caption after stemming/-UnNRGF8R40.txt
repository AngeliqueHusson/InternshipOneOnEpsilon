alright like show solv give alright gon na talk two circl relationship need look circl radiu right also call central angl call theta develop formula us find arc length well call us relationship formula arc length equal radiu time theta one stipul got make sure theta term radian give theta make sure convert way convert know ratio right convert degre guy use ratio multipli let look problem n radiu arc link plug formula equal radiu theta solv theta divid sixteen divid go point say theta equal point eight that go point eight radian measur theta right obvious could say like neg direct measur theta point eight given data one given arc length three heart length equal radiu sorri theta one time r obvious get cool three therefor radiu one gave us tous use formula clank plug radiu theta make sure theta plug valu get either arc length length arc tell radiu heart point give radiu angl exactli one right backward exactli like anoth go show guy video guy everyth yeah find sector length angl arc length formula find sector length angl arc length formula find sector length angl arc length formula find sector length angl arc length formula find sector length angl arc length formula
