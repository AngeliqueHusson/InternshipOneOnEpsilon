hi rob welcom math antic sin last basic algebra video learn learn polynomi chain term either ad togeth learn term polynomi number part variabl part togeth rememb much polynomi might want watch first video continu go even though basic polynomi pretti simpl sometim come across polynomi complic realli need math like thing complic simplifi video go learn simplifi polynomi involv identifi ing term similar enough combin singl term make polynomi shorter see work look basic polynomi follow easi recogn pattern cours last video realli need show coeffici term like x zero term also realli need show either go leav like minut illustr point see polynomi term everi degre zero four rememb polynomi miss term exampl could slightli differ polynomi third degre term make look like x cube term get skip ped miss sinc pattern goe x fourth skip x cube goe x squar well like miss term polynomi also extra like polynomi third degre term two term x cube variabl part polynomi polynomi x cube term fine polynomi one x cube term fine polynomi two x cube term also fine complic need whenev term like exact variabl combin singl term add number part keep variabl part one x cube plu one x cube combin form two x cube cal led combin like term like term term exactli variabl combin well understand like pretend variabl part polynomi term hear fruit exampl look polynomi let substitut differ kind fruit differ variabl partlet chang x cube appl x squar plain x would new fruit polynomi tell us well first term repres appl next term next term last term banana sand ad togeth get add appl appl sinc differ fruit combin sound machin left screen well unless blender middl two term get add mean combin two term singl term make fruit polynomi simpler see variabl part term exactli order combin variabl part differ like x cube x squar repres differ thing group singl term way variabl part mathemat reason work way someth cal led distribut properti subject whole video alright two term polynomi exactli variabl part call like term combin singl term simplifi polynomi help get better identifi ing like term let play littl game cal led like term like term first pair term consid like term yep variabl part term x combin singl term number part keep variabl part combin term like term first degre term sinc variabl differ letter like mean combin term two x squar neg seven x squar well variabl part exactli x squar ye like term combin notic one term neg add number part end neg combin neg five x squar next pair term four x squar six x cube like term nope even tough variabl x case expon differ variabl part next neg like term well first glanc might think variabl part term differ x differ order rememb multipl commut properti order x rewrit look add number part neg plu wind singl term five x squar five squar x care one might think like last one term differ order look close first term x squar second term squar mean even switch order expon move variabl variabl part mean like practic identifi ing like term let look complic polynomi simplifi combin like term find first exampl x squar plu six x minu x plu see term variabl part yep two term middl variabl x combin minu x would give us sinc rememb see number part term polynomi star ted term simplifi term x squar plu five x plu tri one sixteen minu two x cube plu four x minu ten polynomi degre term degre term two constant term sare constant term like term absolut realli variabl part combin easili term posit term neg add togeth end posit best think term polynomi ad coeffici either posit neg neg sign stay two x cube neg term polynomi simpl sinc like even complic polynomi three x squar plu ten minu three x plu five x squar minu four plu x polynomi six term get long polynomi like first thing look see term like term combin right away may notic two constant term polynomi posit neg let start combin singl constant term posit sinc next see also two degre term neg posit x like term combin neg plu give us neg see also two differ term variabl part x squar combin x squar plu five x squar give us eight x squar polynomi star ted six term abl simplifi three term eight x squar minu two x plu almost made algebra seem fun alright know simplifi polynomi identifi ing combin like term sit sometim littl tricki sinc complic polynomi may mani differ necessarili order degre mean may need rear rang look term combin like look pair combin combin singl term simplifi polynomi cross origin polynomi know alreadi taken care term combin come simplifi polynomi make thing easier forget treat term either posit neg depend sign right front simplifi polynomi sand know import practic simplifi ing polynomi realli understand thank watch math antic see ya next time learn algebra basic simplifi ing polynomi math antic algebra basic simplifi ing polynomi math antic
