hey everybodi pau l tutori ill show find common denomin algorithm first exampl got common denomin go case go number see could use algorithm find answer two case go set equal smaller number time number q plu number r q mani time goe r remaind result case go equal time plu goe time remaind next step remain ing step take number that posit move left hand side take remaind move number kind follow pattern way get remaind case go get rid move goe goe mani time time remaind remaind simpli look back previou remaind common denomin origin two let tri bigger exampl two set equal smaller number time number plu remaind goe time remaind move left hand side equal move four that plu four time remaind move side goe one time remaind move left hand side goe goe onetim remaind move left hand side goe one time remaind equal move move equal plu one last step left hand move goe seven time remaind simpli look back previou remaind common denomin origin two denomin number guy excel day thank watch havent alreadi dont forget subscrib find common divisor algorithm find common divisor algorithm find common divisor algorithm find common divisor algorithm find common divisor algorithm find common divisor algorithm find common divisor algorithm find common divisor algorithm find common divisor algorithm find common divisor algorithm find common divisor algorithm
