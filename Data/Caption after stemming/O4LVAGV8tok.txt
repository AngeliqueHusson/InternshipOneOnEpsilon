video go outlin two small proof deal radiu diamet graph quick recap rememb pair vertic graph distanc length shor test path take particular vertex graph take look shor test path sand look maximum that eccentr vertex final take look graph minimum that radiu maximum diamet would like quick review terminolog click link video check descript first exampl follow want g graph disconnect complement graph connect diamet two work proof let check small exampl let draw one one four vertic isol vertex three vertic realli simpl want draw vertic label want think edg origin graph disconnect take look vertex isol go adjac three vertic care side path three vertic two edg disappear complement edg goe top vertex bottom vertex put edg that edg complement let see figur diamet clearli connect graph figur eccentr vertex use tobe isol longer isol adjac three well take look vertex v middl clearli ha sa distanc one path side far take go hit take path length eccentr equal two thing goe right know equal one two particular exampl mean diamet maximum two exampl work that go ahead see prove gener gener proof take g disconnect graph sinc graph disconnect know least two connect compon rememb connect compon maxim connect sub graph graph want refresh differ word maxim maximum check video right link descript alright connect call g let draw g rest graph may bunch compon draw bunch blob mayb there one blob there could bunch want refer two set differ thing go call set vertic first connect compon think rest vertic howev ill box separ like alright wim think two piec graph observ havent drawn edg graph rememb connect compon mean edg green graph go lie within one go draw specif edg know edg blob sand that import draw edg repres complement graph go use vertex set draw edg complement differ color edg graph g within green want take vertex let call u set that set vertic first connect compon think think vertic set clearli edg graph g vertex connect weve said g lie within recap everi vertex v v edg u v graph g mean edg graph g bar complement let draw gener ill use color pink rememb color pink go repres complement graph obvious take look complement graph g lot go occur look particular green blob pair vertic adjac longer vice werent adjac dont realli need worri rest blob what realli import happen first love talk rest v v far weve alreadi observ vertex u vertex v adjac vertex v set v distanc equal complement graph know distanc vertic set v big set v vertic could belong one side let consid case take two vertic v v big set v may differ green blob origin graph dont care think connect complement graph may edg mayb mayb dont sure edg vertex u back distanc two could one definit two next consid two vertic u u set v want also show connect path length may connect previous may may edg know sinc one side graph pink edg go side graph mean si follow pink edg one side vertex back one u u vertic complement graph vertic distanc away consid everi possibl pair vertic alway found distanc mean take maximum diamet almost conclud proof next exampl go show given graph center connect graph rememb center set vertic whose eccentr equal radiu that exactli statement mathemat notat think might proof go like start given graph g want build new graph let call h start given graph g ill draw big blob want add two new vertic let call u next want add bunch edg want add everi edg u everi vertex g edg everi vertex g definit connect graph even g previous disconnect vertex g back one back vertex g complet connect graph point let draw edg gener pink quit done want add two call v v v v add edg though go add edg v u edg two big graph call h connect graph claim g center order see look let start look farthest think care eccentr exampl obvious get one go one edg vertex graph h one five path length two get one final one furthest possibl vertex away b vertex v hope that clear similarli eccentr vertex v also symmetr next well look vertex u obvious distanc v that fine farthest vertex away vertex v that distanc check eccentr vertex thing goe vertex u symmetri final let take look vertic x x vertex origin graph g pair vertic origin graph g may may weve ad vertic u u know get path length dont know that go tobe worst possibl case vertic v v sure path length vertex x graph g vertex b that worst case know eccentr vertic x equal mean us radiu graph new graph fact diamet vertic neither center peripheri that fine final know center new graph equal set vertic eccentr equal radiu case exactli vertic graph g weve proven exactli wan ted weve shown gener graph defin tobe center connect
