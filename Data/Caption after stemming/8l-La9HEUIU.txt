let start algebra nice simpl equat like x plu equal cours hard solv equat get x equal equat whole number sand solv whole pretti soon write equat cant solv whole equat x plu there whole number solut xi would need minu that x equal minu need introduc neg that good might face equat like plu equal need well keep go equat begin wonder didnt multipli get polynomi equat polynomi someth like constant time x n plu anoth number time x n minu plu blab la b la equat got power right theyr realli function function f x talk could solv equat equat need equal sign f x equal equat talk solut function f x talk root function that thing solut habit altern talk root sand solut dont want confus anybodi let look equat x squar minu x could plu that solut there anoth solut minu polynomi equat though easi find solut instanc simpl one would x squar equal there ration number equat that someth discov consid adeep philosoph mysteri cours write x equal squar root there anoth one believ there squar root sure believ there minu squar root that anoth solut two solut pretti nice could go way unfortun quickli hit dont solut someth like x squar plu real number put real number x alway posit squar add even posit never get point begin nice begin graph ing equat instanc f x x squar plu get valu put x exampl would id somewher everybodi probabl seen parabola doesnt root sit doesnt valu x make valu f x see pictur solut would place graph cross x axi line function root equat solut graph function cross like electr fenc magic special magic law magic line right one kind polynomi equat alway root that case f degre everi polynomi case expon highest power polynomi odd degre well one even degre turn way didnt root let take one odd degre took instanc function f x equal x well f x cours odd degre graph straight line goe origin see solut x could could say f x equal x mayb x squar time x minu look like well see way wrote f x equal x equal one x equal graph go look turn someth like ill explain knew see root see there realli robust root one ill sort almost id move littl bit wouldnt root instanc put minu whole pictur would move one would still root realli robust pictur somehow that there theorem behind love write word theorem especi prove theyr write polynomi mean odd degre that coeffici graze polynomi polynomi odd degre that right begin someth fifth plu seven x fourth plu someth els odd least one real root odd expon go key that right go show there x plug give zero answer that pretti amaz say know littl piec polynomi anyway proof realli think go graph polynomi might ask graph polynomi dont know anyth go anyway go assum posit sake argument make make one pictur would exactli correspond pictur neg want find valu x zero cours place graph cross x axi x axi realli graph equal zero magic point axi want get ask zero take equal seven goal could exactli proof would want graph well unfortun dont even know start graph function know littl know one thing posit number odd power posit neg number odd power neg number make absolut valu number realli realli big get realli realli big number number posit realli realli realli posit number neg realli realli neg let say b cand constant bound someth anyway take x hundr time big biggest constant x expon sake argument x fifth power hundr time x fourth power extra time x first term enorm ly anyth els fact graph function wont even see influenc term scale tri draw basic first term go domin go import term least approxim especi x larg think first term cours x small bet cant say thing x larg understand take x larg let take x hundr time ill pretend hundr sake argument big x big x x big go say absolut x big way mathematician would write absolut x much bigger zero minu good x big x hundr x posit power much bigger expon hundr plu one that big go draw think axi differ scale x axi point put confid dont know exactli pretti close way right take x reason get enorm absolut valu x fifth x plu n odd ill get enorm neg valu first point proof say someth way second point proof two graph afunct like cal led continu function drawn without lift pencil go start draw dont know graph realli goe go draw goe somehow get point oh gosh cross x axi get well right cross that root equat goe somehow idea realli root might left might right order get hereto without lift pencil simpli draw line cant walk canada without go us right cours could swim around mayb could dig tunnel might littl worri realli know wasnt littl tunnel place mayb real like sea let red thing well that realli basic point real wasnt complet understood think nineteenth centuri decid think took instanc suppos said dont know real ration said wouldnt work exampl x cube minu real odd degre polynomi that line would slip ration there ration number squar root cube enough youd add work know hole one great mathemat that due debt definit real term nice even though might alreadi convinc there real go draw ration like lot ration theyr also lot hole weve seen idea whata real number realli way divid ration let say go tobe real number hey e tic said realli set ration less togeth ration greater two set tell reason left whole would find would defin number two ration number greater number hole exist way realli funni term realli trick say definit avid left side bodi plu right side bodi wors say that space left togeth space right littl tell real number that sit exist kind proof realli construct sort thing peopl studi mayb junior year cours mathemat philosophi cut realli import idea want graph function want happen buy x want find point convinc point blue point go zero red side odd
