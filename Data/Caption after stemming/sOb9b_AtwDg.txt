rang easi calcul unfortun data make rang almost useless goback origin question measur spread apart data without kind suscept outlier problem least reduc sensit outlier problem answer question someth extrem import statist concept varianc that concept varianc right done rang figur go tri calcul someth cal led varianc go tell us spread apart data way that quit suscept outlier that import concept varianc go tell right along standard deviat well get littl bit concept varianc never go leav statist realli need make sure like understand mean import understand varianc extrem import instead equat varianc could done go lead logic kind mean know equat varianc also know gut realli mean that realli need think that realli need intern let say data set kind draw pictur could list could height peopl room could age peopl could know like peanut butter jelli oh doesnt realli matter usual numer data kind sake argument think peopl room someth like weve learn cours sofar bunch data calcul mean kind like valu right kind like repres number kind goe cut right middl data set center graviti speak data set use notat talk data right sampl mean way get add valu sampl divid number sampl get number repres sampl right wan ted look data point visual cloud bunch data point know got data point differ valu kind mean wan ted look individu data point figur far mean kind measur spread individu data point right rememb tri tri figur spread data instead rang end point want look everi singl data point set figur far away mean somehow roll calcul calcul varianc spread data go examin one point one point right would find point data point deviat simpl noth complic data valu minu mean mean that simpl right word data point want figur mean like want figur deviat mean data point go subtract take data point go subtract away mean that go give far away got data point mean well go take go subtract tell far away point might think look individu data mean nice indic spread data would would right way might roll one calcul might want add littl mean everi singl data point set see say x sub instead scare need think x sub ice data point mayb five data point sub one sub two said three four five individu see someth like x sub minu averag valu mean x bar take everi data mean get number everi singl data point mean get add that sigma add add data point divid number data point weve realli done weve point go say incred import right weve done weve taken everi data point subtract mean give us deviat everi point set mean add divid number point deviat mean get averag valu nice way averag know varianc call mean give us spread data look like rang look everi point find far away mean get differ point equal weight get number tell us get realli big number tell us yeah lot far away mean get realli small number calcul tell us yeah kind close mean deviat realli small that right let write coupl go kind put page theav rage right final answer realli want calcul varianc there one big problem thought process what import go make one chang well done problem notic data left hand side main data right hand side main go definit kind like center data set calcul valu kind like center graviti data center kind there point there point that alway way mean right calcul written data point minu mean data point mean five data point greater five one data point might minu five anoth data point might ten minu five anoth data point might may know six minu five may twelv minu five could lot mean alway subtract ing data valu minu mean right look side mean data point actual smaller mean actual calcul go point minu mean five data point smaller five could three minu two minu five four minu five minu minu five four go get neg number top small number minu big number problem calcul even though perfect sens us half data point go give us neg valu top half data point go us posit valu top sinc togeth half data point go neg deviat half point go posit deviat sum togeth go alway get want want find number spread data although make perfect logic sens subtract ing mean mean alway alway go get neg valu son top along posit valu sand alway go end calcul cut chase go make small model vacat go call varianc ill explain minut cal led varianc right exactli written sigma x averag valu mean divid capit everyth exactli make one chang squar guy right call varianc fact go write popul varianc go circl import popul varianc someth core know statist concept realli like studi ing algebra learn x well statist learn varianc absolut fundament central everyth go everyth follow need make sure understand weve done weve done exactli calcul logic spent lot time explain true thing take sampl valu minu get number squar get deviat mean squar data point mean five might six minu five seven month five eight ten minu five squar differ right hand side get posit deviat go squar theyr go get bigger left hand side neg issu pop know minu know minu would get neg valu squar squar action make posit get deviat point mean squar squar first right fact might even make sens want could put littl bracket around like kind show squar action done addit everi data point subtract mean squar everi data point add problem half neg valu half posit nowher lead zero matter data point alway go get posit valu top divid pot number still thing squar first get around whole neg issu tal ked cal led varianc symbol actual sigma let sigma also sigma letter cal led sigma letter sigma reason squar us measur deviat call varianc case varianc varianc squar that squar remind tell calcul anyth remind actual model varianc data fall around mean spread apart weve kind actual differ weve squar everyth didnt get zero answer common book see sigma squar place see sig symbol book asquar like need mental head oh spread data bigger number whatev spread data smaller number closer data pac ked say closer pac ked mean closer pac ked around mean say farther spread apart farther spread apart mean right one thing want say close popul varianc popul mean data point popul that popul varianc right dont forget busi take sampl right sampl probabl never go know popul go know rial take sampl mani time arriv squar choos differ symbol right sampl varianc told long time ago need understand differ sampl popul reason exactli thing n minu right cal led sampl varianc notic there one major differ there two sampl spread apart taken sampl mean right sampl mean x bar calcul reason n bottom number minu that convent reason minu goe way beyond scope class need rememb sampl finit set sampl n minu bottom calcul entir popul dispos reason knew data point sin popul would divid n total number peopl popul one thing need modifi descript sho wed stuff tri kind make realli clear sinc popul varianc instead x bar better way write way would see book minu mu right sinc popul varianc rememb popul popul mean call mu sampl mean call import thing lesson want tri intern tri understand follow next lesson go work actual tri calcul varianc import thing know data go certain amount dispers spread right talk spread realli care spread apart mean that realli care right sampl actual data youv gone collect sampl mean know calcul differ everi data point sampl mean squar divid number minu one give us someth squar notic sampl varianc goe sampl see squar know varianc youv taken right that calcul popul everybodi knew actual popul mean knew everi singl data point popul like everi person unit could calcul popul varianc sigma squar calcul similar popul case divid number peopl popul sampl case divid sampl minu one fundament sort import thing need know see sigma squar like guy need think popul varianc talk popul see squar like need think theyr talk sampl weve taken that took much make sure understand differ sampl popul sampl mean popul mean case calcul actual
