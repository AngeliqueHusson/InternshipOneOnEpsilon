straight edg except mark straight edg straight edg ruler compass use draw edg follow two point plane previous somehow given youthen put straight edg connect fine straight line way imagin straight line infinit long paper infinit big ca n line twenti centimet well sort good question hum given line one centimet know god line twenti centimet draw one long line line one c given use compass measur pick start point infinit long line put c twenti time three time one central question peopl interest long time exactli length construct given line segment one centimet one inch one unit today start learn mathemat even two year old three year old alway start peopl time opposit thought geometri basi everyth thought point triangl fundament object sand thought someth aris geometri question natur ask littl bit differ first show thing possibl give line segment length ask construct perpendicular bisector mean line perpendicular line segment cut two equal piec open compass quit wide drew long line segment draw one circl arc two circl arc import part width radiu circl width compass left right take straight edg connect two point arc intersect intersect compass wide enough half line perpendicular bisector wo n show mayb wo n show proof show connect point shape well red radiu circl length kept compass width whole time shape cal led rhombu one rhombu two diagon perpendicular cut half anoth thing angl n know big ca n measur n angl measur devic whatev bisector mean construct line right middl take compass open whatev width n matter draw circl arc circl arc intersect two draw anoth two circl arc two radiu two intersect draw line line bisect angl let show one last trick possibl suppos given unit squar tell everi side length ask whether doubl squar mean construct squar twice area go well want squar twice area area squar one one get area squar multipli side area one twice area area mean know x squar know x squar root construct squar doubl size come construct segment length squar root kind question start look like kind line segment length quit kind question squar twice big come question kind question line segment length root line long ye draw line want line perpendicular pretti much anywher one way know construct perpendicular pick two point n matter construct perpendicular bisector littl line segment perpendicular line forget happen take compass given unit segment key know know happen put mark guess next yeah hypotenus exactli hypotenus use theorem c c squar equal plu c squar equal c equal root finish job well would make squar side length let make bit longer want perpendicular perpendicular know perpendicular draw circl arc draw anoth circl arc k believ side well ye three side squar measur side put length measur side measur side squar well done job done yeah doubl squar question tri tripl squar u h u h similar involv littl bit extra trickeri fun problem think first thing sho wed u h bisect segment instead bisect segment could ask trisect segment cut segment three equal part oppos two equal part answer still ye actual pretti wo n like perpendicular properli caus believ construct short cut way open compass length want put anoth line start point line segment angl n matter whatsoev put compass end measur whatev length n matter one time two time three time side line segment trisect line connect two end sand point draw parallel red n thaught draw parallel parallel perpendicular perpendicular would would draw perpendicular red line would construct perpendicular point hum would parallel anoth one magic intersect trisect origin next thing next natur question sho wed bisect angl trisect angl give angl dont know measur caus n measur devic come construct would result two divid angl three equal part base everyth sho wed far would said ye well could n two thousand year peopl thought problem tell answer let give anoth problem told tripl squar one kind gener problem doubl squar hum go ratio want multipli could also tri go dimens squar thing instead doubl squar ask doubl cube mean well given unit cube need cube whose side length want tri figur construct anoth cube twice volum volum unit cube one one get volum cube multipli side length side length side length cube time time doubl volum new one would n know side length figur side length know volum time time get get cube root equal cube root cube root cube root compass straight edg well know could n peopl thought two thousand year problem could n crack could n crack peopl curiou mani mani smart peopl earli eighteen hundr came along ingeni guy cal led die age nineteen duel essenti revolution algebra nineteen nineteen yeah waw theori theori came math program univers thaught year say fourth year undergradu first year graduat hope also teach duel gave peopl tool eventu problem sand well solv proven eighteen imposs guy prove cal led pier see much harder someth solvabl need come solut solut still tricki hard solv someth imposs that prove someth imposs hard ca n know say thought ten year could n proof mayb smart enough come someth explicit prove absolut imposs came kind question ie kind length construct given unit segment exampl show squar sho wed sho wed turn involv fraction squar root addit problem cube root guy prove never abl cube root sand also use crack problem trisect ing angl somehow come cube root trigonometri cube root problem cube root big problem question aris prove ca n cube root prove ca n cube root good question use translat geometri main question answer analyt geometri probabl high school alway start unit segment somehow unit segment alway given begin want construct stuff translat everyth question start unit segment construct system unit segment length point construct start cube root like island get exactli question think instead point exactli construct ask point construct basic step told basic step like draw line two point draw circl news point pour intersect intersect circl sand might rememb high school solv intersect ing thing come equat sand equat come equat equat circl u h also might rememb high school calculu ever took calculu equat line linear equat equat circl quadrat equat solv never go get cube
