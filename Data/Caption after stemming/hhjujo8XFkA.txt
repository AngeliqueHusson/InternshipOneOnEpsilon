want find line that perpendicular mean right angl segment cut gon na go take compass basic compass want make sure two point come togeth dont like theyr go want come togeth end gon na want want make sure open halfway less halfway gon na issu want make sure open halfway doesnt exact gon na go make arc segment segment like want student make continu arc like like separ two arc go go like theyr two arc let make got correct weve got arc gon na rotat paper like go make anoth arc go use use two point draw two point intersect right right that go perpendicular bisector see that right angl degre see cut segment half construct perpendicular bisector ill see next video construct perpendicular bisector geometri construct perpendicular bisector geometri
