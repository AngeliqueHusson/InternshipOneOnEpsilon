well welcom video go second half lesson recal first half lesson take equat standard form get form find polynomi lesson work way backward gon na start form expand standard form polynomi see origin equat would would graph would give us root polynomi standard form go requir littl bit work littl bit algebra multipli polynomi togeth want make sure patienc realli difficult let jump thing look exampl exampl gon na look write polynomi know look exampl though realli import factor theorem x minu r factor polynomi long r zero give us neg write factor x minu rememb minu neg becom posit first one x minu neg x plu that one polynomi factor theorem x minu would also factor polynomi aswel x minu set factor equal zero wed end get neg goal equat standard form gon na go multipli togeth use method choos person like box method x box method box method creat box gon na set factor snow doesnt matter two multipli first want put x plu x minu want first could put outsid box gon na multipli togeth get standard form coupl part cant multipli three mean way could get realli think think easi two separ part multipli togeth multipli x time x get x squar x time would posit neg time x neg x neg time neg multipli first two end x squar neg neg minu x still multipli time x minu box that grid side that got go two term x minu side three column x squar minu x minu multipli togeth get would minu x squar would minu x x squar would plu x would posit combin like term get final answer standard form x x cube stay minu squar minu x squar though combin x squar neg x plu x neg plu equat say would cube minu squar minu that start key start form form multipli get answer standard form let start look next one togeth ill multipli togeth one zero well put form x minu x would x plu would x minu multipli order want want multipli two binomi togeth first distribut x first binomi multipli two togeth doesnt matter person might want multipli two binomi togeth dont know whatev choos dont paus video hit play readi check see correct answer end end multipli togeth x plu time x minu distribut want first binomi x plu dont binomi otherwis end wrong answer multipli togeth end x squar posit get neg x neg combin like term get x squar minu x minu dont forget multipli everyth x get polynomi equal x cube minu x squar minu hope got answer time instead given us theyr go instead give us graph mayb graph equat calcul find either way graph see cross x axi root thing let start neg neg posit next want put form form go use factor theorem x minu neg x plu x minu neg x plu wed x minu neg becom x plu final would x minu multipli togeth could either left right wan ted person would group pair first mayb multipli first two last two notic one two conjug rememb multipli two conjug someth signific happen let look forgot want set box rememb happen go ahead jump short cut youv got happen want follow special uniqu conjug x plu x minu multipli get x squar x neg x get neg notic minu multipli two togeth get x squar minu still want multipli still x plu x plu still gon na multipli togeth let actual next gon na take ill gon na multipli togeth well take x plu put outsid box x want put outsid oh way go back didnt recogn short cut multipli first term last get answer x time x x squar time neg neg work conjug multipli way get x squar posit x would get combin dont forget x squar minu multipli combin like term get x squar x togeth make x plu still finish yet multipli two togeth gon na multipli set grid x squar minu x squar plu plu put multipli togeth get x fourth cube squar squar neg x neg combin like term get final answer equal x fourth got care combin like term might habit think alway like term there x cube stay x cube six x squar minu four x squar like term togeth two x squar x doesnt like term neither would final answer kind along process noth realli difficult though dont guy take coupl minut want guy work one hear count see littl bit easier way assum x axi point kind hard see integ x intercept want guy figur four x intercept gon na use find form write answer standard form paus video hit play readi check see correct answer let see first step want find look hope loo ked correctli could thrown entir answer get wrong would neg form would x minu could put x front middl doesnt matter though would write could x plu x minu x minu order go multipli togeth two part multipli get two part get final answer x time x plu give x squar plu part go end get outsid box put get x squar minu minu x plu combin like term get x squar minu x plu go multipli togeth set two three buy get x fourth minu x cube plu x x x squar gon na get rather larg get cube x squar plu x combin like term get answer x fourth minu x x squar plu x well lesson rememb first part took equat standard form form find part lesson gave us got
