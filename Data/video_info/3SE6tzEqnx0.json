The diagonals of a rhombus are perpendicular and bisect the angles of the rhombus. The midpoint of the hypotenuse of a right triangle is equidistant from the three vertices. Students are then asked to solve problems related to these concepts using Algebra.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3SE6tzEqnx0/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3SE6tzEqnx0/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3SE6tzEqnx0/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "channelTitle": "MathHelp.com", "tags": ["properties", "rhombuses", "diagonal", "diagonals", "quadrilateral", "quadrilaterals"], "categoryId": "27", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "localized": {"title": "Properties of a Rhombus - MathHelp.com - Geometry Help", "description": "For a complete lesson on rhombuses, go to http://www.MathHelp.com - 1000+ online math lessons featuring a personal math teacher inside every lesson!
