For more MashUp Math content, visit http://www.mashupmath.com and join our free mailing list! :)\n\nThis lesson answers the questions: What is SAS? What is ASA? What is the difference between SAS and ASA? How do I prove that two triangles are congruent?\n\nOur lessons are perfect for flipped classroom math teachers and students. This lesson is aligned with the common core learning standards for math and the SAT math curriculum as well.\n\nBe sure to join our mailing list at http://www.mashupmath.com", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qmeW-vwrVRo/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qmeW-vwrVRo/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qmeW-vwrVRo/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qmeW-vwrVRo/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qmeW-vwrVRo/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "channelTitle": "MashUp Math", "tags": ["math", "geometry", "algebra", "lesson", "common core", "free", "homeschool", "teacher", "student", "SAS", "side angle side", "ASA", "angle side angle", "triangle", "congruence", "congruent", "theorem", "theorems", "compare", "difference between", "what is", "proofs", "sum", "product", "factor", "flip", "flipped", "blended", "learning", "classroom", "summer school", "ideas", "enrichment", "visual learner", "help", "prove", "khan", "yt:quality=high", "example", "practice", "activity", "triangle proofs"], "categoryId": "27", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "localized": {"title": "☆ TRIANGLE PROOFS: SAS or ASA?", "description": "Join us on this flipped math lesson where we visually compare the difference between the SAS and ASA triangle congruence theorems.
