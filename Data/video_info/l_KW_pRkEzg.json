In this lesson, students learn that the formula for the volume of a cylinder is pi times radius squared times height, so the volume of a cylinder that has a radius of 10 feet and a height of 40 feet is pi times 10 squared times 40, or pi times 100 times 40, or 4000 pi cubic feet. And since pi = 3.14, 4000 pi cubic feet can also be written as 4000 times 3.14, or 12,560 cubic feet. Students also learn that the formula for the volume of a sphere is 4/3 times pi times radius cubed, and the formula for the volume of a cone is 1/3 times pi times radius squared times height.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/l_KW_pRkEzg/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/l_KW_pRkEzg/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/l_KW_pRkEzg/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "channelTitle": "MathHelp.com", "tags": ["Volume", "of", "Cone", "Calculating", "cone", "volume", "formula", "calculation", "equation", "geometry", "pre", "algebra"], "categoryId": "27", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "localized": {"title": "Volume of a Cone - MathHelp.com - Math Help", "description": "For a complete lesson on volume of a cone, go to http://www.MathHelp.com - 1000+ online math lessons featuring a personal math teacher inside every lesson!
