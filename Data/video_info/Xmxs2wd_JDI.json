In this lesson, students learn that two fractions are equivalent if the fractions are the same when they are written in lowest terms. For example, 4/7 and 8/14 are equivalent fractions, because they are both equal to 4/7 when written in lowest terms. Students also learn to find fractions that are equivalent to a given fraction by multiplying the numerator and denominator of the given fraction by the same number. For example, to find fractions that are equivalent to 1/8, multiply the numerator and denominator by 2, to get 2/16, multiply the numerator and denominator by 3, to get 3/24, and so on.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Xmxs2wd_JDI/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Xmxs2wd_JDI/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Xmxs2wd_JDI/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "channelTitle": "MathHelp.com", "tags": ["equivalent", "fraction", "fractions", "teaching", "lesson", "how", "to", "do", "finding", "chart", "worksheets", "worksheet", "games"], "categoryId": "27", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "localized": {"title": "Equivalent Fractions - MathHelp.com - Math Help", "description": "For a complete lesson on equivalent fractions, go to http://www.MathHelp.com - 1000+ online math lessons featuring a personal math teacher inside every lesson!
