The flipped classroom lesson is for Algebra I students and is aligned with the common core learning standards for math. \n\nThis lesson answers the following questions: What is a quadratic function? What does a quadratic function look like? What is a quadratic equation? How do I find the vertex of a parabola? How do I find axis of symmetry? How do I find x and y intercepts of a function?\n\nAll of our lessons are perfect for flipped classroom math teachers and students. This lesson is aligned with the common core math learning standards for Algebra.\n\nBe sure to join our mailing list at http://www.mashupmath.com", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gGf7kFBzC48/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gGf7kFBzC48/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gGf7kFBzC48/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gGf7kFBzC48/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gGf7kFBzC48/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "channelTitle": "MashUp Math", "tags": ["math", "geometry", "algebra", "lesson", "common core", "free", "homeschool", "teacher", "student", "graph", "graphing", "calculator", "without", "using", "parabola", "table of values", "axis of symmetry", "coordinates", "linear function", "y-intercept", "vertex", "turning point", "flipped", "learning", "classroom", "blended", "khan", "graphing calculator", "x-intercepts", "zeros", "factors", "idea", "real world", "Graph Of A Function", "Quadratic Equation (Literature Subject)", "Common Core State Standards Initiative", "School"], "categoryId": "27", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "localized": {"title": "☆ How to Graph a Quadratic Function Without a Calculator | Common Core Algebra I", "description": "Join us on this lesson where we visually explore how to graph a quadratic function without using a graphing calculator.
