Then I show another method which works well for polygons in the coordinate grid. You draw a rectangle AROUND the polygon. Then you figure out the areas of the right triangles that are between the actual polygon and the surrounding rectangle, and subtract the areas of those from the area of the rectangle.\n\nLastly in this lesson we calculate the area of a trapezoid... not by using the formula, but by dividing it into two triangles and a rectangle. Nothing difficult there, but the main point we learn that it is SO very IMPORTANT to keep track of and record your intermediate calculations. :)\n\nThis geometry lesson is intended for 6th grade math.\n\nCheck out also my geometry worktext -- available both as a digital download and a printed copy:\nhttp://www.mathmammoth.com/geometry_2.php", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RCHe6fCHMuU/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RCHe6fCHMuU/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RCHe6fCHMuU/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RCHe6fCHMuU/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "channelTitle": "Math Mammoth", "tags": ["area", "polygon", "quadrilateral", "trapezoid", "grid", "triangle", "6th grade", "math", "geometry"], "categoryId": "27", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "defaultLanguage": "en", "localized": {"title": "Area of polygons, including in a grid", "description": "The basic principle for calculating the area of polygons, such as pentagons, hexagons, heptagons, and so on, is to divide the polygon into triangles (or other simple shapes), figure out the areas of those, and add them.\n\nWe do that for one quadrilateral.
