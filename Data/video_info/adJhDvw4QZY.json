For example, we might be interested in how fast the top of a ladder is sliding down a wall compared to how fast the bottom of the ladder is sliding away from the wall.\n\nRelated rates problems allow us to do that by using implicit differentiation. We'll usually take the derivative of the equation, taking the derivative of every variable with respect to time t.

You need to figure out what equation you can write that will include the value you need to solve for. In addition to that, you may have to come up with a second equation that will give you the value for a missing variable that you need to plug into your first equation.\n\n● ● ● GET EXTRA HELP ● ● ●\n\nIf you could use some extra help with your math class, then check out Krista’s website // http://www.kristakingmath.com\n\n● ● ● CONNECT WITH KRISTA ● ● ●\n\nHi, I’m Krista! I make math courses to keep you from banging your head against the wall. ;)\n\nMath class was always so frustrating for me. I’d go to a class, spend hours on homework, and three days later have an “Ah-ha!” moment about how the problems worked that could have slashed my homework time in half. I’d think, “WHY didn’t my teacher just tell me this in the first place?!”\n\nSo I started tutoring to keep other people out of the same aggravating, time-sucking cycle. Since then, I’ve recorded tons of videos and written out cheat-sheet style notes and formula sheets to help every math student—from basic middle school classes to advanced college calculus—figure out what’s going on, understand the important concepts, and pass their classes, once and for all.
