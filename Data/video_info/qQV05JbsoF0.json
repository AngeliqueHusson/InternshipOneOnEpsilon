We also explore why the commutative property does not apply to subtraction and division.\n\nGet the PDF Lesson Guide Here: http://mashupmath.com/resources/\n\nThis lesson answers the questions: What is the commutative property of real numbers? What is the difference between the associative property and the commutative property? What is a real number? How does the commutative property apply to algebraic expressions and equations?\n\nOur lessons are perfect for flipped classroom math teachers and students and for warm-up and exit ticket activities . This lesson is aligned with the common core math learning standards for math and the SAT math curriculum as well.\n\nBe sure to join our mailing list at http://www.mashupmath.com", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qQV05JbsoF0/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qQV05JbsoF0/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qQV05JbsoF0/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qQV05JbsoF0/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qQV05JbsoF0/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "channelTitle": "MashUp Math", "tags": ["math", "homeschool", "real numbers", "commutative", "property", "algebra", "middleschool", "teacher", "common core", "flipped classroom", "free", "lesson", "Real Number", "Commutative Property", "School", "Lessons", "Education", "geometry", "how do I", "what is the", "yt:quality-high", "math help", "practice", "exit ticket", "warm up", "activity", "khan", "Learn", "idea", "properties", "example"], "categoryId": "22", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "localized": {"title": "☆ THE COMMUTATIVE PROPERTY OF REAL NUMBERS!", "description": "Join us on this common core flipped math lesson where explore the commutative property of addition and multiplication.
