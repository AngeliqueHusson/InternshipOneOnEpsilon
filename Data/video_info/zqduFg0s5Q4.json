That's awesome! In 3rd grade math we want you to start using bigger numbers and start multiplying and dividing, too. By the way, did you know that some numbers aren’t actually “whole?” They’re “partially whole.” We call them fractions! We want you to start playing around and having fun with those, too. There's also area, perimeter, and place value to be discovered. Whew. We have so much to do and can't wait to do it with you. Let's go!\n\nAbout Khan Academy: Khan Academy offers practice exercises, instructional videos, and a personalized learning dashboard that empower learners to study at their own pace in and outside of the classroom. We tackle math, science, computer programming, history, art history, economics, and more. Our math missions guide learners from kindergarten to calculus using state-of-the-art, adaptive technology that identifies strengths and learning gaps. We've also partnered with institutions like NASA, The Museum of Modern Art, The California Academy of Sciences, and MIT to offer specialized content.\n\nFor free. For everyone.
