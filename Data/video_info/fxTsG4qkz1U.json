Students learn that the formula for the volume of a cylinder is pi times radius squared times height, so the volume of a cylinder that has a radius of 10 feet and a height of 40 feet is pi times 10 squared times 40, or pi times 100 times 40, or 4000 pi cubic feet. And since pi = 3.14, 4000 pi cubic feet can also be written as 4000 times 3.14, or 12,560 cubic feet. Students also learn that the formula for the volume of a sphere is 4/3 times pi times radius cubed, and the formula for the volume of a cone is 1/3 times pi times radius squared times height.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fxTsG4qkz1U/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fxTsG4qkz1U/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fxTsG4qkz1U/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fxTsG4qkz1U/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fxTsG4qkz1U/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "channelTitle": "MathHelp.com", "tags": ["volume", "of", "cylinder", "cylinders", "finding", "find", "the", "how", "to", "do", "you", "calculating", "calculate", "formula", "for", "equation", "circular", "radius", "area", "and"], "categoryId": "27", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "localized": {"title": "Volume of a Cylinder | MathHelp.com", "description": "Need a custom math course?
