This easy to learn technique will have you calculating the square of numbers up to 100 - without the need for a calculator.\nThe trick is easy - first we find the distance from the number being squared to the nearest tens number.    Say for example we are trying to find the square of 23 - the nearest tens number is 20, which is 3 away from 23.  So 3 is our result!\nWe use this number to find the square - by taking this number from the number being squared (23 - 3 = 20) and then adding this number to the number being squared (23 + 3 = 26).   We easily multiply these two numbers (20 x 26 = 520).\nTo this we add our distance number squared (3 x 3 = 9).  So we add 9 to 520...our answer is 529.\nLove the math!\nThe old math is dead!  Long live the math!
