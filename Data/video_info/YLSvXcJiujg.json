Visit http://www.MathHelp.com.\n\nThis lesson covers equivalent ratios. Students learn to find equal ratios by first writing the given ratio as a fraction, then multiplying the numerator and denominator of the fraction by the same number. For example, to find two ratios that are equal to 1:7, first write 1:7 as the fraction 1/7. Next, multiply both the numerator and denominator of 1/7 by 2, to get 2/14, or 2:14, and multiply the numerator and denominator of 1/7 by 3, to get 3/21, or 3:21. So 2:14 and 3:21 are two ratios that are equal to 1:7. Students are also asked to determine whether two given ratios are equal, by first writing each ratio as a fraction, then writing each fraction in lowest terms. If the two fractions are the same when written in lowest terms, then the ratios are equal.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YLSvXcJiujg/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YLSvXcJiujg/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YLSvXcJiujg/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YLSvXcJiujg/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YLSvXcJiujg/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "channelTitle": "MathHelp.com", "tags": ["equivalent", "ratios", "ratio", "finding", "find", "how", "to", "do", "you", "equal", "two"], "categoryId": "27", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "localized": {"title": "Equivalent Ratios | MathHelp.com", "description": "Need a custom math course?
