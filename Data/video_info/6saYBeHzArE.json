For more MashUp Math content, visit http://www.mashupmath.com and join our free mailing list! :)\n\nThis lesson answers the questions: How can I prove that two triangles are congruent? How can I complete a geometry proof? How do I prove vertical angles are congruent? How do I use CPCTC? How can I study geometry proofs?\n\nOur lessons are perfect for flipped classroom math teachers and students. This lesson is aligned with the geometry common core learning standards for math and the SAT math curriculum as well.\n\nBe sure to join our mailing list at http://www.mashupmath.com\n\nSubscribe to Our Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtBt...", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6saYBeHzArE/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6saYBeHzArE/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6saYBeHzArE/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6saYBeHzArE/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6saYBeHzArE/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "channelTitle": "MashUp Math", "tags": ["yt:quality=high", "khan", "common core", "learning standards", "ccls", "flip", "flipped", "learning", "classroom", "edtech", "elearning", "blended learning", "education", "math", "maths", "geometry", "practice", "proofs", "sss", "sas", "asa", "aas", "hl", "cpctc", "statements", "reasons", "isosceles", "help", "how do I", "given", "vertical angles", "prove", "congruent sides", "line segment"], "categoryId": "27", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "localized": {"title": "☆ Practice with Geometry Proofs | Congruent Triangles & CPCTC", "description": "After this lesson, check out our newest video upload: \"✪ Comparing Equivalent Fractions | 4th Grade Fractions\" \n&rarr; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nwsx-CsDLsc\n-~-~~-~~~-~~-~-\n\nJoin us on this flipped math lesson where we visually explore and practice proving two triangles or parts of triangles are congruent by using a formal proof.
