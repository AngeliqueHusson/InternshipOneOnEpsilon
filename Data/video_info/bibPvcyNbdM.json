So, in the following diagram which is here, the radius of the triangle is 24 centimeters, right? And we know the angle B, D, and C. That's this angle right here, is 75 degrees. So, we're trying to figure out the angle BAC, which is right over here. So, that's the missing angle that you're trying to figure out, okay? \n \nNow, there's a relationship between this angle and this angle. Now, the angle 75 is called the central angle. The central angle is called the C, for example, okay? And the inscribed angle of that central angle is only just half of that, okay? So, it's equal to the inscribed angle but you need to put a two times right there, okay? \n\nSo, basically the central angle is double, double of the inscribed angle. Now, how do you know that one is really an inscribed while the other is the center? Well, the central angle is always from a point and then the other point, and they form with the center line, okay? The center point, okay? So, this is your central angle right here. \n \nNow, if you start and finish with the same points, which is B and C, and you form any triangle around your circle right here, those are called your inscribed angles, okay? Or they have the same arc lengths. You can actually look at the arc lengths right here. This is the arc length of the triangles, right? \n\nSo, as long as they share the same arc length. Doesn't have to start from here to here. It could be somewhere else. As long as the arc length, the A-R-C, is the same. Therefore, this equation right here will exist, okay? The central angle is the double of the inscribed angle. So, if that's 75 over here, then, basically it's just two times the missing angle. Which is, let me put down. . .\n \n75 degrees and there's your two theta that's missing, okay? So, just grab your calculator and take the 75 divided by two, you get yourself the angle, which is this one right here, the BAC will just be 37.5 degrees. And that's your final answer for this question.
