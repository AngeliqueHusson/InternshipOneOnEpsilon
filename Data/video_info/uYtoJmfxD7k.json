In this lesson, students learn the definitions of a segment, a ray, and length, as well as the symbols that are used in Geometry to represent each figure. Students also learn the definitions of an endpoint, opposite rays, a coordinate, and a number line. Students are then given geometric figures that are composed of segments and rays, and are asked true/ false questions about the given figures. Students are also given number lines, and are asked short answer questions about the given number lines. Students are also given the coordinates of the endpoints of segments, and are asked to find the segment lengths.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uYtoJmfxD7k/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uYtoJmfxD7k/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uYtoJmfxD7k/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "channelTitle": "MathHelp.com", "tags": ["math", "ray", "geometry", "line", "segment", "rays"], "categoryId": "27", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "localized": {"title": "Rays - MathHelp.com - Geometry Help", "description": "For a complete lesson on geometry rays, go to http://www.MathHelp.com - 1000+ online math lessons featuring a personal math teacher inside every lesson!
