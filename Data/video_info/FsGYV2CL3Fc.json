You will learn how to find the arc length of a sector, the angle of a sector or the radius of a circle. An arc of a circle is the curve between a pair of points on the circumference of the circle. The angle of an arc is the angle sustended by the arc with a pair of radii of the circle at the center of the circle. The portion enclosed by an arc of a circle and a pair of radii of the circle is called a sector.\n\nThe relationship between the arc length (S), the radius (r), and the angle subtended by the arc at the center (theta), is given by the formula S = r(theta), when theta is in radians.
