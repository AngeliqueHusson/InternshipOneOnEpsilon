In this lesson, students learn that customary units can be converted to metric units and metric units can be converted to customary units using the following conversion factors: 1 mile = 1.6 kilometers, 1 liter = 2.1 pints, 1 inch = 2.54 centimeters, and so on. Students are then asked to solve problems using these conversion factors, such as 10 kilometers = ____ miles. Students are also asked to determine which customary unit of measurement and which metric unit of measurement are used to measure a given object. For example, milk in a bottle would be measured in gallons (customary) or in liters (metric).", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0nFdIrJkd5Q/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0nFdIrJkd5Q/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0nFdIrJkd5Q/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "channelTitle": "MathHelp.com", "tags": ["metric", "customary", "units", "unit", "measurement", "measure"], "categoryId": "27", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "localized": {"title": "Units of Measurement - MathHelp.com - Pre Algebra Help", "description": "For a complete lesson on units of measurement, go to http://www.MathHelp.com - 1000+ online math lessons featuring a personal math teacher inside every lesson!
