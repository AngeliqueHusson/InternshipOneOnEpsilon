The number one is not a prime number. The definition of a prime number is a number can be divided evenly only by 1, or itself. And it must be a whole number GREATER than 1.

Most dice have their opposite sides adding up to 7, so when I drew 3 and 4 next to each other that is incorrect.\n\n4. I said that the Gödel Incompleteness Theorems implied that mathematics is made up by humans, but that is wrong, just ignore that statement. I have learned more about it now, here is a good video explaining it: https://youtu.be/O4ndIDcDSGc\n\n5. In the animation about imaginary numbers I drew the real axis as vertical and the imaginary axis as horizontal which is opposite to the conventional way it is done.\n\nThanks so much to my supporters on Patreon.
