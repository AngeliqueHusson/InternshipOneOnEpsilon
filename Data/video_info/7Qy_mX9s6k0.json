A polygon is a plane shape bounded by a finite chain of straight lines. A regular polygon is a polygon whose sides are congruent (equal). The interior angle of a polygon is the angle between two sides of the polygon. For a regular polygon, the interior angles are congruent (equal).\n\nThe sum of the interior angles of a regular polygon is given by the formula: 180(n - 2) degrees, where n is the number of sides of the polygon. Thus, given one of the interior angles of a polygon, say m, to find the number of sides of the polygon, we solve for n in the equation: 180(n - 2) = mn, where m is the given interior angle measure.\n#geometry #polygons", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7Qy_mX9s6k0/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7Qy_mX9s6k0/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7Qy_mX9s6k0/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7Qy_mX9s6k0/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7Qy_mX9s6k0/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "channelTitle": "Brian McLogan", "tags": ["how to determine", "how to find", "how to", "determine", "sum", "measure", "angle", "interior angle", "exterior angle", "interior", "polygon", "formula", "math help", "help me with math", "given one interior angle find the number of sides", "how to find the number of sides of a polygon when given one interior angle", "how to find the number of sides when given one interior angle", "math tutorial", "how to determine number of sides of polygon", "tricks in finding sides", "using interior angle formula to find", "free math videos"], "categoryId": "27", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "defaultLanguage": "en", "localized": {"title": "How to determine the number of sides of a regular polygon, given one interior angle", "description": "Learn how to determine the number of sides of a regular polygon.
