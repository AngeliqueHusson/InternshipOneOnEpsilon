As young educators, we know that all students learn math differently and that a one-size-fits-all approach is simply ineffective. The idea that the ability to understand mathematics is reserved for a select few did not sit well with us.\n\nIn addition to sharing free teacher resources (which are teacher created resources) in the form of teacher worksheets, we share new YouTube math videos every week that help math teachers and students to better understand mathematics and the common core. Our lessons can be aligned with the common core standards for common core math  and are immensely popular with flipped learning educators and anyone experimenting with flipped classroom learning.\n\nAs educators, we know what it takes to be a super math teacher and that we can’t always do it alone. In addition to our cool math videos, we share articles, blogs, inspirational quotes, teacher math worksheets, and math worksheets. Whether you teach in the flipped classroom, operate in blended education or online blended learning, or are interested in finding cool math online, MashUp Math will have something for you!\n\nMany students think of us as a math tutor online or as their on-demand online tutor. Others trust us for all things related to online math education—coming to use when they find themselves thinking “I don’t understand my homework assignment! and need some homework help!\n\nIt is also a part of our mission to make progressive steps in mathematics education. For one, our content is created with the goal of moving students from a fixed mindset to a growth mindset. We also aim to meet the unique needs of ESL math students and support math for girls as well. \n\nMany of our users serve as a special education teacher and use our cool videos to support their special education students with special needs. Our free online math lessons are also high adaptable to your homeschool curriculum and should be added to your list of free homeschool resources.\n\nWe are also very involved in the edtech world and are very popular with Google Classroom educators, Math Games Classroom Educators, and teachers who support the use of iPad for education!\n\nSo if you could use some help with everyday math and are a student with a unique learning style or learning styles—like Visual Auditory Learning!
