When I first heard of an infinite sum(two or three years ago), I was really amazed that some of them would equal to a finite number. It seemed very strange that even if I keep adding numbers forever I would get a finite answer.  At school I was just taught to plug the numbers into the formula, without fully understanding why or how it works. \n\nIn this video I go over some examples of geometric series and how we can get some insight on why it works by using visuals. \n\nThanks for watching~\n\nP.S.\nI will be moving to China for 5 months tomorrow, so I'm not sure if I will have an access to YouTube there, due to many sites being blocked by the government. \n\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nSupport my animations on:\n\nhttps://www.patreon.com/Think_twice\n\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n\nAny further questions or ideas:\n\nEmail - thinktwiceask@gmail.com\n\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/thinktwice2580\n\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n\nPrograms used:\n\n- Cinema 4D  \n\n- Adobe Premiere Pro\n\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nMUSIC: \n\nA time of wonder\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27w-GP6ZGF0", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-y1Ob0K63hc/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-y1Ob0K63hc/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-y1Ob0K63hc/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-y1Ob0K63hc/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-y1Ob0K63hc/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "channelTitle": "Think Twice", "tags": ["infinite sums", "converge", "diverge", "infinity", "geometric series", "explained", "simple", "math", "maths", "mathematics", "sum", "powers", "think twice", "geometric", "infinite geometric series", "algebra", "arithmetic series", "sequence", "sequences and series", "geometric sequence", "infinite", "finite", "tutorial", "educational", "examples", "calculus", "divergence", "visualization", "visual mathematics", "what is infinity", "proof", "-1/12", "numberphile", "pi", "limits", "sigma", "animation", "science", "mathematics (field of study)", "education", "numbers", "addition", "logic"], "categoryId": "27", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "localized": {"title": "Infinite Sums | Geometric Series | Explained Visually", "description": "Geometric series are probably one of the first infinite sums that most of us encountered in high-school.
