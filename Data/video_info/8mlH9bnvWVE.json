It states that adding capacity could actually slow down the speed of the network. Applied to highways, the Braess Paradox means the existence of some roads slows down traffic, or that closing some roads could speed up traffic. The Braess Paradox can also explain the \"Ewing Paradox\" in the NBA and sports--that a star player may hurt a team's offence. There are also applications in physics and how far a pair of strings stretch under gravity. The Braess Paradox is a result that individual drivers are seeking the fastest roads, and when all drivers make the same choices the roads are congested (this is an example of a Nash equilibrium from game theory). The inefficiency is a result of a lack of coordination, so this is known as the \"price of anarchy.\"\n\nReferences from the video\n\n42st street closed traffic improved\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/1990/12/25/health/what-if-they-closed-42d-street-and-nobody-noticed.html\n\nNYC Map Data: Google Maps (Bluesky, DigitalGlobe, Landsat, Sanborn, USDA Farm Service Agency)\n\nBoston Map Data: Google Maps (Google, Sanborn)\n\nLondon Map Data: Google Maps (Bluesky, DigitalGlobe, Getmapping plc, Infoterra Ltd & Bluesky, The GeoInformation Group)\n\nClosing roads in New York City, Boston, and London\nhttp://arxiv.org/pdf/0712.1598v4.pdf \n\"The Price of Anarchy in Transportation Networks.\" Hyejin Youn, Michael T.
