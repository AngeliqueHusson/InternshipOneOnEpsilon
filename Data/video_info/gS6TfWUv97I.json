You've come to the right spot! It's the first \"official\" math topic and chalked full of fun exercises and great videos which help you start your journey towards math mastery. We'll cover the big ones: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, of course. But we don't stop there. We'll get into negative numbers, absolute value, decimals, and fractions, too. Learning math should be fun, and we plan on having some with you. Ready to get started?\n\nAbout Khan Academy: Khan Academy offers practice exercises, instructional videos, and a personalized learning dashboard that empower learners to study at their own pace in and outside of the classroom. We tackle math, science, computer programming, history, art history, economics, and more. Our math missions guide learners from kindergarten to calculus using state-of-the-art, adaptive technology that identifies strengths and learning gaps. We've also partnered with institutions like NASA, The Museum of Modern Art, The California Academy of Sciences, and MIT to offer specialized content.\n\nFor free. For everyone.
