In this lesson, students learn the definition of a regular polygon, as well as the following formulas related to regular polygons. The measure of each interior angle of a regular polygon is always 180(n -- 2)/n degrees, where n represents the number of sides of the polygon. The measure of each exterior angle of a regular polygon is 360/n degrees. Students are then asked to solve problems using these formulas.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/j5jkWFy323U/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/j5jkWFy323U/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/j5jkWFy323U/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "channelTitle": "MathHelp.com", "tags": ["measure", "interior", "angle", "polygon", "each", "regular", "polygons"], "categoryId": "27", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "localized": {"title": "Each Interior Angle of a Regular Polygon - MathHelp.com", "description": "For a complete lesson on regular polygons, go to http://www.MathHelp.com - 1000+ online math lessons featuring a personal math teacher inside every lesson!
