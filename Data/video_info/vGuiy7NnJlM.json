By the end of this lesson, you will be able to identify each theorem and understand which scenarios they can be applied in. Oh yeah, and you'll learn to avoid the donkey theorem :)\nFor more MashUp Math content, visit http://www.mashupmath.com and join our free mailing list! :)\n\nThis lesson answers the questions: How do I prove that two triangles are congruent? What are the triangle congruence theorems? What is SSS? What is SAS? What is ASA? What is AAS? What is HL? How do I prove triangles using hypotenuse leg?\n\nOur lessons are perfect for flipped classroom math teachers and students. This lesson is aligned with the common core learning standards for math and the SAT math curriculum as well.\n\nBe sure to join our mailing list at http://www.mashupmath.com", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vGuiy7NnJlM/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vGuiy7NnJlM/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vGuiy7NnJlM/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vGuiy7NnJlM/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vGuiy7NnJlM/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "channelTitle": "MashUp Math", "tags": ["math", "geometry", "algebra", "lesson", "common core", "free", "homeschool", "teacher", "student", "proofs", "congruence theorems", "ssa", "ass", "sas", "aas", "hl", "sss", "hypotenuse leg", "right triangle", "isosceles", "t chart", "theorem", "triangle", "triangles", "are congruent", "which", "maths", "help", "confused", "explain", "side", "angle", "why is", "khan", "yt:quality=high", "activity", "example", "practice", "exit ticket"], "categoryId": "27", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "localized": {"title": "☆WHAT ARE THE TRIANGLE CONGRUENCE THEOREMS?", "description": "Join us as we explore the five triangle congruence theorems (SSS, SAS, ASA, AAS, and HL).
