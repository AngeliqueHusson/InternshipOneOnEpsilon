In this lesson, students learn the definitions of a trapezoid, an isosceles trapezoid, and the median of a trapezoid. Students also learn the following theorems related to trapezoids. The base angles of an isosceles trapezoid are congruent. The median of a trapezoid is (a) parallel to the bases and (b) has a length equal to the average of the lengths of the bases. Students are then asked to solve problems related to these concepts using Algebra.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/d8DAYzbmuBE/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/d8DAYzbmuBE/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/d8DAYzbmuBE/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "channelTitle": "MathHelp.com", "tags": ["trapezoid", "trapezoids", "definition", "define", "quadrilateral", "quadrilaterals"], "categoryId": "27", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "localized": {"title": "Definition of a Trapezoid - MathHelp.com - Geometry Help", "description": "For a complete lesson on trapezoids, go to http://www.MathHelp.com - 1000+ online math lessons featuring a personal math teacher inside every lesson!
