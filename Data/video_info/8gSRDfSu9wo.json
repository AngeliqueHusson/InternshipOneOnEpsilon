Visit http://www.MathHelp.com.\n\nThis lesson covers the intercept method. Students learn to graph a given linear equation using the intercept method. The x-intercept is the point on the graph where the line crosses the x-axis, so the x-intercept will always have a y-coordinate of 0, and the y-intercept is the point on the graph where the line crosses the y-axis, so the y-intercept will always have an x-coordinate of 0. So to graph x + 2y = 6 using the intercept method, substitute a 0 in for y to find the x-intercept, to get x + 2(0) = 6, or x = 6. So the x-intercept is (6, 0). And substitute a 0 in for x to find the y-intercept, to get (0) + 2x = 6, or x = 3. So the y-intercept is (0, 3). Next, plot the intercepts, (6, 0) and (0, 3), and connect these points with a line.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8gSRDfSu9wo/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8gSRDfSu9wo/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8gSRDfSu9wo/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "channelTitle": "MathHelp.com", "tags": ["graphing", "graph", "lines", "using", "the", "intercept", "method", "linear", "equation", "equations", "how", "to", "do", "you"], "categoryId": "27", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "localized": {"title": "The Intercept Method | MathHelp.com", "description": "Need a custom math course?
