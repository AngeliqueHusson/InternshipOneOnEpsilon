How about area and perimeter activities for middle school students? This exploratory, hands-on cheez it lesson may be what you're looking for.\n\nGrade 3 Measurement and Data: Solve real world and mathematical problems involving perimeters of polygons, including finding the perimeter given the side lengths, finding an unknown side length, and exhibiting rectangles with the same perimeter and different areas or with the same area and different perimeters.\n\nGrade 4 Measurement and Data: Apply the area and perimeter formulas for rectangles in real world and mathematical problems. For example, find the width of a rectangular room given the area of the flooring and the length, by viewing the area formula as a multiplication equation with an unknown factor.\n\nBe sure to join our mailing list at http://www.mashupmath.com\n\nSubscribe to Our Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtBt...\n\nMashUp Math is a great free resource for math students, parents, and teachers.
