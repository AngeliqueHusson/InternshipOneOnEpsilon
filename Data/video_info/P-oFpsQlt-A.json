In this lesson, students learn that two events are independent if the outcome of the first event does not affect the outcome of the second event. For example, flipping a coin twice. And the probability of independent events can be found by multiplying the probability of the first event times the probability of the second event. For example, when flipping a coin twice, the probability of getting heads then tails is 1/2 times 1/2, which equals 1/4.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/P-oFpsQlt-A/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/P-oFpsQlt-A/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/P-oFpsQlt-A/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "channelTitle": "MathHelp.com", "tags": ["probability", "independent", "event", "events", "pre", "algebra"], "categoryId": "27", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "localized": {"title": "Probability of Independent Events - MathHelp.com - Math Help", "description": "For a complete lesson on probability of independent events, go to http://www.MathHelp.com - 1000+ online math lessons featuring a personal math teacher inside every lesson!
