In this lesson, students learn to write percents as fractions and fractions as percents. For example, to write 6% as a fraction, remember that percent means \"out of 100\", so 6% can be written as the fraction 6/100, which reduces to 3/50. So 6% can be written as the fraction 3/50. To write 7/10 as a percent, set up the proportion 7/10 = x/100, then use cross products to get (7)(100) = (10)(x), or 700 = 10x, and dividing both sides by 10, 70 = x. So 7/10 can be written as 70%.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mrsF0IZ17VI/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mrsF0IZ17VI/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mrsF0IZ17VI/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "channelTitle": "MathHelp.com", "tags": ["convert", "converting", "change", "percents", "into", "fractions", "changing", "writing", "pre", "algebra", "percentages", "percentage"], "categoryId": "27", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "localized": {"title": "Fraction to Percent - MathHelp.com - Math Help", "description": "For a complete lesson on converting fractions to percents, go to https://www.MathHelp.com - 1000+ online math lessons featuring a personal math teacher inside every lesson!
