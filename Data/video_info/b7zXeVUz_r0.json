In this lesson, students learn to graph quadratic equations that are written in y -- k = a(x -- h)2 form by using the coordinates (h, k) to graph the vertex, and using the x and y-intercepts to graph the parabola. Students are reminded that to find the y-intercept, they must substitute a 0 in for x, and to find the x-intercept(s), they must substitute a zero in for y. Students are also asked to find the axis of symmetry using the formula x = h.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/b7zXeVUz_r0/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/b7zXeVUz_r0/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/b7zXeVUz_r0/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "channelTitle": "MathHelp.com", "tags": ["Graphing", "Parabolas", "Graph", "Parabola", "parabola", "formula", "math", "help", "algebra", "two"], "categoryId": "27", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "localized": {"title": "Parabola Equations - Graphing Parabolas - MathHelp.com", "description": "For a complete lesson on parabola equations and graphing parabolas, go to http://www.MathHelp.com - 1000+ online math lessons featuring a personal math teacher inside every lesson!
