Visit http://www.MathHelp.com.\n\nThis lesson covers the circumference of a circle. Students learn that the circumference of a circle is the distance around the circle, and the formula for the circumference of a circle is 2 times pi times the radius of the circle. Pi is the ratio of the circumference to the radius, which is approximately 22/7 or 3.14. So a circle with a radius of 3 feet has a circumference of 2 times pi times 3, or 6 pi feet. And since pi = 3.14, 6 pi feet can also be written as 6 times 3.14, or 18.84 feet. Finally, note that the radius of a given circle is half the diameter of the circle. So to find the circumference of a circle with a given diameter, first find the radius of the circle by dividing the diameter by 2.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/39OHW0nYfN0/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/39OHW0nYfN0/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/39OHW0nYfN0/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/39OHW0nYfN0/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/39OHW0nYfN0/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "channelTitle": "MathHelp.com", "tags": ["circle", "formula", "diameter", "how", "find", "finding", "calculate", "convert", "calculation", "calculating", "measuring", "measure", "pi", "radius", "geometry", "circumference", "of", "for"], "categoryId": "27", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "localized": {"title": "Circumference of a Circle | MathHelp.com", "description": "Need a custom math course?
