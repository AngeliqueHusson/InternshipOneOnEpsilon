Students learn that an isosceles triangle is composed of a base, two congruent legs, two congruent base angles, and a vertex angle. Students also learn the isosceles triangle theorem, which states that if two sides of a triangle are congruent, then the angles opposite those sides are congruent; and the converse of the isosceles triangle theorem, which states that if two angles of a triangle are congruent, then the sides opposite those angles are congruent. Students are then asked to solve problems related to these theorems using Algebra.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zV7aDRMEt9U/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zV7aDRMEt9U/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zV7aDRMEt9U/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "channelTitle": "MathHelp.com", "tags": ["isosceles", "triangle", "theorem", "the", "theorems", "formula", "base", "angle", "angles", "are", "congruent", "geometry", "of", "properties"], "categoryId": "27", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "localized": {"title": "The Isosceles Triangle Theorem | MathHelp.com", "description": "Need a custom math course?
