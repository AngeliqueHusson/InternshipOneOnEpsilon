The goal will be to isolate the radical by itself on one side of the equals sign, and then square both sides of the equation in order to eliminate the square root. Then we'll be able to solve for the variable using inverse operations.\n\n● ● ● GET EXTRA HELP ● ● ●\n\nIf you could use some extra help with your math class, then check out Krista’s website // http://www.kristakingmath.com\n\n● ● ● CONNECT WITH KRISTA ● ● ●\n\nHi, I’m Krista! I make math courses to keep you from banging your head against the wall. ;)\n\nMath class was always so frustrating for me. I’d go to a class, spend hours on homework, and three days later have an “Ah-ha!” moment about how the problems worked that could have slashed my homework time in half. I’d think, “WHY didn’t my teacher just tell me this in the first place?!”\n\nSo I started tutoring to keep other people out of the same aggravating, time-sucking cycle. Since then, I’ve recorded tons of videos and written out cheat-sheet style notes and formula sheets to help every math student—from basic middle school classes to advanced college calculus—figure out what’s going on, understand the important concepts, and pass their classes, once and for all.
