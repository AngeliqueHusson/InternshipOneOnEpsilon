And with good reason. dx doesn't start to feel relevant until later on, when you start working with multivariable functions, multiple integrals, and differential equations.\n\nBut that's no reason not to at least address dx in an introductory way. In this video, we'll talk about a few of the simplest explanations for what dx does, what it tells us to do, and what it represents.\n\nWhen you're just starting out with integrals, for the most part, it's okay to think about dx as just notation. It just comes with the integral symbol, and you don't need to know exactly why it's there in order to know that you're supposed to integrate.\n\nOnce you start changing variables, it's important to know that the dx always tells you which variable to integrate. That's why you'll see dx with a function in terms of x, dt with a function in terms of t, and dy with a function in terms of y. You'll also need to understand that your limits of integration (if you're dealing with a definite integral), will need to match the variable in your function and the variable in your dx/dt/dy/etc.\n\nWhen you get to multivariable calculus and multiple integrals, you'll need to realize that seeing dx dy at the end of the integral tells you to integrate first with respect to x, and then with respect to y.\n\nBut most importantly, you'll want to understand that dx represents the differential, or the difference between two values of x. It's the distance between two values of x. So, when you use a Riemann sum, or trapezoidal rule to approximate the area under a curve, delta x is the width of each rectangle (or trapezoid).\n\nWhen you switch from these approximation methods, and start using the integral instead to find exact area, that delta x has to change to dx in order to match the integral. Essentially what you're doing is saying that delta x represents a larger width, which is why you can only get an approximation. But dx represents and infinitely small distance, which is why it gets paired with the integral, and allows you to find exact area, instead of just an approximation.\n\nAnd that's why you always need a dx whenever you're using an integral.\n\n● ● ● GET EXTRA HELP ● ● ●\n\nIf you could use some extra help with your math class, then check out Krista’s website // http://www.kristakingmath.com\n\n● ● ● CONNECT WITH KRISTA ● ● ●\n\nHi, I’m Krista! I make math courses to keep you from banging your head against the wall. ;)\n\nMath class was always so frustrating for me. I’d go to a class, spend hours on homework, and three days later have an “Ah-ha!” moment about how the problems worked that could have slashed my homework time in half. I’d think, “WHY didn’t my teacher just tell me this in the first place?!”\n\nSo I started tutoring to keep other people out of the same aggravating, time-sucking cycle. Since then, I’ve recorded tons of videos and written out cheat-sheet style notes and formula sheets to help every math student—from basic middle school classes to advanced college calculus—figure out what’s going on, understand the important concepts, and pass their classes, once and for all.
