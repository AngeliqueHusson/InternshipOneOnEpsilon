As young educators, we know that all students learn math differently and that a one-size-fits-all approach is simply ineffective. The idea that the ability to understand mathematics is reserved for a select few did not sit well with us.\n\nIn addition to sharing free teacher resources (which are teacher created resources) in the form of teacher worksheets, we share new YouTube math videos every week that help math teachers and students to better understand mathematics and the common core. Our lessons can be aligned with the common core standards for common core math  and are immensely popular with flipped learning educators and anyone experimenting with flipped classroom learning.\n\nAs educators, we know what it takes to be a super math teacher and that we can’t always do it alone. In addition to our cool math videos, we share articles, blogs, inspirational quotes, teacher math worksheets, and math worksheets. Whether you teach in the flipped classroom, operate in blended education or online blended learning, or are interested in finding cool math online, MashUp Math will have something for you!\n\nMany students think of us as a math tutor online or as their on-demand online tutor. Others trust us for all things related to online math education—coming to use when they find themselves thinking “I don’t understand my homework assignment! and need some homework help!\n\nIt is also a part of our mission to make progressive steps in mathematics education. For one, our content is created with the goal of moving students from a fixed mindset to a growth mindset. We also aim to meet the unique needs of ESL math students and support math for girls as well. \n\nMany of our users serve as a special education teacher and use our cool videos to support their special education students with special needs. Our free online math lessons are also high adaptable to your homeschool curriculum and should be added to your list of free homeschool resources.\n\nWe are also very involved in the edtech world and are very popular with Google Classroom educators, Math Games Classroom Educators, and teachers who support the use of iPad for education!\n\nSo if you could use some help with everyday math and are a student with a unique learning style or learning styles—like Visual Auditory Learning! Or if you’re tired of math games and are more interested in an easy-to-follow tutorial, check us out and learn math with us. No matter your school’s standards of learning, our YouTube Math Videos Lessons will work for you!\n\nAnd if you love STEM and Math Education as much as we do, be sure to visit us at this year’s ISTE 2016 EdTech Conference in Denver, CO on June 26-29th!\n\nIt's time to leave those boring lectures and monotone voices behind and enter the new school of learning math :)\n\n-Anthony Persico & The MashUp Math Team", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UoLgHZAy6YE/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UoLgHZAy6YE/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UoLgHZAy6YE/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UoLgHZAy6YE/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "channelTitle": "MashUp Math", "tags": ["yt:quality=high", "math", "maths", "cool math videos", "lesson", "super math teacher", "flipped", "teacher worksheets", "learning", "common core math", "classroom", "education", "geometry", "algebra", "8th grade", "volume", "of a cone", "cone", "cubic inch", "formula", "edtech", "practice", "help", "teacher", "acitivty", "video", "prism", "surface area", "how do I", "where can I find", "march madness", "dimension", "volume of", "cone area", "grade 8", "hot math teacher"], "categoryId": "17", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "localized": {"title": "✪ How Do I Find Volume of a Cone? | 8th Grade Geometry", "description": "After this lesson, check out our newest video upload: \"✪ Comparing Equivalent Fractions | 4th Grade Fractions\" \n&rarr; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nwsx-CsDLsc\n-~-~~-~~~-~~-~-\n\nJoin us on this flipped math lesson for the 8th grade math standards  where we work through a problem that was inspired by a released exam item where we practice finding the volume of a cone.\n\n\nThis lesson answers the question: What is volume?
