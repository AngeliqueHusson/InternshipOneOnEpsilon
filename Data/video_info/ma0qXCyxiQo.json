In this lesson, students learn the following theorems related to arcs and chords. In the same circle or congruent circles, if two arcs are congruent, then their chords are congruent. If a diameter is perpendicular to a chord, then it bisects the chord and its arc. In the same circle or congruent circles, if two chords are the same distance from the center of a circle, then the chords are congruent. Students are then asked to solve problems related to these theorems using Algebra.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ma0qXCyxiQo/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ma0qXCyxiQo/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ma0qXCyxiQo/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "channelTitle": "MathHelp.com", "tags": ["chord", "chords", "circle", "circles", "length", "of"], "categoryId": "27", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "localized": {"title": "Arcs and Chords - MathHelp.com - Geometry Help", "description": "For a complete lesson on arcs and chords, go to http://www.MathHelp.com - 1000+ online math lessons featuring a personal math teacher inside every lesson!
