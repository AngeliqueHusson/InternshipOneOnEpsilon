For more MashUp Math content, visit http://www.mashupmath.com and join our free mailing list! :)\n\nThis lesson answers the questions: What is an isosceles triangle? What is the base angle theorem? What is the relationship between the sides and angles of an isosceles triangle? How can I prove that a triangle is isosceles?\n\nOur lessons are perfect for flipped classroom math teachers and students. This lesson is aligned with the common core learning standards for math and the SAT math curriculum as well.\n\nBe sure to join our mailing list at http://www.mashupmath.com", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AzJs36FqkGU/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AzJs36FqkGU/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AzJs36FqkGU/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AzJs36FqkGU/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AzJs36FqkGU/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "channelTitle": "MashUp Math", "tags": ["math", "geometry", "algebra", "lesson", "common core", "free", "homeschool", "teacher", "student", "triangle", "base angle theorem", "relationship", "opposite sides", "opposite angles", "base angles", "isosceles", "triangles", "congruent", "similar", "prove", "proof", "flipped", "blended", "learning", "classroom", "khan", "theorem", "angle", "angles", "side", "sides", "equilateral", "yt:quality=high", "practice", "activity", "example", "exit ticket"], "categoryId": "27", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "localized": {"title": "☆ What is an Isosceles Triangle?
