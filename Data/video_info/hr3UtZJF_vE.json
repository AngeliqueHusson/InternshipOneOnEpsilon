How can we use a visual fraction model to show a quotient? How can we multiply and divide fractions?\n\nOur lessons are perfect for flipped classroom math teachers and students and for warm-up and exit ticket activities . This lesson is aligned with the 5th grade common core math learning standards for math and the SAT math curriculum as well.\n\nBe sure to join our mailing list at http://www.mashupmath.com", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hr3UtZJF_vE/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hr3UtZJF_vE/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hr3UtZJF_vE/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hr3UtZJF_vE/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hr3UtZJF_vE/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "channelTitle": "MashUp Math", "tags": ["yt:quality=high", "math", "maths", "algebra", "geometry", "common core", "learning standards", "flipped", "learning", "lesson", "classroom", "unit fraction", "5th grade", "interpret", "division", "multiplication", "visual fraction model", "idea", "practice", "exercise", "problem", "how do I", "teach", "fractions", "quotient", "khan", "Common Core State Standards Initiative"], "categoryId": "27", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "localized": {"title": "✪ Interpret Division as a Unit Fraction | 5th Grade Common Core Math", "description": "Join us on this flipped math lesson for CCLS 5.NF.B.7.A where we work through a problem that was inspired by a released common core exam item where we multiply and divide fractions and interpret them as unit rates.\n\nThis lesson answers the question: How can students interpret division as a unit rate?
