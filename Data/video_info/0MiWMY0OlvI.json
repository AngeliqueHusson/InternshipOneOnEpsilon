In this lesson, we take a procedural look at graphing cube roots and examine the common mistakes that students make. For more MashUp Math content, visit http://www.mashupmath.com and join our free mailing list! :)\n\nThis lesson answers the questions: What is a cube root function? What is a cubic function? How do I graph a function? How do I graph a function without a calculator? \n\nOur lessons are perfect for flipped classroom math teachers and students. This lesson is aligned with the common core learning standards for math and the SAT math curriculum as well.\n\nBe sure to join our mailing list at http://www.mashupmath.com", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0MiWMY0OlvI/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0MiWMY0OlvI/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0MiWMY0OlvI/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0MiWMY0OlvI/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0MiWMY0OlvI/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "channelTitle": "MashUp Math", "tags": ["math", "geometry", "algebra", "lesson", "common core", "free", "homeschool", "teacher", "student", "algebra 2", "cube root function", "mistake", "domain", "restricted domain", "flipped", "flip", "class", "learning", "classroom", "plans", "idea", "ideas", "visual learner", "differentiation", "cube root", "example", "practice", "graphing", "activity", "cubic root function", "cube root of"], "categoryId": "27", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "localized": {"title": "Cubic Function Graphs and Cube Roots Explained", "description": "Learn how to graph cubic function graphs and how to graph cube roots,\n\nJoin us as we explore an example of graphing a cube root function over a restricted domain.
