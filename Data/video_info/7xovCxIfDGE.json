Students also learn the following formulas related to convex polygons. The sum of the measures of the interior angles of a polygon is always 180(n -- 2) degrees, where n represents the number of sides of the polygon. The sum of the measures of the exterior angles of a polygon is always 360 degrees. Students are then asked to solve problems using these formulas.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7xovCxIfDGE/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7xovCxIfDGE/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7xovCxIfDGE/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "channelTitle": "MathHelp.com", "tags": ["sum", "of", "interior", "angles", "polygon", "polygons", "what", "is", "180(n-2)", "formula", "measures", "measure", "math", "geometry", "help", "for", "the", "angle"], "categoryId": "27", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "localized": {"title": "Sum of Interior Angles of a Polygon | MathHelp.com", "description": "Need a custom math course?
