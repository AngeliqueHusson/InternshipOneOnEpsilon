In this lesson, students learn that when solving an absolute value equation, such as 2 + I x + 1 I = 8, the first step is to isolate the absolute value by subtracting 2 from both sides to get I x + 1 I = 6.  The next step is to split the equation up into two separate equations in the following way: x + 1 = 6 or x + 1 = -6.  Notice that in the second equation, the 6 becomes negative.  Finally, the last step is to solve each of the remaining equations to get x = 5 or x = -7.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NxbLXwXXp7Y/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NxbLXwXXp7Y/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NxbLXwXXp7Y/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "channelTitle": "MathHelp.com", "tags": ["absolute", "value", "equations", "equation", "solving", "solve", "math"], "categoryId": "27", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "localized": {"title": "Absolute Value Equations - MathHelp.com - Algebra Help", "description": "For a complete lesson on solving absolute value equations, go to http://www.MathHelp.com - 1000+ online math lessons featuring a personal math teacher inside every lesson!
