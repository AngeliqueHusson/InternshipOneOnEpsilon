In his last days in the Oval Office,  he walks us through inverse trigonometric functions, in this stunning intro to the topic. We cover what inverse sin of ratios means, compared to just sin of angles. (Sometimes inverse sin is called arcsin.) We work with radians and degrees, in all four quadrants.
