hello my name is Maria Miller from mathmama : this is mathie my mascot and assistantin this lesson we are gon na study inchesfeet yards and miles and I intend thislesson for about fourth grade sochildren already know some things aboutinches and feet for example and just asa review 12 inches makes one foot thatis very important to remember and thenthree feet makes one yard and studentsof course need to get familiar with somehands-on activities with theseparticular conversion factors so thatthey are allowed to measure objectsusing a measuring tape and I 'll show youone over here and this usual this onemarks the one foot mark the 12 inchesmakes one foot and this one f above the12 and then I can scroll that further at24 inches those two F or two feet and soon over there 36 inches three feet andso so using this kind of measuring saidstudents should go and measure differentthings just to get familiar withmeasuring and then we 'll go on to thistask of converting between inches andfeet and also yards and feet and thiswill use multiplication tables a lotstudents need to remember themultiplication table of 12 here becausethe factory is 12 then over here tableof 3 ok for example 2 feet 3 inchesequals how many inches now 1 foot is 12so 2 feet is 24 inches right and add 3to that so we get 27 inches and 5 feet 6inches again we multiply by 12 5 times12 it 's 60 inches plus 6 more 66 inchesso there if you can if you 're changingfrom feet and inches to increase thenyou multiply by 12 this here the amountof feet then vice versa the other wayaround we have so manyand we convert those to so many feet andinches we need to divide by 12 becauseeach 12 inches makes a foot we need tofigure out how many 12s are in thisnumber how many 12s are in this of thisnumber dividing by 12 so how manytwelves are in this one this one 12inches there makes a foot and then threeinches left over right and how many 12sign here in the 24 would make two times12 so there 's two feet two times 12 is24 and three inches again left over Oh58 how many trolls are in it now fivetimes 12 would be sixty it 's close so 4times 12 4 times 12 is 48 inches and so10 inches left over 4 feet and 10 inchesand this will take some practice ok nowwith yards and feet a conversion factoris 3 feet to one yard one yard is 3 feet3 yards 3 times 3 or nightly and herefive yard is 2 feet okay 1 yard is 3bits of 5 yards5 times 3 15 feet plus 2 17 feet and theother way around from feet to yards andfeet we will need to divide by 3 becausewe need to figure out how many threesare in each of these numbers how manythrees are here ok thus 1 times 3 makesthe yard and one foot left over and howmany 3 is here well almost for almost 4times 3 but just three times 309 whichleaves two feet left over and threeyards and how many threes are here sevenexactly 7 yards makes 21 feet and thenhere 35 divided by 3 it 's almost 12 it's11 11 times 3 so 11 yards and then twofeet left or its division withremainders essentiallylet 's go on here we have some problemsthat tie in with geometry find theperimeter and this is trying to be asquare this is trying to be a regularhexagon okay so in a square all foursides are the same if one side is 2 feet7 inches we can multiply that times 4right to get the perimeter the perimetermeans that go around measure you goaround the figure once and how long wasthe distance I will multiply this times4 ok 4 times 2 feet 7 inches I canmultiply the feet and inches separatelyat first 4 times 2 feet would be 8 feetand then 4 times 7 inches is 28 inchesand now I just have to figure out thatall these entries how many whole feetwill they make 12 inches makes 1 foot 24next 2 feetso get 2 more feet from them so I addthem here to the 8 feet I get 10 feetand then 24 inches 28 inches that 's 4inches left or so that 's the perimeterover here we have a similar situationit 's a regular hexagon so each side isthe same so we multiply this metal hereby 6 6 times 3 yards and 2 feet againI 'll just multiply separately 6 times 3gives me 18 yards put this inparentheses I guess and then 6 times 2feet is 12 feet and now I have to thinkof those all those feet do they make anywhole yards sure enough you know becauseeach 3 feet makes 1 yard and have 12feet so I get 4 more yards from therenone left over so exactly 22 yards allright now what is it messymath is telling you not to pause thevideo and and try to solve this problemon your own before we go on and solve ithere on the board so just try it on yourown first the question is the perimeterof this rectangle is 21 feet one sidehere is given and we asked what is thelonger side how long is the longer sideokay let 's solve this problem now andthere 's at least two different ways tosolve it and when it comes to perimeterof rectangles I like to think in half ofthe perimeter because perimeter is yougo all the way around so half of theperimeter is this and this side togetherthis of this side is half of theperimeter so let me write here that halfof the perimeter half P means half ofthe perimeter it is half of this number21 feet what 's half of it well it 's tenfeet ten and a half feet actually buthalf the fourth is six inchesten feet six inches okay so this Plusthis is ten feet six inches now it ispretty easy to solve is n't it three feetplus seven feet would make ten and fiveinches plus one inch one would make sixinches the other way to solve it wouldbe that you take a whole perimeter 21feet and subtract from it two times thissubtract from it three feet five inchesand three feet five inches or subtractthe 6 feet ten inches and this minus sixfeet 10 inches leaves us with 14 feet 2inches and then 14 feet 2 inches is thisPlus this so you divide that by 2 to get7 feet 1 inch okay lastly we will lookat this one mile is 5280 feet this is ofcourse a difficult number tobut often in math problems via given thenumber so it 's not so necessary toremember exactly as at least two andoriginally one my used to be exactlyfive thousand Roman feet in the time ofancient Rome they had it they had itthat 's an easy number five thousand feetbut somewhere along the way in thehistory it could changed so that itbecame 5,280 feet an odd number in thatsense now how many feet are in fivemiles that 's a simple multiplicationproblem with this multiply this numbertimes five so we get some practice withmultiplication five times 5,280 timesfive five times zero 5 times 8 is 40 5times 2 is 10 plus 4 14 and then fivetimes five plus 1 is 26 26 thousand fourhundred feet then lastly Mount McKinleyMount McKinley in Alaska is 20,320 feettallit 's a tall mountain about how manymiles is that aboutnotice this it is asking us to estimateor approximate about how many miles andwhen you 're estimating or approximatingjust use 5,000 feet for your mile it'san easy number to work with and this weround to to 20,000 feet so 20,000 feetand then 5,000 feet per mile pretty easyit 's about 4 miles tall right about 4miles not quite close Conversions between inches, feet, and yards (4th and 5th grade math) Conversions between inches, feet, and yards (4th and 5th grade math) Conversions
