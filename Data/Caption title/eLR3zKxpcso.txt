I want to show you a cool way to multiply two numbers.Start with the parabola y=x^2.Now choose two positive numbers , say 11 and 7.From the origin , go 11 units to the left and 7 units to the right.Go up from each point to the curve , then form the straight line joining thesetwo points.The place where the line crosses the y-axis is77 , the product of 11 and 7.This is no coincidence.To multiply a and b , go a units to the left and b units to the right , take each point up to the curve , draw the line connectingthem , and interesect the y-axis at the value a timesb.You can try this yourself by printing out a copy of thegraph found on the webpage given in the video description.Try different starting numbers and see that it really works ! I first heard of this some years ago when I visited the Mathematikum , a fantastic mathematics museum in Giessen , Germany.Besides having puzzles with shapes and celebratingnumbers , they exhibit a parabolic calculator.By using pegs to mark the two points on the curve , a string withweights on the ends forms the straight line.Why does the parabolic calculator work ? The slope of the line segment joining these two points simplifiesto b-a , while the slope of the segment joining these other two pointsis the same.This means that the point ( 0 , ab ) is on the line joining the outertwo points , and we 've completed the proof.This parabolic technique shows that multiplication isconnected to squaring numbers , a fact seen by thisformula.Let me leave you with this simple question : how can you use the parabola to multiply 7and -4 ? Think about it . test
