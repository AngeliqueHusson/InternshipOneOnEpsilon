hey everybody welcome another one math video video teach synthetic division important know synthetic division used first degree x denominator exponent x denominator case synthetic division used important know let get star ted example step number one written left green say place coefficient descending order notice ax cube x constant place descending order power coefficient front x cube k since coefficient front x cube going put inside box notice get skip ped x x squared term x squared x squared term going put next coefficient notice coefficient firm next highest term x negative going put negative finally last coefficient want outside place opposite number denominator notice negative denominator outside want place positive moving right along synthetic division first step synthetic division want bring first number want bring number write line next step want multiply want place want place need add second column give positive need repeat process want want multiply positive want place right sorry negative positive times give positive need add third column negative positive plus negative need repeat process one last time need multiply negative need place right positive times negative give negative add last column positive minus give us last number done synthetic division circle red remainder always going remainder final answer always start one degree less numerator since highest degree new reiter since three exponent answer going one degree less going degree two coefficient goes front x squared term first coefficient synthetic division since first coefficient one one goes x squared term next term x since next term coefficient synthetic division three coefficient three front x since next coefficient negative two next coefficient minus two finally remainder since remainder two numerator fraction always put dividing since dividing x minus three debt final answer hope video understand synthetic division little bit better need extra help live tutor ing please go web site meeting napping um also like way teach like seeing video please subscribe tube channel thank much watching video take care synthetic division polynomial synthetic division polynomial synthetic division polynomial synthetic division polynomial synthetic division polynomial synthetic division polynomial synthetic division polynomial synthetic division polynomial synthetic division polynomial synthetic division polynomial synthetic division polynomial
