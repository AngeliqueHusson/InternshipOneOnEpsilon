in this lesson you will learn about areaso here we have a figure this is asquare it 's three units by three unitsand I want to find out the area that orthe areas is how many square units arewithin that figure so if I were to splitthis up into three parts and three partsthis way okay so there are three acrosshere and three down three units whateverit is might be centimeters might beinches might be kilometers what I'mfinding is how many squares are withinthis figure and if I count them one twothree four five six seven eight ninethere are nine squares or nine squareunits within that okay we have a formulaarea equals the length times the widthso the length times the width areaequals 3 times 3 and the area equals 9units they 're square units or ninesquare unitsokay to find this one we have threeunits here so if I split this into threeunits and then it 's six across here soI 'm going to split it about and 1/2first into three units then split thatinto three units okay so I have sixunits across there three units there andif I add them up I get six 12 and 18 orthe area equals the length times thewidth which is six times three the areaequals 18 I can write it square unitsthat way if I 'd like this way or thatway is fine and that 's the end of ourlesson on area test
