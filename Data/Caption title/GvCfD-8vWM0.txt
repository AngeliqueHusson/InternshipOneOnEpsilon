okay are you ready to play with theinfinite let 's do it let 's do it an x1machine again I 'll do another polynomialdivision problem they 're going to be aparticularly simple one that 's kind ofdeceptively tricky in the end what Iwant to do is take the very simplepolynomial one so let me draw a picturewhat that looks like it 's going to beone side but let me draw the full x onemachines as XY machinegames x left as iplease and this is just one dot allright but what i want to do for this onedot is divided by one minus X all rightwhat is one most X looks like whilst canit be let 's see it could be one anti Xso one anted up there and one axle 1 1dot here goes 1 divided by 1 minus Xmeans under this pattern in this pictureof one not much to go on right nowhowever we 've learned life lessons inthe past there 's something in life youwant make it happenand deal the consequences so at 1 dotthere I 'd love to have an anti dot to gowith it so make it happen and see allthe consequences there box is stilltechnically empty but now I found one ofwhat I want brilliant hmm well look atthis dot hereI want me to go with it I want to addyou up here with it make it happendeal the consequence is another thing ofwhat we want I got a dot here as I havean anti-knock next to it steal theconsequences put a dot with it andanother thing of what I want is that Ican see now I 'm going to be doing thisfor plate the wilesin fact it 's going to go on infinitelyon ever I 'm caught in an infinite loopall right so the answer is 1 1 1 1 1going on foreverhow do I interpret that answer what'sharder start from the left so maybewe 'll actually start from the right thatis 1 1 + 1 X + 1 x squared + 1 X cubed +1 X to the fourth and one expletiveforever I 've actually got an infinitesum so we 've just proven something crazyif I do this polynomial division problemright here the answer is a sum that goeson foreverwhoa in fact this is a very famous formin mathematics but most people write itall around they start with this infinitesum and say it has this artist which isaround and in most books is called thegeometric series formula so you mightsee in a precastclass or calculus class but it comes upin mathematics and look we got to theinfinite just by playing with dots andboxes I love it and that 's only one ofmany is the sums we can play with so Iinvite you to play with more lots ofthem to go for or I have funyou Lesson 7.2 of Exploding Dots Lesson 7.2 of Exploding Dots Lesson 7.2 of Exploding Dots
