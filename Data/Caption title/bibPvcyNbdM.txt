- Hi , welcome to this question right here . So , in the following diagram which ishere , the radius of the triangle is 24 centimeters , right ? And we know the angleB , D , and C. That 's this angle right here , is 75 degrees . So , we 're trying to figureout the angle BAC , which is right over here . So , that 's the missing angle thatyou 're trying to figure out , okay ? Now , there 's a relationship between thisangle and this angle . Now , the angle 75 is called the central angle . The centralangle is called the C , for example , okay ? And the inscribed angle of that centralangle is only just half of that , okay ? So , it 's equal to the inscribed angle but youneed to put a two times right there , okay ? So , basically the central angle is double , double of the inscribed angle . Now , how doyou know that one is really an inscribed while the other is the center ? Well , thecentral angle is always from a point and then the other point , and they form withthe center line , okay ? The center point , okay ? So , this is your central angle righthere . Now , if you start and finish with the samepoints , which is B and C , and you form any triangle around your circle right here , those are called your inscribed angles , okay ? Or they have the same arc lengths.You can actually look at the arc lengths right here . This is the arc length of thetriangles , right ? So , as long as they share the same arc length . Does n't have to start from here tohere . It could be somewhere else . As long as the arc length , the A-R-C , is the same.Therefore , this equation right here will exist , okay ? The central angle is thedouble of the inscribed angle . So , if that 's 75 over here , then , basically it'sjust two times the missing angle . Which is , let me put down . . .75 degrees and there 's your two theta that 's missing , okay ? So , just grab yourcalculator and take the 75 divided by two , you get yourself the angle , which is thisone right here , the BAC will just be 37.5 degrees . And that 's your final answer forthis question . Thanks for watching .
