hi welcome question right following diagram radius triangle centimeter right know angle b c thats angle right degree trying figure angle bac right thats missing angle trying figure theres relationship angle angle angle cal led central angle central angle cal led c example inscribe angle central angle half equal inscribe angle need put two times right basically central angle double double inscribe angle know one really inscribe center well central angle always point point form center line center point central angle right start finish b c form triangle around circle right cal led inscribe angle arc actually look arc length right arc length right long share arc length doesnt start could somewhere else long arc length arc therefore equation right exist central angle double inscribe angle thats basically two times missing angle let put degree theres two theta thats missing grab calculator take divided two get angle one right bac degree thats final answer question thanks watching determine angle circle central inscribe angle relation determine angle circle central inscribe angle relation determine angle circle central inscribe angle relation determine angle circle central inscribe angle relation determine angle circle central inscribe angle relation
