hi welcome question right following diagram radius triangle centimeter right know angle b c angle right degree trying figure angle bac right missing angle trying figure relationship angle angle angle cal led central angle central angle cal led c example inscribe angle central angle half equal inscribe angle need put two times right basically central angle double double inscribe angle know one really inscribe center well central angle always point point form center line center point central angle right start finish b c form triangle around circle right cal led inscribe angle arc actually look arc length right arc length right long share arc length n start could somewhere else long arc length arc therefore equation right exist central angle double inscribe angle basically two times missing angle let put degree two theta missing grab calculator take divided two get angle one right bac degree final answer question thanks watching determine angle circle central inscribe angle relation determine angle circle central inscribe angle relation determine angle circle central inscribe angle relation determine angle circle central inscribe angle relation determine angle circle central inscribe angle relation
