in this video I 'm gon na do one moreexample of graphing a parabola so herewe 're gon na graph negative three xsquared plus X plus one one thing Inotice here is a is going to be thevalue negative threeagain that 's the coefficient on the xsquared and that to me just tells methat the parabola is going to opendownward so I already know that thevertex remember we can find the vertexeither by completing the square or byusing this formula negative B over 2aand then F of negative B over 2aso that 's what I 'm going to use in thiscase so remember B is the coefficient onthe X so we 'll get the negative 1 over 2times negative 3 so that 's just going tobe positive 1 over 6 so that 's goingit 's going to be the x-coordinate of ourvertex if we plug that back into ourformula to get the y-coordinate we'llhave negative 3 times 1 over 6 squaredplus 1 over 6 plus 1 okay so 1 over 6times 1 over 6 is 1 over 36 negative 3over 36 is going to be negative 112 solet 's see I could make this multiply topand bottom by 2 that would give me 2over 12 I can multiply top and bottom of1 by 12 over 12 I can just write 1 thatway so now negative 1 plus 12 is goingto be positive 1 excuse me negative 1plus 2 is positive 11 plus 12 is 13 so I 'm getting 13 over12 as the y-coordinate for our vertex soalready I mean I know a little bit hereso let'sto try to make it a fairly decent littlelittle parabola a little shifted let'ssee so here 's X here 's Y let 's make thispositive one and we 'll put positive oneup thereso one-sixth is n't very big at all it'sa pretty small number thirteen overtwelve that 's a little bit bigger thanone so let 's put the vertex right thereand again it 's always good to kind oflabel things so I 'll say that 's one oversix thirteen over twelve I know sincethis thing is opening downwards it'sgonna I 'm gon na have X intercepts allparabolas have y-intercepts but this isdefinitely going to hit the x-axis tofind the y-intercept remember to findthe y-intercept all we do is we justtake our formula and we plug in x equalszero so if we do that we 'll get f ofzero will just get negative three times0 which is 0 plus 0 plus 1 so it says weget the value of positive 1 out so Iknow that the graph goes through thepoint zero comma 1 and the next thingI 'm gon na do is simply find thex-intercepts so remember to findx-interceptswe have to substitute in the value yequals zero or equivalently f of xequals zero and then solve so i 'm gonnaplug 0 on the Left we 've got negative 3xsquared plus X plus 1 you can play withthis I do n't think this is gon na factorit all very nicely so I 'm just gon na usethe quadratic formula x equals negativeB so that 'll give us negative 1 plus orminus the square root of b squared minus4 times a which is negative 3 times Cwhich is positive 1 and then we take 2times our a value which is going to benegative 3 and now we 've got to cleanthis up a little bit so we 've gotnegative 1 on top plus or minus thesquare root 1 squared is 1 negative 4negative 3 is gon na be positive 12 1plus 12 is going to give us 13 in thedenominator we have negative 6 and nowwe 've got our two x-intercepts negative1 plus root 13 over negative 6 andnegative 1 minus root 13 over negative 6and I think what I 'm going to do just togive myself a kind of a better intuitionabout these numbers is I 'm gonnaapproximate them a little bit just tokind of figure out where they 're sittingyou know where they 're sitting at on thethe x-axis I used a little calculatorhere the square root of 13 is going tobe roughly equal to I got 3.6 so I'mgoing to use that and just do a littlebit of arithmetic here so let 's seenegative 1 plus 3.6 over negative 6 willbe one of our x-intercepts or anapproximation to it negative 1 minus 3.6I left my negative off up here on thisone sorry about that so they'redefinitely both divided by negative sixso negative one plus three point six istwo point six over negative six that'llbe one of them negative one minus threepoint six is negative of 4 point 6 overnegative six so let 's see two point sixdivided by negative sixthis is roughly equal to negative pointfour three repeating that 's actuallyexactly what it is and our second valueso four point six divided by six isgoing to be positive I 'm getting thesecond value to be roughly equal to twopoint seven six repeating so those aregonna be our our two x-intercepts soone 's a little smaller than one theothers in between negative one and zeroso at least now I know a little bitbetter where these points are on thex-axis so let 's see one of them was alittle bit smaller than one so let 's seea little bit smaller than one and theother one let 's stick negative one onour graph as well so the other one itwould be somewhere roughly inside ofthereso now I 'm gon na label him thoughexactly that would be the point let'ssee that was the positive one so thatwould be negative one plus the squareroot of 13 over negative six and thenthis other point is so we know whatexactly that would be negative one minusthe square root of thirteen all overnegative six and now I 've got enough tokind of place and connect the dots hereand we 'll have a nice little graph so Ithink kind of got the useful informationwe know the vertex now we know thex-intercepts exactly we found they-intercept and I think between thosefew things that 's enough to provide apretty reasonable graph of your parabola test
