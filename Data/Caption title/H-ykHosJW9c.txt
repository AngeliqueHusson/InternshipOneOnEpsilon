- [ Voiceover ] What I wan na talk about in this videois shapes with four sides , and the mathy word for shapes with four sidesis quadrilateral.Quadrilateral.And any time you see quad as part of a word , it 's a good , it 's a good signthat you 're dealing with the number four somehow.So a quadrilateral is something that has four sides.So that is a quadrilateral , this is a quadrilateral , this is a quadrilateral.They all have four sides.This is a quadrilateral.even this is a , let me make it look even weirder , even this is a quadrilateral.So what 's not a quadrilateral ? Well , a triangle would not be a quadrilateral.It has three sides , one , two , three.So let 's cross that out.A pentagon that has five sides , that would not be a quadrilateral.It has one , two , three , four , five sides.A circle that has , I guess you could say , no sides , it 's just one big curve , it 's a circle.That 's not going to be a quadrilateral.If you had six sides , seven sides , a hundred sides , none of that is going to be a quadrilateral.So now let 's think aboutthe different types of quadrilaterals , or the different categories of quadrilaterals.So one is the parallelogram.So a parallelogram is a quadrilateral , and as we learn more math , we 'll learn other ways of thinking about this.It 's a quadrilateral where opposite sides are parallel.And parallel is just another way of sayingthat they 're going in the same direction.So what do I mean by that ? So something like this , something like this , would be a parallelogram.Why ? Because this side is opposite to this side , and they 're pointed in the same direction.They 're going , they 're going , if I were to draw an arrow , if I were to draw an arrow here , those arrows are pointed in the same way.So those two sides are pointed , are parallel , is the word we say.And these two sides , these two sides right over here are parallel.So this is a parallelogram.So what are other examples of parallelogram ? Well even your classic square , even your classic square , is a parallelogram.And we 'll talk more about what makes a square special.It 's a special type of parallelogrambecause this sideis going in the same direction as that side , and this side , and this side , whoops , let me do that in yellow , and this side is parallel to that side.So what 's not a parallelogram ? Well , something like , something like thiswould not be a parallelogram.You might say , `` Wait , '' I see two opposite sides are parallel . `` You might say , `` Look , this is parallel to this . `` But then you would see that this is not parallel to this.One way to think about some things that are not parallelis if the lines kept going , they would cross each other at some point , while these lines , these lines right over here , they 're never going to cross each other.So this one right over hereis not a parallelogram.It has one set of opposite sides being parallel , but not the other.Another example of something that is not a parallelogramwould be this one right over here , because none of the opposite sides are parallel.So parallelogram , opposite sides are parallel.So now let 's talk about , let 's talk about more types of four sided shapes , or quadrilaterals.So the next one we'll talk about is the rhombus.So the rhombus is a type of parallelogram.The opposite sides need to be parallel , but that 's not , by itself , that does n't make it a rhombus.The opposite sides need to be parallel , and all the sides have to be equal.So for example , this that I 'm drawing , that is a parallelogram , but it is not a rhombus.It 's a parallelogram because that side , these opposite sides are parallel.If they kept going , they would not cross each other.And these two opposite sides are parallel.So it 's a parallelogram , but it 's not a rhombusbecause the blue sides are longer than the yellow sides.So that is not a rhombus.A rhombus would have to look like this.A rhombus would have to look like that.So opposite sides are paralleland all the sides are the same length.And now you might say , `` Well maybe a square is a rhombus , '' and I want you to think about that.Is a square a rhombus ? Are all the sides the same length , and are the opposite sides parallel ? Well we already said that the opposite sidesof a square are parallel.A square is a parallelogram.And all the sides of a square are the same length.So a square is a rhombus.So one way to think about rhombuses , or rhombi , is they 're squares , and you could kind of view them askind of a pushed over version of squares , if a square was movingreally , really , really fast in a cartoon , that 's what my brain thinks of when I think of a rhombus.So now let 's think of rectangle.And you might have heard the word rectangle in the past , but let 's think a little bit moreabout what makes a rectangle.So a rectangle is going to be a parallelogram , but that by itself does not make it a rectangle.So for example , this right over here is a rectangle.Why is it ? Well it 's definitely a parallelogram.This side and that side are parallel.They 'll never intersect.And this side and this side are parallel.They 're never , they're never going to intersectif you kept going on and on and on , or they 're never going to cross each other.But what makes it a rectangle ? It 's definitely a parallelogram , but what makes it , why do we use the word rectangle ? Well one way to think about it isthey way that they come together at the corners.So in a rectangle , the things come in to , I guess you could call them square corners.And that 's called a right angle.That 's called a right angle right over there.So this is what makes a rectangle.It 's a parallelogram where all the corners are right angles.You could put a little square there , if you wan na think about it that way.So for example , this right over herewould not be a rectangle.Why ? Cause you ca n't , if you put a square here , notice.That does not , a square does n't fit in the cornersthe way that it fits right over here.That you have , the square does not fit over here.This is a parallelogram , but not a rectangle.A rectangle is a parallelogram that has square corners.But what about our square ? Is a square a rectangle ? Well let 's draw it out.Well let 's think about it.A square , opposite sides are parallel.We 've already said it 's a parallelogram.And a square has , the corners are square.That 's where when people say make a square corner , that 's where it comes from.The corners are square.They are at right angles.So the square is a rectangle.So the square is a really interesting quadrilateral , because a square falls in to all of these categories.The square , a square is a square , it 's a rhombus , it 's the type of rhombuswhere the corners are right angles , or you could say where the corners are square.This one right over here is not a square , this one is square.They 're both rhombuses , or they 're both rhombi.A square is also a rectangle.It 's a parallelogram where the corners are right angles , where they are square.A square is definitely a parallelogram , and everything we 've talked about is a quadrilateral .
