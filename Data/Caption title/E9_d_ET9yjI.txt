g day welcome tech math channel going look video looking looking last video trigonometry solve unknown sides work know inside first let quick recap last video look first name different sides trigonometric like right angle triangle use trigonometry couple different different sides angle call theta call hypotenuse side opposite theta cal led opposite adjacent side cal led h oh trigonometric oh going see ill put calculator calculator computer way dont particular one want see like youd hit view scientific notice three buttons sine cos tan lot scientific calculator aswell going three trigonometry follow sine k sine cos tan ratio follow way remember little pneumonic cal led cant always old age right old hag current always hack old age k theta sign going tobe around opposite hypotenuse going sine alternatively might theta might near chasing hypotenuse case use cosine theta opposite adjacent sides going touse tan k going solve unknown sides right first going put rule reckon tube going follow solve know label sides well work trigonometric well substitute value solve equation let right say particular problem nice looking problem beautiful problem look lot like k triangle right angle triangle little right back e theta going let call know side wish know opposite side going call x solve first label sign really follow really important know part first able label sign theta cal led hypotenuse opposite side theta opposite adjacent particular opposite hypotenuse might remember first often label well hit tree w function old hag current old age like going see dealing opposite hypotenuse side going well write let write properly rule going sine old hag opposite hypotenuse way actually write write sine sign white sign per say sine degree degree sis thing going sign equal opposite x hypotenuse right anything let get x orby well moment side dividing multiply ill able get rid also multiply side another way change want chuck another random little thing really handy thing would immediately get stuck actually write equation inhere equal divided mean number divided true yet also sort format trying find number x would trying find would multiply still going multiply two little trick use k work x going multiply sine third times let might scientific calculator going touse calculator scientific mode let well type hit decide times four answer go thats easy one start right let let go another example yes oh yeah thats answer let go another example going make necessarily going going cause one next one well one think ill easy ill try fairly random yeah yellow triangle fairly random well line theres actually little bit bigger see whats going put first make theta let make going going try work side x know side hand alright theres good little rounder one first let label sides long side hypotenuse thats going touse going opposite angle opposite well one running alongside adjacent sides workout treatment function old hag current always hack old age dealing dealing one thats hypotenuse one one thats ten let write nicely well get rid go going old degree equal opposite adjacent x similar sort thing wrote know one get x multiplying empty x going going rewrite thing three equal six divided two wont trying find one one get two go one divided one one divided one one divided one divided x equal one divided let calculator clear go divided tan equal six point six seven go one pretty good dont know hundred percent sure maybe want want might want put memory memory plus divided memory read equal six point six seven fact six point six eight going correct six point six one let one last example yeah hopefully clay making cause one know um well suspect cosmic maybe ill able making something thats close let look doesnt really matter tokay one last one triangle nice food lofty sort triangle big long sort triangle mean going one recall one degree si dont know fact let make close one would let working going go current always bit reverse engineering ked one going tobe adjacent one running alongside let make hypotenuse thats going tobe x right get teacher works little fish let go motion anyway work know going one let work anyway usual good good method label sides first opposite hypotenuse adjacent let work trigonometry know cant always pack old dealing always happy ideally good worked cause degree equal always seven x taking bit let get x going write similar sort thing three equal six divided two time one want want one one equal one divided one one divided one one divided one x divided cos ill let work divided equal seven point three six right cool seven point three six occasional look say thats actually hypotenuse make sense answer sort length pretty shallow sort angle going huge longer fairly reasonable sort answer go pretty good hopefully anyway next video going look work sides work much tweak similar sort hope see bye sin cos tan basic trigonometry working unknown sides sin cos tan basic trigonometry working
