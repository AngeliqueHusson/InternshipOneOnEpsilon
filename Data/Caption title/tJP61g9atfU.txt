welcome today id like address question basic question lot people trouble explaining inequality say less b apply negative number like negative one maybe negative negative b apparently rule meant flip inequality sign earth multiply negative quantity force flip sign thats question today right ordered ked question try set swim principle believe owner shave model suppose measurement like balance bag bag bag chilly less b b apple sin bag eight us actually put thing balance bag apple one side balance telling less apple therefore lighter b balance would balance would filled way right like believe model well add apple sides believe nothing scales hell tipped manner less b one one still believe inner cosine wave ever add another two still believe balanced tipped way guess id like believe plus x always less b plus x less b x sides preserve inequality let honest least x well wan ted add negative sides still believe mean negative going add negative apple anti apple sides anti left anti death right like negative one happen apple dapple guess really negative one like really mean take away apple take f sides yes id like believe still tip way well add anti apple sides take away two take away two add negative two sides still tipping way take away apple draw take simple go way still believe minus one going b minus one guess believe rule works x positive number believe x negative number guess gon na believe right else believe picture two bag picture gon na get messy suppose double number bag son left double bag rice bear gaze left two big bees right well silly two still light two piece still believe less b change inequality sign multiplying two triple number bag left right believe still going preserve inequality sign mop fraction suppose half theres half bag half bag b theres half bag b still believe thats gon na lighter even half less half b look like also delete convincing multiplying positive number inequality sign imbe ing honest positive number positive x guess negative x scar ing us right thats enough believe two rule forced conclude ill multiply negative quantity gon na flip inequality sign rule told memorize see actually true notice careful language choose two rule force believe could force operate following way negative multiply negative addition believe rule sit seem work apple least know let mathematician goes believe rule number one let go see happen sa would sun iva less b rule number one water add sides positive negative still preserve inequality sign sneaky gon na add anti bag believe rule less b minus add anti bag would sides corded rule preserve sign ill see happen negative b less negative thats thats pretty easy thats thats add subtract sides straight believe thats true start end flip insist ing still read b left right less b got b left right want rewrite left b right flip equation mathematical choosing right left bon right effect flip inequality sign reason integral assigned multiply negative prefer keep order first read thats basically swift algebra take away r b sides youve story thats flip sign want still thing left right right um thats negative one well high negative well thats usually tricky first might multiply negative two first multiply let write dont need pen suppose less b like believe rule true positive less b get negative negative power negative get negative greater negative b ago negative sense inequality sign multiply negative effect done first x doesnt anything inequality multiply sense flip holy son negative quantity believe game flip inequality sign got like weird physics question right brains like fun tal ked apple anti apple sand forth moment ago picture scale versus pen bag bead bag loo ked anteversion ante version b well aunt apple ante ever ante b apple trying say look auntie b thats bag apple lot apple way thats actual apple si guess anti apple must exact opposite weighed gravity bet wait gravity bank b apple beg auntie b anti apple know weighed less mean anti pul led less anti bes pul led lot draw skip draw scale picture anti apple making sense like rambling right pen gone lose pen anti bes pul led bag anti thats trying say guess picture guy see real physics question physicist believe anti matter actually possible sense still weighed gravity order mass get weighed gravity sense guess research question anti matter really anti apple mass thing pul led b lew pul led discussion emphasis last night dinner theres actually something yeah thats silly rant question end flip x negative number subtract sides subtract b sides forced conclude flip inequality sign three
