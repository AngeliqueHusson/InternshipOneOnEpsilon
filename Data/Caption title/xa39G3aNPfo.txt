[ Music ] the current population of America isabout 323 million people and all thesepeople 250 million are adults over 18now obviously we want to know thingsabout this population things like whatpercentage of Americans can identify thePacific Ocean on a map or whatpercentage of Americans do n't thinkexercise is important or perhaps moreseriously what percentage of Americansare happy with the direction of theircountrynow statistics like this are always funto read about and they 're always veryinteresting but you have to ask howexactly is it possible to know stufflike this if you dig into any of thosestatistics that I just told you aboutyou 'll find that they only polled maybea couple thousand people sometimes aslow as 500 people now not to put toofine a point on it but let 's say thisone dot represents a thousand peoplethen this is what 250 million or theentire adult population of America lookslike it gets even weirder though becausesometimes you 'll read a news story wheresay a politician 's approval rating havegone up by five points or gone down byseven points and you have to ask howexactly is it possible to validate sucha menu change by asking such a smallpercentage of the population andactually it gets even weirder stillbecause you 'll find that the claims areoften being made with a very highconfidence that they 're within a verylow percentage of the correct answer nowas unbelievable as all of this may seemthere 's actually a very beautifulmathematical justification for all ofthis and I 'm going to attempt to explainit now with a very simple example solet 's say we 're in a situation whereexactly half of Americans give apple piea thumbs down and the other half give ita thumbs up or another way to thinkabout it is if you were to ask allAmericans to rate apple pie eitherexactly zero or 100 then the averagerating for the whole country would beprecisely 50 now I do understand howunrealistic this scenario is but Iwanted to start with a simple example sois just humor me obviously it is tooprohibitive to go out and ask what everysingle American thinks of apple pie soif a scientist wanted to know what a verAmerican opinion about apple pie is theywould have to conduct a poll on somesubset of the population so let 's sayour scientist is a little stupid anddecides to conduct a poll on only oneperson then this one person will eithersay that apple pie is good or give it arating of 100 or give it a zero in otherwords apple pie is that and of coursethis is very useful since we alreadyknow the answer since we already knowwhat the proportions in society are weknow that picking one person at randomand just asking them will give you 150percent of the time and zero 50 percentof the time okay so let 's say ourscientist decides to be a little smarterand ask to independently and randomlychosen people what they think of applepie and then average their answers wellin this case there are threepossibilities either both people willgive apple pie a 100 in which case theaverage is 100 or they 'll both give it azero in which case the average is zeroor they 'll both give different answersand in both of those cases the averageis 50 now since we already know theproportions within society we cancompute the odds of each of theseanswers so we 'll get a 100 about 25percent of the time we 'll get a zeroabout 25 percent at a time and we 'll geta 50 about half the time because thatcan happen in two separate ways now ofcourse there 's no reason to stop at twopeople our scientists can keep averagingwhat more and more independently chosenpeople think about apple pie and if youdo this you 'll notice that thedistribution or in other words the oddsof getting different averages seems toconform to this beautiful shape called abell curve what 's nice about this is forone the distribution kind of seems topool around the correct answer or inother words the more people you ask thelikely it is you get an answer close to50 I mean it 's not certain so accordingto this chart there is a point twopercent chance that you get an answerbetween 70 and 72 which is obviouslynowhere near the correct answerbut there it is it is possible it iskind of insane that even if you just ask50 independent and randomly chosenpeople which by the way is an extremelysmall survey your odds of being within10 of the right answer are already 66 % you can kind of already see thishappening with just two people where ifyou remember there 's only one way to getan average of 100 or zero but twodifferent ways to get an average of 50by the time you start asking 50 peoplethough the effect is way more pronouncedthere 's still only one way to get anaverage of zero or an average of 100because in either case everyone has togive the same answer on the other handthere 's so many different ways you canget an average of 50 because there 's somany different ways for half the peopleto give a thumbs up and half the peopleto give a thumbs down and that explainswhy when you start averaging even asmall number of responses you 're way waylikelier to get something closer to 50and this also does seem to support theidea that perhaps you really do n't needyour surveys to be that big and ofcourse the situation will keep improvingas I keep taking the average of more andmore people however you might object andrightly so for one I started with asqueaky-clean situation a perfect 50/50split in the population but also evenworse than that even more damaging isthe fact that okay greatthis bell curve appeared and it lookswonderful but I was only able to knowthat the bell curve would appear becauseI already knew the answer like I startedwith the answer and did a bunch of mathto see what the distribution of theaverages looks like and I was able tofigure out that it was going to looklike a bell curve in the real world youare not going to know what thedistribution is like in the populationthat is the whole point of conducting apoll in the first placewhat if our situation is a lot morecomplicated than this so let 's say oursigns has still wants an average ratingfor apple pie but instead of a 50-50split within the population there is a70/30 split what if there is a 90/10split actually what could make thesituation way more complicated than eventhis so let 's say our scientist as partof his experimental design asks peopleto rate apple pie on a scale fromone two ten but two unbeknownst to himpeople in the population have a verycuriously specific opinion of apple pieso it could happen that 10 % of peoplegive apple pie a to but 20 % give it athree but 5 % give it a four and so on solike a very crazy distribution in thepopulation that our scientists isunknowingly walking into you would thinkin this situation the average would bevery hard to figure out through pollingand the distribution could look likeanything it could look like this itcould look like this it could look likethisit could look like this ah but here'sthe magic and the magic is called thecentral limit theorem and what it saysbasically I 'm omitting some technicaldetails but what it basically says isthat as you sample more and more peoplefrom a population no matter what thepopulation distribution is originallylike so no matter what the proportionsare like in the original population asyou sample more and more people andcompute the average of more and more oftheir answers you will see that theaverage is distributed like a bell curveso the proportions that you get for theaverages are going to look like abeautiful ever narrowing bell curve asyou sample more and more people now Icannot stress enough just how staggeringthe implications of all this are and itgoes way way way beyond just polling youcould be studying anything from theaverage lifespan of a tire to theaverage completion time of a video gameand what the central limit theorem tellsyou is that if you take the average ofenough independent and randomly chosensamples then you can approximate theodds of your average being within acertain amount of the population averagesimply by looking at a specific bellcurve and the fact that you can do thisregardless of what you are studying islike being handed broad-rangingstatistical superpowers now I should saythat the details of this approximationare contained within the technicalstatement of the central limit theoremwhich is a little bit beyond the scopeof this video however one implication isthatyou conduct an opinion poll with about athousand people then the bell curve thatyou would use to approximate thedistribution of the averages is sonarrow that 95 % of the time you aregoing to be within 4 % of the rightanswer which is why pollsters never seemto ask way more than a couple thousandpeople anything now before we get toofar ahead of ourselves I should say thatthey 're just an enormous amount of asubtle technical details and caveatsthat only a good a really goodstatistics course or a statisticstextbook can save you from for examplethe central limit theorem does n't reallygive you any information about howquickly a population distributionaverage will converge to a bell curveit 's also very very hard to getindependent and random samples withinthe population so for example if you'reinterested in conducting a poll and youdecide to do a phone survey then you'rebiasing all your data in in a way whereit favors people who are willing toanswer a phone survey and so there'sjust a lot of pitfalls that await anyonewho wants to conduct a survey even ifyou want to do it with a very highdegree of care and scrupulousness andthis is leaving aside the fact that Ido n't think most polls are conductedwith a high degree of care andscrupulousness my favorite example ofbad polling is illustrated in thispicture where Truman is holding a paperthat says he lost the election and ofcourse he 's holding it up during his ownvictory speech however even though it isdefinitely possible to misinterpret andmiss apply the results I think we shouldall be thankful that something like thecentral limit theorem exists becausewithout it of the truly subtleunderstanding of the world that we havewould not be possible that 's all I
