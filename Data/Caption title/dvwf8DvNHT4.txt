So you might have been wondering , `` How do I use the different quotient with fractions ? `` Well , the simple answer is , the same way you'd use it with any other type of function.But there is one small trick I 'll show you that 'll make finding the difference quotientfor a rational function a whole lot easier.So now we know that this is the formula for the difference quotient.With any difference quotient problem , we really only need two pieces : f of x plus h , and fof x.This second term , f of x , is just the function itself that we 're given.This first term , f of x plus h , is whatever we get when we replace x with x plus h inour original function.And regardless of the type of function we start with , whether it 's a fraction or not , we 're still just looking for f of x plus h and f of x.But let 's do an example where we find the difference quotient for a fraction , like thefunction 3 over x minus 2.Starting with the difference quotient formula , we can replace f of x with 3 over x minus2 , since f of x is always just the original function that we 've been given.Now all we need is f of x plus h.So we 'll replace x with x plus h everywhere in our original function , and we 'll get fof x plus h is equal to 3 over x plus h minus 2.Now we can plug this into the difference quotient formula for f of x plus h.Up to this point , this is exactly what we'd do for any kind of function , regardless ofwhether or not the function is a fraction.But here 's where the trick comes in.Once you get to this point , you need to start simplifying the difference quotient , but you'vegot what we 'll call the `` little fractions '' inside the `` bigger fraction '' .It can be confusing to simplify fractions within fractions , but here 's the trick todo it one easy step.You want to find a common denominator for the little fractions.So the denominator of the first little fraction is x plus h minus 2 , and the denominator ofthis second little fraction is x minus 2.The easiest way to find a common denominator is just to multiply these together.Do n't feel like you need to multiply this out ; the vast majority of the time it reallywo n't help you at all.Once you have this common denominator , you'll want to multiply both the numerator and denominatorof the big fraction by that value.You can do that , of course , because when the numerator and denominator are equal , the fractionis equal to 1 , so we 're really just multiplying by 1 , which of course does n't change the value.So now we just need to do some distribution.When we multiply the common denominator by 3 over x plus h minus 2 , it 'll cancel outthe x plus h minus 2 , leaving us with just 3 times x minus 2.When we multiply the common denominator by the 3 over x minus 2 , it 'll cancel out thex minus 2 , leaving us with just 3 times x plus h minus 2.And in the denominator we get h multiplied by the common denominator.And just like that , you 've eliminated the little fractions in one easy step.Now we can simplify the numerator by multiplying everything out , and then canceling terms.Finally , we 'll cancel out the h from the numerator and denominator.That 'll be our final answer , and that 's how you use the difference quotient with fractions.Could you use some extra help with math ?
