Hi ! Welcome to Math Antics . We 're continuing our series on Geometry and today we 're going to learn about angles.In our last video , we learned about points and lines , and that 's good because we are going to need lines to make angles.So let 's start with a couple of lines that are in the same plane.We 're only going to be dealing with two-dimensional geometry in this video . These lines are conveniently called Line AB and Line CD.Now the important thing to notice about these two lines is that they 're pointing in exactly the same direction . So , even if we extended them forever , they would never cross or even get closer together.When two lines are arranged like this , we call them 'parallel'.You 've probably heard the term 'parallel ' before¡­ like parallel parking , or a parallel universe , or parallel bars.Okay , so parallel lines are lines that will never cross , even if they go on forever ... but what if I take one of our lines and give it a little nudge ? Now the lines are n't parallel anymore . In fact , they cross at this point right here.Let 's name it Point P. When lines cross at a point like this , we say that they intersect , and we call the point an 'intersection'.And when lines intersect , they form 'angles ' . You can think of the angles as the spaces , or shapes , that are formed between the intersecting lines . These intersecting lines form four angles : 1 , 2 , 3 , 4.But instead of calling them angle 1 , 2 , 3 and 4 , in Geometry , we name them by the points used to make them.For example , this angle here can be called Angle DPB because if you trace along those points ( like connect the dots ) they outline that angle.And this angle here ... we can call that Angle APD , because connecting those dots forms angle.Now when naming angles , there 's a nice shorthand we can use . Instead of writing the word 'angle ' over and over again , we can just use the angle symbol instead , which looks like this.But there 's an even simpler way to name angles.To learn that way , let 's erase all the points and letters on our linesexcept for the intersection point and this one point here.Now let 's imagine that the line-segment between these two points can rotate around the point of intersection , just like a clock hand rotates around the center of a clock . Let 's also imagine that as we rotate the line segment , the point out at the end leaves a trail , like if a pencil was attached to it.The trail ( or path ) that is left when we rotate the line-segment all the way around forms a circle.But if we only go part way around , then it forms part of a circle that we call an 'arc'.This arc can represent the angle that is formed when we rotate the segmentfrom one position to another , like from this line to that line.And now , if we shrink down that arc so that it 's close to the intersection point , and then put a letter by it , like the letter ' A ' , we have another way of showing an angle ... Angle A.And we can do this with any angle , so the angle up here ... we can also draw an arc and call it Angle B.So whenever you see a letter next to a little arc like this , it means that it 's the name of the angle formed by that arc.Alright then , so now we have a diagram that shows Angle A and Angle B , and you might notice that those angles are n't the same size . B seems to be bigger than A.But what if we rotate one of our lines until the angles do look like they 're the same size ? Now our angles look kind of like a plus sign . Lines arranged like this are called 'perpendicular'.Perpendicular lines are lines that form square corners when they intersect.And these square corner angles have a special name in Geometry because they are really important.We call them 'right angles'.There is even a special symbol that we use to show when an angle is a right angle . Because they form square corners , we use a little square instead of the arc that we use for the other angles.So whenever you see this symbol , you know the angle you are looking at is a right angle , and that the lines that form it are perpendicular.Okay , now that you know what a right angle is , let 's look at a simple one that 's made from just two rays.What will happen if we take the ray pointing up and rotate it like the hand of a clocka little to the right¡­ a little bit clockwise ? Well , we do n't have a right angle any more because the rays are no longer perpendicular.Instead , we have an angle that is smaller ( or less ) than a right angle.Angles that are less than right angles are called 'acute angles'.On the other hand , if we rotated our ray to the left instead of the right , we would get an angle that 's bigger or greater than a right angle . Angles that are greater than right angles are called 'obtuse angles'.So , there are three main kinds of angles that you need to know about . Right Angles , acute angles and obtuse angles.Well actually , there 's one more type of angle that 's pretty important , but it 's kind of a strange one . It 's called a 'straight angle'.A straight angle is just what we get when we rotate our rays so that they point in exactly opposite directions.The result looks just like a straight line , which is why it 's called a straight angle.Alright then , there 's just a few more important geometry terms that we need to learn in this video . Let 's look at our simple right angle again that 's made from two rays.But this time , let 's draw a third ray that cuts that right angle into two smaller parts.Now , because the angle that we divided up was a right angle , we know that the two new smaller angles combine to form a right angle.And in geometry , any two angles that to form a right angle are called 'complementary angles'.And we can do the same thing with a straight angle . If we take a straight angle ( made from two rays ) and divide it with a third ray , two new smaller angles are formed.And those two angles combine to form a straight angle . We call these angles 'supplementary angles'.So , complementary angles combine to form a right angle , and supplementary angles combine to form a straight angle.Alright , that 's all were going to learn about angles in this video.And if you are new to Geometry , it might seem like a lot , so let 's do a quick review of all the new geometry words we 've learned.Lines that point in exactly the same direction will never cross and are called 'parallel ' lines.When lines do cross , they cross at a point called an 'intersection'.Lines that intersect form 'angles ' . You can think of angles as the spaces between the lines.Angles can be named by the points that form them ... just like connect the dots.An 'arc ' is a part of a circle . Arcs can be used to represent an angle between two intersecting lines.When intersecting lines form all exactly equal angles , the lines are 'perpendicular'.Perpendicular lines form 'right angles ' . Right angles are square corners , and we use a special square symbol to show that an angle is a right angle.An angle that 's smaller , or less than a right angle is called an 'acute angle'.An angle that 's bigger , or greater than a right angle is called an 'obtuse angle'.A 'straight angle ' is formed by two rays pointing in exactly opposite directions . A straight angle is really just a straight line.Two angles that combine to form a right angle are called 'complementary angles'.Two angles that combine to form a straight angle are called 'supplementary angles'.In our next geometry video , we 're going to learn more about angles and how to measure them.Thanks for watching Math Antics , and I'll see you next time !
