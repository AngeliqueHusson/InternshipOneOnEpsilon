today we 're going to be talking aboutthe unit circle and the reason I wantedto talk about this is because it 's asuper important topic there were onlyone concept that I could pick that Iwanted to remember from precalculus ortrigonometry that I would need forcalculus it would be the unit circlebecause we use it so often and thebetter you have the unit circlecommitted to memory the easier calculusis going to be on you and the reason isbecause we are looking at the angles onthe unit circle all the time so todaywe 're going to talk about how toremember the unit circle and how we'regoing to use it in calculus now when itcomes to building the unit circle we'reinterested in three things first of allwe 're interested in the coordinates so Ihave an image here of the unit circleover on the right hand side what we wantto do is label the coordinates at eachone of these places where we have a lineintersecting the circle and we 'll talkabout that more in a second we 're alsointerested in the angles of each ofthese lines and we 're interested in theangles in both radians and degrees sowe 're going to say angles in radians wewant to label those and then we alsowant to be able to label angles indegrees so we have angles in degreeslike this and we 're going to do these indifferent colors so we can keep track ofthem and more or less we 're going tolabel this unit circle build this unitcircle in this order we 're going to lookat coordinates first then angles inradians then angles in degrees so whenit comes to building the coordinates outalong this unit circle the first thingwe want to remember about the unitcircle is that it 's called the unitcircle for a reason the reason isbecause the radius is equal to one unitso when we 're talking about this pointhere the unit circle is centered at theorigin so this point here is the point 00 the unit circle is always centered atthe origin and the radius of this circleis 1 so R equals 1 and that 's thedistance between the origin here at 0 0and this point here so this distance isR equals 1 the radius is equal to 1 andthat 's why it 's called the unit circlebecause it 's one unit so since we knowthat since it 's called the unit circlewe know that if we 're going out adistance of one here along the x axisright since this is centeredthe origin this is the x-axis here whichwill right here and this is the y-axishere so if we 're going out a distance ofone along the x axis in the positivedirection of the x axis then thiscoordinate point right here is the point1 0 we 've gone out a distance of 1 alongthe x axis but we 're still at 0 in termsof the Y value so the coordinate pointis 1 0 now similarly over here we couldlabel this point negative 1 0 becausethe radius is the same on the left handside of our circle now if we want tolabel our coordinate points along the yaxis we have the point here 0 1 our xvalue is 0 but our y coordinate is now 1or this point here 0 negative 1 andthese are called our major axes rightour x axis and our Y axis so we'velabeled those coordinates now we canlabel the coordinates of these otherpoints now these are a little bit moretricky and you can actually derive themusing the angles associated with each ofthese lines but what we 're going to doright now is just give you a way toremember them and the way that you'regoing to remember them is you 're goingto label each of these with itscoordinate point here we 're going todraw big parentheses and we 're going tosay give us two fractions both over towhere the denominators are both equal totwo same thing here / 2 + / 2 and samething here / 2 + / 2 like this and thisis a really common way that we rememberthe unit circle and then what we'regoing to do once we have this is we'regoing to write 1 2 3 down like this onthe x coordinates and then 1 2 3 goingup here along the Y coordinates now ourlast step is to take the square root ofeach of our numerators so when we takethe square root of one right here thesquare root of 1 is still 1 so we leaveit the square root of 3 we can'tsimplify so we have to write the squareroot of 3 ca n't simplify the square rootof 2 so we square root both of thosesquare root of 3 and the square root of1 is just 1 and these are the coordinatepoints associated with each of thesepoints right here so we have 1 2 & 3points and their associated coordinatepoint values there once you have thecoordinate points for the first quadrantit 's really easyto find the coordinate points for theother three quadrants because we justchange the sign of the coordinate valuesso for example if we move over to thisquadrant here our X values are all goingto be negative because we 're in negativeX territory here but our Y values areall going to be positive so we can sayhere for this point here that the xcoordinate is going to be a negativeroot three over two we 're just borrowingfrom this point over here because we'removing directly across so the xcoordinate is now negative but the ycoordinate is positive here we 're goingto have a negative x coordinate sonegative root 2 over 2 positive root 2over 2 and then here we 're going to havea negative x value of negative 1/2 and apositive Y value of root 3 over 2 likethat if we move down here to thisquadrant we 're going to have positive xvalues but negative Y values so if welabel these here we 're borrowingdirectly from the first quadrant here soa positive x value root 3 over 2 and anegative Y value so this positive 1/2here becomes negative 1/2 and for thispoint we have a positive root 2 over 2 xvalue and a negative root 2 over 2 yvalue and for this point we have apositive x equals 1/2 and a negativeroot 3 over 2 for the Y value and thenour last quadrant again here we 're goingto have both coordinate values benegative so the x value will be negativeand the Y value will be negative sowe 're going to get negative root 3 over2 negative 1/2 here we 're going to getnegative root 2 over 2 and negative root2 over 2 and here we 're going to getnegative 1/2 negative root 3 over 2 sothose are going to be the coordinatepoints for our unit circle now we wantto look at angles in radians well againin the same way that we started with thecoordinate point 1 0 out here along thex axis in the positive direction we'regoing to start with the same point forthe angle in radians so we 're talkingabout the angle and radiance here theangle is going to be 0 we always startwith the angle 0 in the positivedirection of the x axis and then we movecounterclockwise around the circle likethis sopositive radiant angles are going tooccur in the counterclockwise directionso we 're going to move this way and whatwe 're going to realize here is that ifwe go the full circle we know that ourangle is going to be two pi so when weget all the way back to the beginningthe angle is two pi so this is going tobe zero or two pi right here and ofcourse if the entire circle is 2 pi thenjust half of the circle right here isgoing to be pi now from here we can saya quarter of the circle we 're justworking backwards here if half of thecircle is pi then a quarter of thecircle is going to be half of pi or inother words pi over 2 if we want thisangle here out along the negativedirection of the y axis we know that wehave pi plus another quarter of thecircle we know a quarter of the circleis PI over 2 so pi plus PI over 2 is 3PI over 2 so this ends up being 3 PIover 2 and that makes sense becauseagain if we start from zero and we countout by half a PI each quarter of thecircle we get to 1 PI over 2 then 2 PIover 2 which simplifies to PI then 3 PIover 2 then 4 PI over 2 which simplifiesto 2 pi so we just count by 1/2 PI oneach quarter of the circle now we canlook at our PI over 4 terms if we take1/2 of PI over 2 if we split thisquarter of a pie into an 8 then we canget this half angle right here as PIover 4 because half of PI over 2 is PIover 4 and now we just count up againhere we start from 0 we have 0 we have 1PI over 4 to PI over 4 which justsimplifies to PI over 2 then we have 3PI over 4 right here 4 PI over 4 whichjust simplifies to PI 5 PI over 4 here 6PI over 4 which simplifies to 3 PI over2 and then 7 PI over 4 like this gettingfinally here 2 8 PI over 4 whichsimplifies to 2 pi now for the last partof this we need to know that this anglehere is not 1/2 of PI over 4 it 's not PIover 8 this is actually 2/3 of the anglePI over 4 notice that this line here isclosedto the angle PI over 4 than it is to theangle 0 and in fact it 's 2/3 of the waytoward PI over 4 so this area here isdouble this area right here now we canjust remember that that 's PI over 6 orof course we can take PI over 4 andmultiply it by 2/3 and what we get is 2PI over 12 which is equal to just PIover 6 and that 's how we know that wehave pi over 6 here we can also find PIover 6 because we know that this angleis 1/3 of the angle PI over 2 and here'swhat you can see you can notice thatthis distance right here is 1 thisdistance here is 2 and this distancehere is 3 notice how they 're all equalthese distances are all equal that tellsyou that this pi over 6 angle is 1/3 ofthis pi over 2 so we could always takehere PI over 2 divide it by 3 that 's ofcourse equal to PI over 2 times 1/3which is equal to PI over 6 so that'sanother way that we know that this is PIover 6 and now we can just count up wehave 0 then we have 1 PI over 6 thisline here is going to be 2 PI over 6 orPI over 3 when we simplify it 4 PI over6 which of course just simplifies to PIover 2 to PI over 6 which of course justsimplifies to 2 PI over 3 5 PI over 6here which we ca n't simplify all the waydown to 6 PI over 6 or just PI now herewe get 7 PI over 6 8 PI over 6 or 4 PIover 3 9 PI over 6 or just 3 PI over 210 PI over 6 or 5 PI over 3 and then 11PI over 6 all the way up to 2 pi whichis 12 PI over 6 and that simplifies ofcourse to 2 pi now we 've marked off ourangles in radians let 's go ahead andlook at our angles in degrees again herewe said that this angle was 0 in radiansit 's also going to be 0 here in degreesor 360 when we go around the circle onefull time remember that one full turn is360 degrees so zero and then all the wayto 360 and we 're just going to attackthis the same way that we went aboutangles in radians we 're just going totake half of 360 and say that the anglehere is 180 we 're going to take half ofthat and say that the angle here is 90we 're going to go halfway between 180and 360 and we 're going to get 270 andof course this makes sense because whenwe start with zero and we add 90 degreesat a time we get 90 180 270 360 now wecan cut each of those in half and we cando the 45-degree angles so half of 90 is45 this angle right here is 45 degreesif we start from zero and count up by 45we get zero to 45 to 90 to 135 righthere to 180 to 225 here to 270 to 315 atseven PI over four and then back to 360adding 45 to 315 gets us back to 360 nowagain here we know that this first angleis one-third of this 90 degree angle soninety divided by three gives us 30 weknow that that 's 30 we can also say twothirds of 45 that also gives us 30 so wesay 30 there we start at zero and wecount up by 30 so zero up to 30 then wehave 60 90 120 150 180 210 240 add 30get to 70 add 30 get 300 add 30 get 330add 30 we 're back to 360 so those areour angles in degrees and that 's how webuild our unit circle from memory nowwhy is this so important in calculuswell we 're going to use the unit circlefor a million different things but themost common way that we 'll use the unitcircle is will be presented withsomething like cosine of PI over 3 andasked to evaluate this this will come upin a problem in calculus and we 'll needto figure out what the value is ofcosine of PI over 3 wellwhen we have the unit circle each of ourcoordinate points here represents cosineand sine of each angle so thesecoordinate points are not just XYcoordinate points they 're actuallycosine theta sine theta coordinatepoints what we mean by that is that thex value represents cosine of the angleand the Y value represents sine of theangle so if we look here at our firstangle PI over six if we have cosine ofPI over six we can find pi over six andsince it 's cosine take the x value ofthat coordinate point so cosine of PIover 6 would be root 3 over 2 sine of PIover 6 would tell us to find the PI oversix angle and then take the Y value ofthe coordinate point so sine of PI over6 would be 1/2 in the same way here ifwe have cosine of PI over 3 we find theangle PI over 3 and then since itscosine we take the x value and that's1/2 so this is equal to 1/2 and we canuse the unit circle to simplify thiswhat about a different example whatabout if we have sine of 3 PI over 4well we find the angle 3 PI over 4 westart at 0 here and we look for 3 PIover 4 here it is we 're looking for sineof that angle so we take the Y valuesince we have sine that 's positive root2 over 2 so that 's equal to root 2 over2 so we can simplify that way well whatif we have tangent of 3 PI over 4well we need to express thistrigonometric function in terms of sineand cosine we know that tangent is equalto sine over cosine so what we get hereis sine of 3 PI over 4 divided by cosineof 3 PI over 4 and then we can grabthese values from our unit circle sosine of 3 PI over 4 we go here to theangle take the Y value since its signand we get root 2 over 2 cosine of 3 PIover 4 we go to the same angle and takethe x-value since it 's cosine which isnegative root 2 over 2 and we can seethat these will cancel and we 'll just beleft with negative 1 so tangent of 3 PIover 4 simplifies to negative 1 awell things to note about the unitcircle we can also use it to find anglesthat are greater than two pi so eventhough these radian angles only go fromzero all the way around to two pi ifwe 're given for example cosine of 3pi wejust count around right so cosine of 3piwe 're going to get one pi right we findhere one pi so we go start at zero goaround to 1 pi 2 piback to 3 pi and this is where we end upback at this angle pi again so ending uphere because we have cosine of 3pi welook at the x value and the x value isnegative 1 so this is equal to negative1 you can also do it this way if youhave an angle that 's greater than 2 piyou can subtract 2 pi from the angle andyou 'll always get the right answer so 3pi minus 2 pi is just pi cosine of piand of course that 's what we had beforewe know that that equals negative 1 soyou can either count around like this 1pi 2 pi 3 PI or you can subtract 2 pifrom the angle until you have an anglethat 's less than 2 pi the last thing iwant to mention is that we 've talkedhere about positive angles when we movein the counterclockwise direction wehave positive angles so when we starthere at 0 and we move counterclockwisewe get positive PI over 6 positive PIover 4 positive PI over 3 etc but we'reactually going to encounter negativeangles a lot as well especially when wedeal with parametric and polar curves incalculus when we do we 're going to movein the opposite direction so for exampleif you 're asked to find sine of negativePI over 4 like this instead of moving inthe positive direction to PI over 4we 're going to move in the negativedirection by PI over 4 radians sonormally we would start at 0 here and wewould move counterclockwise in thepositive direction of the angles to PIover 4 this point right here until weget to PI over 4 well we 're going tomove in the negative direction the samedistance so we 're going to come out hereto this corresponding point to negativePI over 4 and we can see that negativePI over 4 is equal to 7 PI over 4 sosine of negative PI over 4 is the samething as sine of 7 piover four and either way because we'retaking sine of the angle we look at they-coordinate here and we can see thatboth of these are equal to negative roottwo over two the y coordinate of thispoint so if we have a negative anglejust start at zero and instead moveclockwise in the negative direction thesame distance you would have moved inthe positive direction to find thepositive version of that same angle test
