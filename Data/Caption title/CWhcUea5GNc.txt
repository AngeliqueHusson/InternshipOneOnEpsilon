hi everyone going show little trick today make look like mathematical genius going able add whole bunch together instantaneously impress idea going get volunteer going ask pick two number snow works two everyone sake might want keep fairly small might say keep ten twenty something like volunteer pick two number snow turn away ask volunteer write two one say pick write column like ask add together write result underneath theyre going write plus like make fourth number well add third one case plus theyre going carry like want ten ask write column ten like write plus get going get next number look amazing finish get practice simple arithmetic get turn back look instantaneously going able write sum draw line tell sum look cool trick look fourth number bottom fourth number bottom case take number multiply thats final answer fourth number case work well tell might thinking gosh start multiplying instantaneously going let show easy way multiply actually quite easy multiply show got three example herein case looking fourth number bottom going multiplying first example weve got multiply add two together put middle start end add two together plus put middle correct answer thats sometimes going carry like second example number want multiply add two together get going put middle instead end like add two together get going put carry add become correct answer case three digit number idea really example weve got begin end middle add together add last two give add first two example got another thats finish want show another way work sum wan ted add n number snow notice sequence mean number sum previous two sequence start carry doesnt start way could pick two thing done say wan ted add first n sequence let say start first number well call want add together want way last call equal well theres formula formula equal toit n plus number minus second number formula word wan ted work sum first n couple couple step subtract second step answer prove induction fan prove induction hard check base case true assume true arbitrary step make sure true n plus step prove formula case let see first ten continue sequence couple eleventh step twelfth step add ten eleven together get look true twelfth step minus second step sum first like said little trick bit math sand start practic ing multiplying show friend sand thanks watching sum trick sum trick sum trick sum trick sum trick sum trick sum trick sum trick sum trick sum trick sum trick sum trick sum trick sum trick sum trick sum trick sum trick sum trick sum trick sum trick sum trick
