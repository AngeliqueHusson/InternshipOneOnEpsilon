oh class work practice ladies tal ked tal ked two tal ked sum interior angle n minus two times polygon measure one interior angle n minus two times n right problem say one angle worth measurement formula think going want use sum measure one angle thus measure one angle give measurement one angle going worry telling us pretty much measure one angle equal going say right equal n minus times divided n us find sides represent sides n represent number sides right need solve n going back algebra class variable get variable isolated right well first thing need need get denominator get denominator inverse operation use amber n multiply n sides therefore n minus times degree n divided n goes apply distributive property therefore n minus variable sides get variable get variable sides go add subtract get side usually like late gentle men know subtract subtract get side subtract n therefore going give negative equal negative yes could subtract add side problem either n n one way really choose divide negative therefore anybody anybody well step times would times n equal every individual angle equal degree equal degree name five sided figure pentagon good positive negative determine number sides regular polygon given one interior angle determine number sides regular polygon given one interior angle determine number sides regular polygon given one interior angle determine number sides regular polygon given one interior angle determine number sides regular polygon given one interior angle
