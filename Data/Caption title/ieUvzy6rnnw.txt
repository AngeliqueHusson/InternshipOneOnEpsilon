a solar eclipse is an absolute delight to behold and so i 'm going to show youthe mathematics behind how we can predict when they 're going to happeni 'm recording this before the 2015 eclipsebut do n't worry the information I'm giving you now remain valid for at leastthe next nine hundred and eighty-five yearsas you may have noticed the moon is not transparentthis means that blocks the light from the Sun and it casts a shadow occasionthat shadow moves across the earth and if you 're standing with a shadow fall'syour witness a total solar eclipse from our point of viewthe moon has moved in front of the Sun and completely blocked its light for asolar eclipse to work thoughthe moon has to be big enough to block out the Sun and believe me this diagramis not to scalein reality the moon is 400 times smaller than the Sun but in a fantastic cosmiccoincidenceit 's approximately three hundred and eighty nine times close-up on averageand that 's close enoughit means from our point of view the moon is almost exactly the same size as theSun in the skythis means it will line up and it will completely block the disc of the Sun ifthe moon with any smaller or any further awayit would n't be big enough from my point of view to cause total solar eclipsesbut of course it could be bigger and it could be closer and would still geteclipses but fantastically because the apparent size of the moon matchesexactly the apparent size of the sun's photosphere the bright surface of thesun it blocked out the bulk of the light from the Sun but it does n't block theSun Thank atmosphere as you can see from this photograph taken in a total solareclipse the Sun has a very faint atmosphere with fantastic structure init this is normally swamped by all the photons coming from the rest of the Sunonly because our eclipses line up so welldo we ever get to see it we are incredibly lucky that from our point ofview the size of the moon matches exactly the size of the SunI mean the probability of that happening is literally astronomicalit may look like the Sun the Moon move around randomly in the sky but that'snot the caseeclipses occur based on the some earth-moon system the earth orbitsaround the sum and the moon orbits around the earth and its when those twoorbits come into alignment and bring the moon between the Sun and the earth thatwe get a solar eclipsealthough i should point out of course once again that diagram was in no way toscare in fact there 's pretty much nothing in this videothat 's to scale to illustrate what happens during a solar eclipse here ihave the earth and you 're going to be the Sun so your line of sight of therays of sunlight coming out of your face or whichever part of your body you shootthe Sun shines out of and then it hits the earth except of course when the moongets in the white as it orbits around the earthit causes eclipses and the moon orbits the earth every 29.5 3059 days and sothere you have itthis is why we get a solar eclipse every 29 days 12 hours 44 minutes and threesecondsunfortunately it 's not that simple of course physics is n't that simplethere 's actually more than one type of lunar month poor exactly the same orbitso for a startthe moon does n't go around the earth in a circle actually follows an ellipsewhich means at different pointsthe moon is different distances from the plant and its closest point it 's 3603396 kilometers away from the earth and its greatest distance its 405,000 504now the month i mentioned before the 29.5 three daysthat 's the time the moon takes to be from the point where its closest to theSun back to being closest to the Sun again a different month is 27.5 fivedays and that 's the time the moon takes from being at the closest point to theearth back to being at the closest point to the earth and the difference there isalmost two days and the reason for that two day discrepancy is because theelliptical shape orbitduring the movies 21.5 five-day lap around the earth the earth has n't stoodstillit 's orbiting the Sun it will have gone for about 30 degrees of its orbit whichmeans even though the moon is back at the same point relative to the earthit 's no longer the same point relative to the Sun it has to go a little bitfurther to go between Sun and the earth once more and that 's where the experttwo days comes from but it 's not always the same amount of time because themoon 's elliptical orbit tracks with the earththe direction is pointing changes relative to the Sun so different pointsin the year it takes more or less time for the moon to once again go betweenthe Sun and the earth that time I gave you before the 29.5 three daysthat 's just an average but it 's okay we can factor this all in we can do thecalculations on the elliptical orbit of the moon as the earth goes around theSun and we can calculate how often the moon goes between the Sun and the earthunfortunately it 's not that simple yepthere was a third type of lunar month so you 're the son here we have the earththe earth is orbiting around you in a fixed planethe man however orbits around the earth in a different planeits orbit is tilted at 5.1 degrees from the earth orbit around the sun and thisis why we do n't get an eclipse every single monththe moon has to both be going between the Earth and the Sun as well as eithergoing down through the Earth 's all that or coming back up again and that is ourthird type of lunar monththe amount of time between the moon going down through the Earth 's orbit- when we get back to the same . and there is 27 . - 12 21 days the shortestmonth yet and this explains why eclipses are so rare we only get just over to ayear in fact we average 238 solar eclipses per century but now we 've goteverything sorted we can calculate when they are unfortunately it 's not thatsimpleremember themand elliptical orbit around the Earth but that does n't stay stilleither it actually drift by 40 points 7 degrees every year so it rotates onceevery eight point eight five yearsyes the moon 's orbit orbits and so the two points where it crosses the earth orbut drift around the earth over the course of eight point eight five yearsand only when the moon goes between the Earth and the Sun while one of thesenodal points is also between the Earth and the Sun will we get a solar eclipseunfortunately it 's not that simpleany second now unfortunately it 's not that simplethere 's so much more to take into account the Earth 's orbit of coursethat 's not a circleit 's no lips as well and a lip that also moves it rotates once every 20 and ahalf thousand years and the u.s. gravity is a nice and tidy all knowfor a start the earth is in a perfect sphere it 's an oblate spheroid on top ofthat it 's covered in water and the title drag messes with everything and thenthere 's the gravity between the moon and the Sun so far already take into accountthe gravity between the Sun and the year and then separately between the Earthand the moon but of course it 's a gravitational pull between the moon andthe Sun in fact the mutual gravitational attraction between the Sun and the moonis over twice that between the Earth and the moonthe direction the moon is traveling relative to the Sun makes a bigdifference on its speed and that is constantly changing in fact every singlenumber i have given you in this video every direction every speed every angleevery time they 're all only approximations their averages the wholesystem is constantly changing it is a wonder we have eclipses at allwhat this means is we ca n't make any meaningful proper long-term predictionsabout solar eclipses but for the reasonably near future we can and NASAhave gone through all of the years between negative 1999 and positive threethousand they have analyzed all 60 1841 lunar months that 's from New Moon to NewMoon and they 've checked all eleven thousand eight hundred and ninety-eighteclipses and put all the data up on their website but to the undrained Ijust watching it happeningwe 're back to a random movement of the Sun and the moon in the sky andoccasionally they happen to cross but then out of all this chaosanother cosmic coincidence steps forward to save the datejust like the moon 's apparent size happens to match the sun 's apparent sizethere is one special combination of the three different types of Lunaand that happens to line up perfectlyif you take 220 three new moon months so from closest to the Sun the closest tothe Sun and you compare that to 239 of the month between the closest point ofthe earth to the closest point of the earth and then you compare those two 242of the months between when the moon goes through the Earth 's orbit back to winour next goes through the earth orbitall three of those are pretty much exactly the same length of time they allcome out spot on 18 years 11 days and eight hoursand so it means if out of all this random movement you somehow have a solareclipseyou know that 18 years 11 days and eight hours later we will have had an integernumber of all the different types of months in bold and so we will return topretty much exactly the same geometrythere will be another very similar eclipse 18 years 11 days and eight hourslaterit 's called the sarah cycle and allows us to predict when eclipses are going tohappen in the reasonably near futureexcept of course unfortunately it 's not that simplethanks you 're welcomein 2009 july twenty second i was lucky enough to witness the total solareclipse when the moon shadow came across the Pacific Ocean through Japan acrossmainland China and then out through India because of the Saros cycleI know I can enjoy the next equivalent to clips in 18 years 11 days and eighthours time and it will look like this in the year 2000 27 on august secondexcept those eight hours are about a third of the day and so the Earth'srotation wo n't line up everything else willbut the earth will have spun about another third of a rotation so theeclipse will actually happen over here and then another Sarah cycle later in2045 on august 12it will be another third of a rotation across and it will go through Americaand this cycle can also be worked backwards before the 2009 eclipse is onein 1991 then 1973 1955 1937 1919 and 1901 you notice that over time theeclipses are actually working their way up the planet and that is because of theslight mismatch of the Saros cycle with the rotation of the moon 's an ellipticalorbit around the Earth and it means that the eclipses gradually drift further andfurther norththis particular Sarah cycle Sarah cycle 136 actually began on the fourteenth ofjune in the year 1360 on that day there was an eclipse right down near the SouthPole is now gradually been working its way up across the planet and the verylast one will occur on the thirtieth of july in the year two thousand sixhundred and twenty-two right up at the North Polethere are currently 41 active Sarah cycles working their way up or down theplanetso there you have it the maths and solar eclipses is an absolute mess becauseorbits are really complexcated however we do know solar eclipses are amazing to watch if you can go andsee one do of course be safe and don't blind yourselfand bear in mind that they 're not gon na be around forever partly because themoon is gradually moving further away because of that title drag actuallydrifts about 3.7 centimeters throw away from the earth every year which means itabout point six billion years it will be too far away to cast a shadow on ourplanet but apart from that we have no idea what the orbits will be like thatfar in the future according to our best simulations in the next five billionyearsthere 's a one-percent chance that mercury will leave its orbit and eithercrash into Venus or the Sun in fact there was a nonzero chance that in threepoint three six billion years the gravitational force from Jupiter werenot mercury out of its orbit in turn will impact on Mars that within slaminto the earthso you know enjoy eclipses while you canfor more math behind solar eclipses and all sorts of diagrams and calculationsand plots and things that I can possibly fit in this video 's google checkoutNASA 's five millennium canon of solar eclipses i 'll put a link to it in thecomments below is based on the fantastic work of thread s been ax and
