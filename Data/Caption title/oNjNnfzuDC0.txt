welcome Greek scholars of ancient timesaround 500 BC in Lebanon words justrelative delight and playing withnumbersthey found great beauty and greatstructure and great mystery and they'rejust the simple counting numbers and thesource things have looked at withnumbers and their factors and then I wasin the curious things happens withnumber six number six is factors one twothree and six but I 'm gon na ignore thewhole number itself and just add up theremaining numbers one plus two plusthree is back to 628 histor propertyelicits factors 1 2 4 7 14 I 'll ignore28 itself add up the small factors of 28was troopers 4 7 plus 7 is 14 plus 14inspectors being 28 the next number withthis property is 496 you can check thosefactors adapt itself 8 1 8 1 2 8 sincethe next and so on and they thoughtthese numbers perfect numbers whosefactors in or the whole number itself edup data itself and the Greeks playedwith this and there are many questionsthat they ask that are still unsolvedtoday for example no one knows that thelist of perfect numbers goes on foreverall the numbers the Greeks found tryingto be even no one to this day is getfound an odd perfect number nor hasproven that one ca n't exist and and allsorts of questions exist but the Greekswere very clever and there is thisperfect numbers seem to have anotherproperty for example 6 we 've alreadyseen that 's one plus two plus three andit 's called the third triangle number 28it turns out to equal 1 plus 2 Plus 3plus 4 plus 5 plus 6 plus 7 all thenumbers elephant 1 2 7 that 's called theseventh triangle number 496 turns out tobe 1 plus 2 3 go all up to 31 they'retensed this let 's call the 31st Tranwere number 8 128 is 1 plus 2 basstreated at a go all the way up 227 127thPerot triangle number and notice 3 is 1less than 4 how to sevens 1 less than 8a pair of two 31 smile muster 32 what wesaw was a tree in fact these are allprime numbers that are one thethe power - these are the Mersenneprimes so have a little look at thevideo on Amazon Prime 's where I talkabout those so it looks like every thesedo even says the only example was Godtriangle a perfect number is triangularwith a index PMS n prime so what I'dlike to prove now is prove this fact youcould made one step but he managed toprove I did n't need to crease the spaceagain that if a number is of the formand whoops with my pen ends of the formto the P times two to the P minus 1 allover 2there 's a form of the triangle number ifthis guy turns out to be prime then thenumbers perfect and I can leave that asan exercise for you it was until ordercame along some 2,000 years later theymanaged to prove that every even numbereven perfect number must be a perciformand that 's what I 'd like to do todaylet 's go take a little bit of work andit 's gon na be hard I 'll sit rang greasereconstruct the proof of my head as wego along and we 'll just see what happensso what I 'm gon na do is prove that everyeven perfect must in fact be triangularhere goes I needed a spin so let'sdouble the number n now every number hassome truth analysts say is I know nminus 1 to s in it and equals somethingtimes an odd and since it 's even I'mgonna assume there 's at least one two inthis group here so we write everynumbers of how two times it times an oddnumber great and let 's suppose thefactors of M 1 the Sun effective am andit 's called D 1 up to D K and the wholenumber M itself so they 're the factorsof M then it asked was the factors of nso we 're gon na assume this is perfectthat is its factors if for the wholenumber itself add up to itself that itmeans all this list is to itso what are the factors of 2 to the nminus 1 times M well often got all thefactors that of M so I 've got 1 plus D 1plus D 2 that a plus Mlet me call that s+ I 've got two timesthose and take one of these twos and doall this factors so double this one plusd2 up to em that 's two S 's plus I 've gotif I were to take two of these 2 's forthem for one plus d2 it up to em there'sanother for SS all the way up to thewhole power of 2 itself 2 to the n minus1 times it one of each of these factorsof M and there 's another s so thefactors of M if I add them all togethersome 2 's plus 2 's plus 4 s all about 2to the N minus 1 SS common factor of s 1plus 2 to deter plus 2 to the N minus 1assuming we 're familiar with thegeometric series or we know how powersof 2 workthis is actually s times 2 to the nminus 1 on 2 minus 1 s times to the Nminus 1so he goes S is the sum of the factorsof M and we 've just proved that the sumof the factors of n is s times 2 to theN minus 1 all right that 's quick andmessy but there we gowell if the numbers perfect if I sum allthe factors of n all of them includingthe whole big 1 itself I am going to getn plus the whole big factor itself ifthen I was perfect the sum of all thesmall factors up to n plus X 2 N andthis equals s times 2 to the N minus 1apparentlywell that is 2 times n is s times tolittle n minus 1 and what was N wellthere 's a formula for it shove that in 2to the N times M equals at s times 2 tothe N minus 1 so got this equation toplay with I 'll play with it tada I wishI had a huge screen right now so havinga huge screen I 'll just use a differentcolor pen all right let 's play with thisa little 4s that is remember yes withsome of the factors of n whoopssome of the factors of M got to get myenunciation right so s would be come tothis formula two to the N times M overto the N minus 1 well I 'm going toactually make the numerator look likethe denominator by going through the Ntimes M minus M plus M all over to the Nminus 1 because I 've got a common factorof M there if I pull that out I 'm leftwith M times to the N minus 1 to bedivided by 2 in thus once it 's M plus Mover 2 to the N minus 1 so there thereis a formula for the sum of the factorsof M well this is mighty strange becausesome of the factors of n M sorry that'san integerwhoops was n't a pen that 's an integertherefore we 've got no choice but thishas to be an integer that is M must bedivisible by 2 to the N minus 1 so Icould write M is M over to the N minus 1times 2 to the N minus 1 that is I'llcall this thing a and I 'll call thisthing BI 've now factored M as a times B well Iclaim we 're in a bit of a pickle rightnow because what have we got we 've gotthat this equation in green I 'll writethis down dark green says that s is Mplus the thing I caught a there is thesum of all the factors of M all of themis M plus a hang on I know I know whatthis guy that 's definite one of thefactors of M and I know that one is afactor of M where is it and if M isactually product two things where 's thefactor B I 'm in a bit of a pickle I knowone has to be in the sum and I know B tobe this in the sum the only way out ofthis pickle if is if a is in fact onethat would it be it which means M is 2to the N minus 1 that is so I have toconclude that a is 1 so M is to the Nminus 1 which means for m to be big andto be perfect n must be the form 2 nminus 1to the N minus one which exactly what Iwanted new clothes form to the N to theN minus 1 all over 2it must be triangular I 'm actually I goa little bit further we 've now deducedas a is one that s is M plus 1 this isalso telling me that M only has twofactors itself and one because rememberis sum of all the factors and there'sonly two of them here therefore s mustbe prime so not only must n be of theform 2 n minus 1 it must be a prime ofthis form we 've just proven that M mustbe a mess n prime that 's it for a numberto be even and perfect it must be of theform a triangle number of the form T tothe N minus 1 that is with the indexhere 's a mass M Prime just as wediscovered early on so that 's oileroiler back in the civilian hunters didthis approach clever clever guy Perfect Numbers
