welcome another number monster infinitely many th th gap promise end last video today mission show visual way seeing transcendental pretty convinced far transcendence specific goes put together simple accessible ever get still make end understand argument think bepretty p roud since many professional transcendence proof make end got special treat show use number template clone real within clone made transcendental like strange cousin pi perhaps clone although large set measure sense take space within real know set closely related cantor transcendental number well detailed introduction watch last video real quick transcendental defined term among real encounter classical algebra like integer rational real written rooty real pop solution integer coefficient like last set cal led algebraic include type integer rational anyway call real number transcendental algebraic solution polynomial equation number shown great one first shown transcendental proof fact probably easiest transcendence proof specific number accessible anybody exposure proof university level real analysis links original modern version description since many would struggle proof tried come alternative way seeing transcendence number understood hopefully also anybody watch es sort fan still high school still working primary school version probably never going get number lots lots th th quick reminder equal times equal times equal sequence grow rapidly stretch es consecutive get longer longer extremely quickly proof number transcendental let know whether proof works dealing complicated number like pi approximate value often suffice good place start get approximation often chop decimal expansion point let approximate number pi squared square approximation pi squared spot onto certain digit may good enough application mind however point go target example last approximation coincide pi squared first four see number l behave quite different respect start cut first four truncation l squaring give contrast squared truncation seem tobe correct look deceiving actually always true hard nonzero spaced apart line simply n play role ear lier square number moment gloss technical detail return proof anyway raise l different power well see still definitely damn good thing longer spot example one digit wrong three look closely find next approximation spot correct actually thing swill spot truncation truncation correct fact something similar true seen spot turns case cube fourth fifth weve already seen certain truncation thing sixth except happen little bit later instead power look polynomial positive integer coefficient plus es minus es right instead number l polynomial like evaluate l find approximation correct truncation onwards particular case polynomial correct onward getting pretty close punch line remember demonstrate l solve equation like get proof going first move negative term right side result two positive term one left one right side equal sign let assume l actually solution polynomial equation mean number left equal sign actually equal number right call number number top let see get left right replace l one truncation let start work way obviously higher truncation better approximation number top get left right also know addition approximation correct truncation sake argument let say case onward mean first digit approximation left equal first digit approximation right second digit left equal second digit right well expect one two sides run nonzero side keep going alright maybe exactly happen however surprisingly see go technical point assumption equation also starting possibly higher truncation let say always run nonzero time approximation mean two approximation fact equal truncation onward mean like l following infinitely many truncation also solution polynomial equation infinitely many different solution impossible polynomial equation many solution degree example degree polynomial solution assumption number l solve polynomial equation lead absolutely impossible conclusion polynomial infinitely many solution mean assumption l solve equation like wrong first place mean lis transcendental number neat proof contradiction right course show approximation eventually spot matter polynomial equation dealing let closer look different number l stand different example first one stand minus second minus third minus number l sum star ted pondering l squared let look would calculate number actually let calculate square second truncation multiply every term top one bottom add minus times minus minus minus times minus minus times minus times minus add everything get square l squared multiply every term top every one bottom add might take right minus minus minus minus minus minus minus minus minus minus minus square truncation correct well rightmost digit comes multiplying rightmost term truncation term interfere square truncation one term outside box top one term bottom least big number make way lot smaller danger critical next truncation also danger gap exponent minus minus even less danger one gap even one liner show actually leave sort detail well actually get partial credit take one line let shave look fourth truncation fifth power l next thing loo ked right said correct fourth truncation let double check yes green yellow tick leave fill show also case higher truncation remember problem lower let see show order wrong approximation one step also trouble green term interfering power second truncation first l squared like highlight gap yellow lo west squared truncation together corresponding term already observe gap increasing fact get arbitrarily large true appear ing truncation onward calculation ear lier already convinced fact polynomial positive integer coefficient well built take example l squared plus l highlight truncation first note corresponding green top one essentially comes multiplying bottom one shift one position anyway relative alignment always move right also move towards right gap front green large wish given gap clear add squared none green beyond add sum within l squared approximation correct happen individual polynomial non trivial positive constant example let multiply linear term something huge say overall effect change term nonzero island possibly growing green shifting left may lead overall gap front green shrinking even vanishing really large coefficient like however since unlimited size eventually absorb shrinkage gap swill always present certain point mean matter polynomial dealing approximation spot certain truncation onward almost final part proof assumed l solve polynomial equation like one claim certain point onward truncation also solve equation give contradiction well see certain truncation say onward usual common gap term equation identity left true assumption sum two approximation top must equal sum two bottom exactly convince anyway thats basically course could still fill nitty gritty calculation example ever growing gap made sure able fill detail couple super cool fact shown way first even base always transcendental number second even replace get transcendental number long infinitely many nonzero integer transcendental number give number still transcendental maybe someone prove comment transcendental number give new transcendental number five point one two zero zero zero fun idea let take real number like pi use create new number like well super tough prove pi transcendental whereas proving transcendence weird clone harder sho wed k next trick let real number create clone set within set real consist entirely even clone algebraic transcendental little bit careful translate number feature decimal expansion like example number decimal expansion would also result clone decimal expansion number like rational therefore transcendental course easily fixed every number decimal expansion second decimal expansion infinite tail nine example equal alternative decimal expansion feature infinitely many nonzero give transcendental clone well one problem remains number can not way give transcendental number quite often little exception big deal anyway got clone real within real consist ing transcendental course since clone original set word like real clone uncountably infinite set course addition element easy transcendental super cool right however uncountably infinite set also paradoxical property zero although large whole set real well hidden within sense even really able appreciate paradoxical set watch previous video also give little assign length measure subset real could head infinite series also sort set moment prepared proof fact clone measured zero think video already getting quite long put proof next couple days let finish hope understood video usual please
