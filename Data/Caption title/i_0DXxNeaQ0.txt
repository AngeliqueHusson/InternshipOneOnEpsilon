piano arpeggio thing move tend hit thing sand thing move pluck string back forth air molecule around push air literally hit ting much getting close comfort get ear push stuff send signal brain say hey getting pu shed around experience sound string pretty special vibrate certain way certain speed little sister swing get timing right take certain amount time complete swing every time basically time push es length time even general push es make swing higher higher amplification try push frequently end pushing swinging instead going higher dampen vibration thing string want swing certain speed frequency sing pitch sound wave singing push string right speed amplify vibration string vibrate string cal led sympathy vibration ear work firstly got ear drum get pu shed around sound wave sand push es ear push cochlea fluid sending wave fluid instead wave air follow concept swing thing fluid goes long tunnel membrane cal led basilar membrane viola string tight er higher pitch mean faster frequency basilar membrane stiff er beginning tunnel gradually get looser high beginning cochlea goes whole spectrum low note sat end fluid start getting pu shed around certain frequency middle c certain part ear vibrate sympathy part thats vibrating lot going push another kind fluid half cochlea fluid hair get pu shed around fluid theyre like hey middle cand getting pu shed around quite bit also human least straight tube cochlea awesomely spiraled upo k cool make note c instrument ear like hey c c different depending whether sing play viola theres mathematics swing pushing exactly true pushing frequency swing swinging way get swing swing could push every swing though swing would n go quite high pu shed every time would still swing pretty well fact instead pushing every time half time could push every three swing four whole series timing work though height swing amplitude get smaller cochlea one frequency goes n part vibrate lot another part like vibrate twice fast wave push every time make vibrate theres another part vibrate three times fast four whole series sending signal brain somehow perceive single note would make sense let also say frequency thats twice fast one time would vibrate place first note though maybe strongly overlap youd think would make brains perceive two different almost even though far away keep mind go back probably know whole theorem thing also famous took string note let scall c since proportion wan ted see note string would play made length length found note octave higher thought pretty neat tried next ratio string full length c length would give note g octave fifth next ratio try string already figure note would string c octave would c another octave would another octave higher string would make note e wait let play c major figure one ratio already third g g octave check new note prime found times times give us c three octave go octave fifth octave fifth get closer closer chromatic scale go semitone e let make one thing clear magic relationship mathematical ratio consonant interval sit sound good ear ear hear every vibration reach es cochlea every single note major chord secretly certain interval sound consonant tonality like culture music independently still similar scales chord tonality cal led overtone series way physics n really know string twice fast hey make series series meaning swing like swing times second octave twice frequency e three times original frequency thing series making string vibrate different length sat different string actually vibrating different n hold n notice higher usually lo west pitch subsume say put finger right middle string ca n vibrate n actually hold string string would free vibrate way doesnt move point could n vibrate touch point expect overtone divisible get hear cool part string pushing around air different air pushing around different basilar membrane vibrating sympathy ear put together understand one sound say hey got big vibration pretty strong pattern viola make sit difference loudness give note different timbre simple sine wave single frequency overtone make oh sound like flute reedy nasal sounding instrument shave power higher make different vowel mouth shape overtone coming vocal cord dampen ing amplify ing demonstrate corded saying oh ah ay going put low pass filter less play back filter make overtone series going audacity create sine wave make another twice frequency octave alone play back pitch play two hear two separate pitch es brain say hey two pure octave apart higher one must overtone lower one really hearing one note play back pitch let add next times give us play back pitch es like different instrument fundamental sine wave pitch let add wrong plus better keep going happy see individual sine wave highlight one little bump see first overtone perfectly two bump sand next three four way knowing speed sound per second seeing wave take second play multiply find distance one wave shown actual length c sharp foot octave frequency twice length mean lo west c piano five octave lower c sound foot times fee play timbre sound loud overtone relative ear right pretty complicated sound wave get added together single wave export file see look like suppose could graph anyway headphone shave little diaphragm push es air make sound make shape push es forward fast wiggly thing another big push forwards speak remember pushing air ear sit bump air bump air air bump ear drum way diaphragm speaker push es little push cochlea push es fluid depending stiffness basilar membrane point either going push basilar membrane way make vibrate lot push little hair push es wrong timing like someone bad sound wave push way part ear send signal pretty easy see get pu shed wrong direction sometimes push es right direction make different added together separate mean time many signal sare sent noise like sound voice sound rain traffic noisy neighbor air conditioner brain like yo look found pattern fit together series starting pitch think one thing different thing fit pattern v voice oh boy car horn somehow still pretty far listen lots sound separate thing anywhere well ear brains brains good finding sometimes find especially subconsciously looking noisy situation fact pattern mostly brain fill blank sand make hear tone exist got overtone play pitch going mute frequency hear pitch es even though lo west frequency brain like well got overtone close enough let mute highest overtone one one timbre pitch leave one left somehow removing higher note make apparent pitch jump good measure play sequence pitch es try given us simple ratio string law physics sympathy mathematics sine wave add hidden every spoken word every song hear bird song bees buzzing car horn infant sand time dont even realize symphony screeching halting train open listening ear perfected hundred millions year capture exquisite detail wonder make sense pattern mathematics order finding beauty noise science mathematics sound
