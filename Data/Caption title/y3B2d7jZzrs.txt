okay so as I mentioned ladies andgentlemen if any time you see atrapezoid and they 're talking about thearea meaning they give you the area orthey 're asking for the area right downthe for fill of the area of a trapezoidsay trapezoid equals 1/2 times heighttimes base one plus a base to notice thebase one place to our inside theparentheses so we have to add them upbefore we apply multiplication so nowlet 's go and see let 's determine what isit we have well in this problem theygive us the area right so we could say aand some U then they give us base 1 andbase 2 you do n't think we do n't know isH which represents our height so let'splug all those in so we have 1/2 times 8times 6 point 4 plus 13 so I get implieswhat we 're trying to do now solve for Hokso what I recommend is let 's go aheadand combine these in the parentheses soI have 78 equals 1/2 H times 6.4 those13 is 19.4agree yeah I agree with you now I canmultiply this I give you nine nineteenpoint four times one-half or if you guyswant to divide it by Kalu is it okay ifI rewrite so it looks like that is fivetimes four that 's four times fiveyeah just waiting right so looks likethat so now I need to be able todetermine what is 1/2 a night do n't put4 you can use your luck letter or youcan use your brain and say be nine pointseven what is it nine point seven now Ihave nine point seven two five times Hso to undo multiplication zeth you haveto do therefore H equals I do n't knowthis one maybe I 'll ask for a blank tohelp me out H equals 8 8 8 equals usethe other thing with something okay if Ibring over thatall right now I am what you How to determine the height of a trapezoid when given the area and bases How to determine the height of a trapezoid when given the area and bases How to determine the height of a trapezoid when given the area and bases
