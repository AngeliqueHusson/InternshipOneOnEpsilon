Show 109 % by shading.So just as a bit of review , 109 % if we were to write itout , would literally be 109 percent , which is the samething as 109 per -- and I could write cent again , but that'sgetting old.Cent means 100 , so it literallymeans 109 per hundred.If you had 100 per 100 , you're dealing with the whole , butnow we have more than a whole.We have 109 per 100.We can actually write this as a ratio , or as a fraction.This is the same thing as 109 per 100.It 's the the same thing as 109/100.So let 's shade that in.So we have a whole here , so we could considerthis square a whole.In the last video , we counted.This is a 10 by 10 square.It is cut up into 100 pieces.So if we want 109 of those 100 pieces , whatare we talking about ? That means we 're going to shade in all of the100 right over here.Let me do that in a new color.So we 'll shade in all of this.If you just shaded that in , that would be 100 % .That would be 100/100 , or 100 per 100 , or 100 % .I think you 're getting the meaning of all of this.I do n't just want you just memorize this stuff.This really just means 100 out of 100 , or a whole.And you can see that this is the whole square.That 's 100 out of 100 right there.The question is saying show us 109 % by shading.We already did 100 per 100 , but we need to do another 9 , so let 's shade in another 9.So now we have one , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight , nine.So this piece right here , you could almost view that is -- well , that is ! That is 9 % of an entire square.This is 100 % of an entire square.If you considered this whole thing plus this blue arearight over here , you are talking about 109 % of onewhole square.Hopefully , that made sense . test
