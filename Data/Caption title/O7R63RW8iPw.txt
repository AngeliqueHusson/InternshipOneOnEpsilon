good evening stats fans it 's time againfor stat Center presented by theMichelson 20mm foundation I 'm Robert adude of yay math org swag and tonightwe 're talking conditional probabilityand contingency tableshome-field advantage is a very realfactor in sports no one can deny theeffect of the crowd the cheers for thehome team the jeers for the away team orif you 're in a fair-weather city or apoor weather city maybe it 's just theoppositeeven the familiarity of the stadium orarena makes a difference but exactly howbig is that difference and how can wemeasure it joining me tonight forinsight is no stranger to the sights andsounds of America 's sports complexesplay-by-play sports commentator MikeGreene Mike home versus away how do wecalculate a team 's chances conditionalprobability Robert bang just a fancy wayof saying we 're going to measure thechances of an event occurring withcertain conditions needing to be truetake a look at the Los Angeles Angels ofAnaheim in a recent season the Angelsplayed a total of 162 games anyone athome and anyone away angels were 52 and29 at home at 46 and 35 on the road Isee you 're displaying these data on acontingency table just a first name forthe list of different scenarios and theprobabilities associated with them ithelps identify the conditionalprobabilities relatively quickly sinceit displays the relevant information ina straightforward way there are twoqualitative variables in the datawhether the game is a win or loss andwhether the game is home or awayquantitative variables in the tablewould be the number of Wiz and losses soif we wanted to find the angels chancesof winning a home game using probabilitynotation we 'd say P or the probabilityof a win given that it was a home gamewith the vertical line representing whatis given and to the right of the linewhat true conditions needto be back to the table we see theAngels 152 of there anyone home games sothe probability of winning a home gameis 52 out of 81 or 0.6 for that is 64 % bang yes bang what about the probabilityof winning and away game which I takewould be expressed as the probability ofa win given that it was an away gameAngels won 46 out of 81 away games sothe probability is 46 out of 81 or 0.568meaning just around 57 % positive you didwhat about determining of all the winsthe probability that it was a home gameyou mean P or the probability of a homegame given that it was a win equals 52home game wins / 98 total wins or 0.5 31about 53 % way to go oh I 've got a gameto cover if you have any sharbat pleasebring it off for next time bang what'sit in green out test
