how can we find the area of a regularpentagon it looks something like thisall five sides are equal and all fiveangles are also equal to each other weare used to finding the areas oftriangles and squares but how do we findthe area of such figures let 's see letthis be the center of the pentagon bythe center I mean it is equidistant fromall the five vertices by joining thecenter to the vertices we can see thatfive triangles are formed but are all ofthem equal think about it if they arefound to be equal then all we need to dois find the area of one triangle andmultiply it by five to get the area ofthe entire Pentagon we have also seenthat every regular polygon has anincircle which looks like thisthis circle touches each side at exactlyone point then there 's a circum circlewhich passes through every vertex of thepolygon if you observe the figurecarefully as all these five lengths areequal they will be the radii of thecircumcircle it means that this is thecenter all of the circumcirclewhich makes it the center of theencircle - as they are always concentricso the center of both the circles is ohlet 's name the polygon ABCDE a B C D andE let the lengths of all sides be equalto a remember first we have to find outif all the five triangles are equal orcongruent and then if they are we canmultiply the area of one triangle withfive to get the area of the Pentagon letthe lengths of the sides be equal to awe will be focusing on this triangle thebase of this triangle is a units and tofind the area oftriangle we also need its height what isthe height look at the height or P andthink for a moment it 's the radius ofthe in circle which is called the inradius let the length of the in radiusbe R units so length of Opie will equalR units now we have all things necessaryto find the area of the triangle let'szoom out a bit and find out what thearea of triangle Oh II D equals we knowthat the area of a triangle is given byhalf base into height the bases a unitsand the height is our units the areawill equal half multiplied by amultiplied by our guess what this willbe the area of every triangle the heightof each triangle will be R which is theinradius and the base of each trianglewill be a which is the length of eachside of the Pentagon since there arefive triangles in this Pentagon thetotal area will equal five multiplied byhalf AR we cut the area of this Pentagonin terms of its sides and in radius as amatter of fact this formula can begeneralized if there are n sites in aregular polygon the total area willequal n multiplied by half AR if we wantto calculate the area of a regularhexagon we would substitute six in placeof n if regular octagon then eight andso onyou test
