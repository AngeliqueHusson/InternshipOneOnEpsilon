Sarah has $ 48.She wants to save 1/3 of her money for a trip.How many dollars should she set aside ? So we essentially want to think about what 1/3 of 48 is.Use 48 as the denominator and find anequivalent fraction to 1/3.So what they want us to do in this problem is they want usto say , OK , we want 1/3 of her money , but we want to writethis as an equivalent fraction where we have 48 in thedenominator.So this is equal to something , some blank up here.This is equal to something over 48.So how can we get it to that something over 48 ? So let 's think about what this means for a second.So 1/3 , if we were to draw 1/3 , it looks like this.You could imagine a box or a pie , I guess.So let 's say that this is my pie , and I have it split intothree pieces.So let me split it into three even pieces.And 1/3 is one of those three pieces.That is what 1/3 means.Now , if we want express this as a fraction over 48 , how canwe do that ? Well , we 're going to have to split thisthing into 48 pieces.How can we split something into 48 ? Well , 3 times 16 is 48 , so if we split each of these into 16pieces -- and it 's going to be hard to drawhere , but you can imagine.Let 's see , you split it into two , now we 've split it intofour , now you split it into eight.You 're just going to end up with a bunch of lines here , but you can imagine , you can just split each of these.If you split each of these into enough , you would have 16pieces , so those would be 16 right there.You would have 16 right there and you have 16 right there.And I can just keep doing it.Let me do it in the green over here.So if we just kept splitting it up , we would get 48 , because you have this first third would be 16 pieces , thesecond third would be 16 , and then this thirdthird would be 16 pieces.Altogether , you would have 48 pieces.Now , that 1/3 , what does that represent ? Well , that represents 16 of the 48.It represents these 16 right here.It represents these 16 right there , so 1 over 3 is theexact same thing.So 1 over 3 is the exact same thing as 16 over 48.Now , we did it just by thinking about it kind ofintuitively what 1/3 of 48 is , but one way to do it more -- Iguess a process for doing it -- we would say , well , look , toget the denominator , the bottom number , from 3 to 48 , we multiply by 16.3 times 16 is 48.And that 's literally the process of going from 3 piecesto 48 pieces.We have to multiply by 16.We have to turn each of our pieces into 16 pieces.That 's what we did.Now , you ca n't just multiply only the denominator by 16.You have to multiply the numerator by the same number.And so if each of my pieces now become 16 pieces , thenthat one piece will now become 16.So one way to think about it , you just say , well , 3 times 16is 48 , so 1 times 16 will be my numerator , so it 'll be 16.So 1/3 is equal to 16/48.And another way you could think about it , which you'lllearn in more detail later on , is we want 1/3 of 48 , right ? That 's how much she wants to save . 1/3 of 48 is equal to1/3 times 48.And when you multiply -- let me write it like this -- 1/3 times48 , and you could rewrite 48 as a fraction 48/1.It literally represents 48 wholes.And when you multiply fractions , you can justmultiply the numerators.So this is equal to 48 over -- and then you just multiply thedenominators.48/3 , 1 times 48 is 48.We 'll see this in more detail in the future.Do n't worry about it if it confuses you.In the denominator , 3 times 1 is 3 , and 48 divided by 3 , or48/3 , is equal to 16.So 1/3 of 48 is 16 , or 16/48 is 1/3.Hopefully , that make sense to you .
