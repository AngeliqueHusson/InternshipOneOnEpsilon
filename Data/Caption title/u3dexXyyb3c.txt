professor hey professor today going look introduction distributive property course weve got get char lie better ready hey char lie ready go char lie ya professor right go right distributive property distributive property going going distribute number across addition subtraction multiplication let give example times plus plus parenthesis get distributive property could add two see get order supposed thats coming soon watch take whats parenthesis plus plus char lie char lie professor forget whats operation outside parenthesis operation written assumed char lie multiplication professor multiplication times char lie char lie professor times problem going demonstrate distributive property notice theres outside parenthesis outside parenthesis mean youve got multiply dont add whats parenthesis first add plus going going distribute multiplication watch first start times well bring times parenthesis operation addition well bring take multiply thats times distributed operation multiplication whats times char lie char lie professor times whats times char lie professor times anyway whats plus char lie char lie professor notice two answer exactly course probably saying going parenthesis first yeah cant time see know ever going use distributive property well see soon problem times plus somebody technique going go ahead show times plus basically mean two plus added together true plus plus plus add order want remember add order want reorder plus plus plus plus way looking whats times plus parenthesis fine example havent dis cussed variable yet class going demonstrate right distributive property add x plus parenthesis people think x plus want repeat class char lie char lie huh professor x plus add two actually mean times x well get later x plus cant add stuck apply distributive property distribute x times x written mean times x operation addition parenthesis well bring well take times char lie char lie professor cannon add plus answer took times parenthesis x plus applied distributive property end plus well dealing little later semester dealing lot beginning algebra next let look subtraction parenthesis parenthesis first whats subtract char lie professor multiplying give let apply distributive property times operation subtraction bring char lie times professor times thats right right times char lie char lie professor bring subtraction times char lie professor whats subtract char lie professor answer well go next one going distributive across subtraction addition process take times bring operation subtraction times going addition times righto kay let times char lie char lie professor subtract times char lie professor add times char lie professor nice remember youve got work left subtract char lie char lie professor still got add get char lie professor nice char lie problem could answer could gotten first operation subtract plus times would faster trying demonstrate distributive property well let times let think well first let break expanded form times plus distribute whats times char lie char lie professor addition times char lie professor give another way looking times lot us tend want use vertical format soon going see vertical format reason distributive property exactly times first thing taught char lie char lie times professor times yes see distributive take char lie times professor go diagonally go times bring notice put place actually plus vertical format watch let complicated times get going write expanded formin expanded form char lie whats char lie plus professor thats plus plus apply distributive property get first char lie times professor times operation whats next char lie times professor times char lie char lie professor times times char lie times char lie professor work left right plus plus answer let vertical format going vertical format without carrying see mean watch first start times char lie char lie professor thats distributive property times notice place written place bring place holder go times hundred place hundred put place add together first column char lie char lie professor carry plus plus thats without carry overwell let finish lecture carry go char lie pay times carry times right add put carry times plus go thats vertical format vertical format distributive property go thats introduction distributive property going work multiplication future anyway keep
