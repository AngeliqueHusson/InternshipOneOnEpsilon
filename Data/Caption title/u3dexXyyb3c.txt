> > Professor Perez : Hey ! This is Professor Perez again.Today we 're going to look an introduction to the distributive property.Of course , we 've got to get Charlie out here.He better be ready ! Hey , Charlie , you ready to go ? > > Charlie : Ya ... > > Professor Perez : All right , here we go.Right here.Introduction to the distributive property.So , what the distributive property is , is what we 're going to do , is we 're going to distribute a number across an addition or a subtraction using multiplication.Let me give you an example here.2 times 5 plus 3.Notice the 5 plus 3 is in parenthesis.Before we get to the distributive property , what we could do is add the two numbers in the parenthesis.You 'll see when we get to the Order of Operations , that that is what we 're supposed to do first.Okay , that 's coming up soon.So watch . We take what 's in the parenthesis , 5 plus 3.What 's 5 plus 3 , Charlie ? > > Charlie : 8. > > Professor Perez : 8.Do n't forget we have a 2.Now what 's the operation , Charlie ? It 's 2 outside of a parenthesis.There is no operation written down , so it 's assumed to be what ? > > Charlie : Multiplication. > > Professor Perez : Multiplication.And so , 2 times 8 is what , Charlie ? > > Charlie : 16. > > Professor Perez : 16 , same as 8 times 2.Now , same problem , but now we 're going to demonstrate the distributive property.Notice there 's a 2 outside the parenthesisthat 2 outside the parenthesis means you 've got to multiply.But , you do n't have to add what 's in the parenthesis first , you can add 5 plus 3 , but what we 're going to do is we 're going to distribute the 2to the 5 and to the 3 by multiplication.Watch , Charlie.We first start with 2 times 5.So we 'll bring that down.We did 2 times 5.And now , in the parenthesis our operation was addition , so we 'll bring that downand now we take the 2 and multiply to the 3 and that 's 2 times 3.Notice the 2 was distributed to each the 5 and to the 3 and operation is multiplication.And now , what 's 2 times 5 , Charlie ? > > Charlie : 10. > > Professor Perez : 10 , same as 5 times 2.And what 's 2 times 3 ? > > Charlie : 6. > > Professor Perez : 6 , same as 3 times 2.And anyway , what 's 10 plus 6 , Charlie ? > > Charlie : 16. > > Professor Perez : 16 and notice the two answers are exactly the same.16 . Now , of course , most of you are probably saying , `` Well , I 'm just going to do the parenthesis first . `` Yeah , but you ca n't do that all the time , you 'll see.Because I know you 're asking , `` When am I ever going to use the distributive property ? `` Well , you 'll see very soon.Now , same problem , Charlie.2 times 5 plus 3.Now somebody mentioned this technique to me so I 'm going to go ahead and show it.2 times 5 plus 3 basically means you have two 5 plus 3 's a being added together , which is true , okay ? And 5 plus 3 plus 5 plus 3 , you can add in any order you want.Remember adding numbers ? You can add in any order you want and we can just reorder itas 5 plus 5 plus 3 plus 3 which is 10 plus 6.Which is again , 16.Another way of looking at what 's 2 times 5 plus 3 in parenthesis , which is fine , okay ? Now , here 's the example we haven't discussed variables yet in this class , but we 're going to demonstrate it right now with this distributive property.Now , you can not add x plus 3 in the parenthesis.Some people think that x plus 3 is 3x.No it 's not 3x.It is 3x if you want to repeat this class , Charlie. > > Charlie : What ? Huh ? > > Professor Perez : Okay , x plus 3 , you can not add those two together.3x actually means 3 times x , we 'll get to those later.But , x plus 3 you ca n't add.So , are you stuck ? No . You can apply the distributive property.You can distribute the 2 to both the x and to the 3.So , 2 times x is written 2x.2x means 2 times x . And our operation is additionin the parenthesis so we 'll bring that down.And we 'll take 2 times 3 which is what , Charlie ? > > Charlie : 6. > > Professor Perez : 6 , okay.You cannon add 2x plus 6 and that is your answer.So , you took 2 times the parenthesis x plus 3 , and applied the distributive property and then end up with 2x plus 6.So , we 'll be dealing with that a little later in the semester and you 'll be dealingwith that a lot in Beginning Algebra which is the next class.Okay , now , let 's look at a subtraction in the parenthesis , Charlie.Let 's do the parenthesis first.What 's 7 subtract 3 ? > > Charlie : 4. > > Professor Perez : 4 and you're multiplying by 2 which does give you 8 okay ? Now let 's apply the distributive property.What do you , Charlie ? Distribute 2 times 7 is ... okay ... and your operation is subtraction so bring that down.And then what ? > > Charlie : 2 times 3. > > Professor Perez : Okay , 2 times 3 , that 's right.All right , now , we did 2 times 7 is what , Charlie ? > > Charlie : 14. > > Professor Perez : Okay , bring down your subtraction , 2 times 3 is ? > > Charlie : 6. > > Professor Perez : 6 , and what 's 14 subtract 6 ? > > Charlie : 8. > > Professor Perez : 8 , same answer , okay.Now we 'll go to this next one.Here we 're going to distributive across a subtraction and an addition.Same process.We take 2 times 7 , bring down your operation which is a subtraction , and then we have 2 times 3 which is ... going to be 6.Bring down our addition and then we have 2 times 2 , right ? Okay , so let 's do 2 times 7 is what , Charlie ? > > Charlie : 14. > > Professor Perez : Subtract 2 times 3 > > Charlie : 6. > > Professor Perez : Add 2 times 2. > > Charlie : 4. > > Professor Perez : Very nice , okay.Now remember , you 've got to work left to right.14 subtract 6 is what , Charlie ? > > Charlie : 8 ? > > Professor Perez : 8.We 've still got to add the 4 and what do we get ? > > Charlie : 12. > > Professor Perez : Very nice there , Charlie , yes.Now , the problem could have been ... uh ... the answer could have been gottenby first doing the operations in the parenthesis.7 subtract 3 is 4 , and 4 plus 2 is 6 , and 2 times 6 is 12.Yes , that would be faster , but we 're tryingto demonstrate the distributive property , how it can be used.Okay , well , let 's do 2 times 43.Well , let 's think about how do we do this.Well , first , let 's break the 43 in the expanded form , okay ? 2 times 40 plus 3 and if we distribute the 2 through , what 's 2 times 40 , Charlie ? > > Charlie : 80. > > Professor Perez : 80.And we have an addition , and 2 times 3 is ? > > Charlie : 6. > > Professor Perez : 6 and that gives you 86.So this is another way of looking at 2 times 43.Well , a lot of us tend to want to use this vertical format.What you are soon going to see is this vertical format , the reason it works , is because you 're using the distributive property.It 's exactly what you 're doing , watch.43 times 2.The first thing you are taught to do is do what , Charlie ? > > Charlie : 2 times 3. > > Professor Perez : 2 times 3 which is 6 , yes.See ? It 's the distributive property.2 multiplied by 3.And then you take the what ? > > Charlie : 2 times 4. > > Professor Perez : Go diagonally and go 2 times 4 , which is 8 and you bring it down.Notice you put the 8 in the tens place because you have 8 tens , which is actually 80 and so 86 is just 80 plus 6.That 's your vertical format.Watch , let 's do a more complicated one.Let 's do 6 times 134.Do n't get scared ! What we 're going to do is write 134 in expanded form.In expanded form Charlie , what 's 134 ? > > Charlie : 100 plus ... > > Professor Perez : That 's right.100 plus 30 plus 4 , okay , now , apply the distributive property.What do we get , Charlie ? What do we do first ? > > Charlie : 6 times 100. > > Professor Perez : 6 times 100 is 600.Bring down our operation.What 's next ? > > Charlie : 6 times 30. > > Professor Perez : 6 times 30 which is what , Charlie ? > > Charlie : 180. > > Professor Perez : 180 , because 6 times 3 is 18 and 6 times 30 is 180.Okay , Charlie , 6 times 4 is what ? > > Charlie : 24. > > Professor Perez : 24 , okay.So we work left to right , 600 plus 180 is 780 plus 24 which is 804.that is the answer.Now , Let 's do the vertical format.Now , we 're going to a vertical format without carrying over.You 'll see what I mean.Watch , we first start with 6 times 4 which is what , Charlie ? > > Charlie : 24. > > Professor Perez : 24 , that's the distributive property.And then we do 6 times 3 which is 18.Now notice , the 3 was in the tens place , so the 18 , the 8 is written in the tens placeand we bring down a place holder , 180.And then we go 6 times 1 which is 6.It 's in the hundreds place , we have 6 hundreds and we put in our place holders thereand you add them all together and the first column is what , Charlie ? > > Charlie : 4. > > Professor Perez : 4.Okay , and then we have the 2 and 8 is 10.Put your 0 , carry your 1 , and 1 plus 1 plus 6 is 8.It 's 804 . That 's without the carry over.Well , let 's finish this lecture by doing the carry over here.Okay , here we go Charlie , pay attention.6 times 4 is 24.Put the 4 , carry the 2.6 times 3 is 18 , right ? Add the 2 , is 20 , put your 0 down , carry the 2 , and 6 times 1 is 6 plus 2 is 804.So there you go.That 's the vertical format.But these vertical formats are using the distributive property , so there you go.That 's your introduction to the distributive property.So , we 're going to work on multiplication more , in the future , anyway , keep up with your homework and we 'll see you all again soon .
