this month we 're going to be looking atthis topic actually it 's I think a monthto the day that your first a p20 will bethe 2nd of September I believe whichmaybe you 're like what already thisthing 's been sitting up here and here weare right now is the second the actualqueue it 's not something firstbut anyway your job timetable is I thinkyou actually so it 's coming so thiswhole month we 're gon na be looking atDonna its Nats sort of the youstudy or driving we 're going to gothrough all of these ideas together socarefully you 'll get the conditions socollecting data displaying it interpretdata and then lastly the prelim courseanyhow summarizing data now just like wedid with the driving focus that I justsort of boil it down into some simplerlanguage so collecting data first yourto get the datasecondly once you 've got that data youwant to be able to show it and you alsowant to be able to read it if so whatelse is showing you Donna right sothat 's a display and integrity meansshow it in some form in there are lotsand lots of different forms and be ableto read it interpret as well know whatit meansfirst lastly summarize the data so oneof the tricky things about data isthere 's so much in that you want todistill it down because otherwise it'sjust incomprehensible it 's like you knowI was just thinking last night aboutlike what why is it important that welook at this I 've alluded to the factthat up to unity such a what since theydo n't learn any of this which is crazygood morning which is why actually inthe new services that they 're discussingto launch in two years our bear putdinosaur sistex into tuna and extensionbecause they 've realized that just likewe give it to you everyone really needsto learn stuff I thought a three bigreasons why this is like really reallyuseful number one this happens to me Icould n't ask event I mean it 's have tosee your senses you we 've alluded thatbefore so I think it 's actually yeahit 's a week we 're a week out fromactually probably your parents will getopen up the big four but Everest do atthe same time on Tuesday oh is it reallyyeah teach us to talk about that so wellI do n't know if you 're gon na be therewhen your parents figure out thequestion the last time I did it it was avery it 's a fairly long process is a lotof questions answer so number one it'stimely number two no matter what kind ofjob you have in the future like all ofthe types of work you 'll be doing willbe involved with data in some way likeyou 've got to understand times and moneyand people and all of the ways to sortof tied it up in an ethos that 's is theway we do that lastly I just wanted toshow you even if your word does itinvolve Donna in a big way you areconstantly being presented with Donnaand so you need to be able to understandlike how these like what all of thesethings mean so if I pull out things likethis so a few table so these are twographs that represent the same Talentokay we 're actually going to look at aspecific some point under I think it'sundies to talk about misleading graphsnow both of these represent the sameDonna knew carefully what 's thedifference between them it 's the scaleright now the fancy word for this thefancy phrase which I 'll explain what weget to it it 's called a truncated y-axisokay so have a look at these numbersright this starts from 0 that'sgenerally we expect the bottom of thegraph to be and then you go up okay butgraphs frequently do n't start from 0they start from some number whichwhoever is giving you the data wants tochoose to make this like convenient toconvey oh my goodness look at theinterest rates but actually the changesare quite wide you this happens all thetime and sports that 's a really bad thisactually because they just want to showyou something and make it look justthinking like oh wow gee that guy 's notdo it so well Missy or three so thepresented can be hugely deceptive righthere 's another one this is like acompany right and this picture looksgood rightcompanies do it okay except again I'mgoing to show you the same data butpresented slightly differently this isthe same company and the same numbersbut maybe you 're like wait how could onebe going up and wo n't be going down Iwish you look carefully and I want youto come back to this one to see what'sthe difference okay so one wordcumulative for right so this presentsokay over time Hathi so if I addeverything upso this graph it has to go up at leastyou 'd hope right so over time it'sincreasing but it kind of masks the factthat actually over time the company isdo we poorer and poorer losing marketshare or whatever it is okay so againsay Donna presented differently um he'sit takes a second to work out what'sgoing on here right this kind of looksgood it looks like a gun deaths aredecreasing right except they 're not whynot the graph is upside down zeros onthe top zeros at the top so effect thelower this graph goes the more gundeaths there are and you kind of look atthe way they 've tried to try like say ohyeah this is the red mark it 's sneakyright yeah exactlythis is why it 's not like twins quit butit 's sort of was popularized by herethat there are lies damned lies andstatistics is try and you know pull thewool over your eyesnow I 've got a couple okay so waitpresented with data that is what we callit correlated right so two sets of dataand they seem to be connected in someway so this is actually a very famousexample so it 's like thanks a lotNicholas Cage I blame you for all of thedeaths by people performing in touchbut that seat said there is acorrelation loosely but there 's nocausation right it 's not like one causesthe otheror because cage is like what 's a bitwere drowning your pools I should reallymake some more films this year this isnot a connection like that at all rightso things like that this is a prettyimportant why do n't you drive two thingsto you here right climate changeyeah there 's this incredible culture ofclimate change deniers and they 'll lookat a graph like this and say okay nowthere are two significant problems withthis number one the way I give it asbeing drawn that there is really no morewarming is this red line does anyoneknow what the red lines called it 's gota special name probably easy especiallyit 's called a threatened alliance soit 's like we 've got lots of them as theygoing up and down and up and down butlike what 's the overall trend okay solooks like yeah things are going downexcept for the fact that this isactually not a trend line at allhow have they made this line lookcarefully you can tell me how theywere n't that where it goes okay oh yeahlook it 's clearly it 's cold right oh allthey have done and it 's yeah it shouldbe a line of best fit but it 's notbecause they 've just joined the startpoint to the end point just yeah that'sall they 've done right now it justimagined how do I came at this this yearover here if I had started at 99 ratherthan 98 the line they would have drawnwould be quite different right it wouldhave gone from here upwards actually thetrend line or the wider best people onthis should be going up despite the factthat it starts at a particularly highervalue okayyeah that 's so there 's the other problemyeah I 'm not sure if this is gon na be PCthat good morninglet me try this yeah there we gois that better you can see that okay sothis shows you from going further backlike now you know 298 is just aroundhere right that 's the data they werelooking at but when you look at a longertrend it 's like oh yeah this is this islooking a little worse and I could gofurther back as well and people aregoing to argue back and forth okay nowthe last one I say the last word to thebest one to last you can just go to theDonald J Trump approach and tweets upyou like it yeah just how about look atit just have a look at that first dayyou know okay it 's not immediatelyobvious what the problem is there'smaybe like this one which is kind oflike huh what 's going on for starterswhat is this list of percentages for onething it clearly does n't have 200percent right so there 's overlappingnumbers that are kind of been compoundedhere okay so you 're like what what isthis list supposed to represent but youstart to see as you read the words morecarefully you 're like oh this blacks andthen this whites and then thesecategories that clearly overlap likejust because they 're police that doesn'tmean they 're not white like what doesthat mean okay so it 's just confusingand then more interestingly there 's thispicked on the bottom which obviously I'mnot expecting you today but it says thesources from the crime statistics bureauin San Francisco the tiny littlefollowing that is there is the crimestatistics bureau one of the issues withthis is that no one knows exactly wherethis divers come but no one 's been ableto cooperate it so it 's almost like it'sjust been playing made up I ca n't knowobviously you look at this you scrollingthrough on your feet and of courseyou 're not going to go inside or onebetterfact check this one right so thereforestatistics this is something which isjust going to be in your life and youneed to gookay which is why I think it 's so coolso the very first item and you can makea new sub head if you have already thevery first I will look at the ds1 ifyou 've got to collect Donald well thefirst thing you would do is work outwell how are we going to do this okay sothe subheading is survey design thereare gon na be three kinds of I'mquestions of weight issues that we needto be aware of if this first one I'mgonna get you there um in pairs orwhatever I just kind of brace on a fewyou guys have filled out surveys beforeloads and loads and loads of themor arcs and surveyed I like it to thepeople around you and answer thisquestion for me just brace up a littlebit what kinds of questions can you askor or maybe you know what kinds ofquestions have you been asked if this isall kinds right there 's lots ofdifferent types of questions that willgive you different kinds of data sothink about all the surveys you 've everanswer if you get a questions you'vebeen asked it all the sameokay so let me give you a tip amultiple-choice question is different toa question where you have to likeprovide a kind of response rather thanselect so there you go that 's two broadcategories I 've already h2 you can Igive you two three minutes to talk tothe people around you well I have a sipof this lovely looking hot chocolate andthere wo n't come together
