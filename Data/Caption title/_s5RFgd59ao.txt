MATT PARKER : Today I 'm gon na show you a ... amazing number , and some of you may have come across this before . It 's an absolute classic , but I still think there 's a lot to be said about the number 9609393 ... ... four , nine -- this is where it gets quite interesting actually , 'cause it goes nine , eight , two ... ... three , eight , zero , nine , six , -- you 'll notice , actually , this is one of the more boring parts of the number -- seven , six , zero ... Every time I mess this bit up , hang on , that ... that bit should n't be there ; I put that in by accident . Sorry . Where was I ? ... forty-seven , one , nine ! And there it is ; that 's the number I 'm going to talk about today . I still find this number absolutely fascinating , and the reason this number is so great is because it relates to a fantastic inequality . A formula if you will , which I will put underneath here . So , the formula we 're gon na look at is : Â½ less than the floor function of the mod function of the floor function of the y-coordinate on 17 , â€ ” floor functionâ€ ” times 2 to the power of negative 17 times the floor function of x subtract the mod of the floor function of y again . Oop , that 's floor , sorry . And that is mod 17 , so I close that mod there and then this whole thing , once you 've got that , you then -- that open mod is 2 ; close that , and then close the floor function . OK , so now we have ridiculous number and we have ridiculous equation . To show you how the two are linked , I thought I would show you the plot of this inequality , because what they 're saying is : if you have an x , y axis and you putâ€ ” for each point on that planeâ€ ” you put in the x- and y-coordinates into this formula , it would tell you whether or not you should colour in that point . So , in fact , this tells you which part of an x , y plot should have a dot , and which should n't . And I 've got a printout I have done of that formula , and , so , if you plot that formula , you get this plot here . So , this is the plot of that formula , and , in case you 're wondering what is particularly astounding about this , the formula , when you plot it , is itself . It is its own form -- The formula is its own plot . The plot is the formula . This is called Tupper 's self-referential formula , and when you plot it , you get itself , and that , for me , is one of the freakiest , most bizarre parts of mathematics . A formula which is its own plot . Okay , there is , however , one slight cheat it does -- it actually does that ; if you plot this formula , you get itself as its plot , but the cheat is this ' k ' down here , because I have n't actually specified where we are on the vertical y-axis . You can see on the x-axis we 're zero to 106 ; fairly normal territory . But here we 're like `` ' k ' , what on earth is that ? '' That k value is this number here . Basically , we are a long way up the y-axis right now . If you go a huge distance up the y-axis of this plot , and you ignore everything else below it , and there 's more after it ; ignore everything above it . At this one particular zone between this number and this number plus 17 , is where you get the equation that we were using to plot them . What 's actually amazing about Tupper 's self-referential formula is not that it plots itself â€ ” it 's that it plots everything . As you go up the y-axis , it plots every single 106x17 grid of white and black pixels . So , anything that fits in that grid is somewhere on this plot . So , not only is Tupper 's formula in the plot , but also every other formula you can fit into that size . In fact , I found a different value of k which is where it 's the same formula , but smiley faces instead of the word 'mod ' . And so , that 's a slightly different value of k , gives you the smiley-face version of this formula . Also found the point where Pac-Man is eating the formula , as chased by a ghost . And so , that one is ... I think that one 's gon na be higher up as well It 's ... yes . It 's not far off , though . And so , anything you can possibly fit into one of these appears in there somewhere . And I can actually show you how you can get from any picture you want to that number . The way it actually works is you take the pixelated form of your equation , so let 's get our original one . Let 's do ... Where 's the proper one ? None of these ridiculous ones . Okay , here were go , right . So there 's ... there 's the original one . And what you do is you start in the bottom left-hand corner , and if you want that to be a black pixel , you put a 1 . And then you go to the one above it . And that 's black as well , so you put another 1 . And the one above that is white , so you put a 0 . The one above that is white ; 0 . 1 . 0 . 1 . 0 . 1 . 0 . 0 . Is that two or three ? Looks like three . 0 . 1 . 0 . And then you carry on . And you scroll up the first column , and then up the second column , and up the next one . And you write it off as a binary number . And you end up , at the very end , with a very long binary number . You then put that into base 10 . You multiply it by 17 , and that gives you the k value for where that plot appears on the graph . In fact , this is a bitmap function . And what Jeff Tupper was doing was looking at using equations and being able to plot them automatically using software , he 's a computer scientist at the University of Toronto . And this is a kind of a side-effect , it 's an interesting outcome of the legitimate proper research he was doing . In fact , Brady , I got you a present . I took the Numberphile logo , pixelated it , turned it into a binary number . Multiplied it by 17 . Put it into base 10 . And there it is down there . So that is the k coordinate , of the Numberphile logo , on Tupper 's plot . Okay , so , when I wrote my book , Things To Make and Do in the Fourth Dimension Brady : Woah , woah you happen to have it on you ? Matt : I happen to have it with me at all times as you know Brady . I wanted to put in Tupper 's self-referential formula , and so in the book , ah here it is . In the chapter on functions I put in a picture of it , and I 'm all like `` oh wow that 's amazing '' and then later on in the book when I get to digital images , because it is just a bitmap ( where is it , there we are ) here we go I 've got it again and I explain the system . So there 's the actual plot , there 's if you turn it into 0s and 1s And there 's when you multiply it by 17 . Except , that 's not actually the correct number . So the plot 's correct , the binary number 's correct but this is not , because I thought it would be hilarious to put in a different number . And so if anyone ever does take that number -- and I 've never told anyone , Penguin do n't know this , FSG who published it in the US do n't know this . I 've not revealed it to anyone -- this is the first public release of this information . If you reverse that number you get a different plot , I have defaced the plot for that number . This is the world 's slowest , longest running troll you 'll ever come across . So hopefully , you know , years from now someone may finally get around to doing it . And they will not be faced with that plot . test
