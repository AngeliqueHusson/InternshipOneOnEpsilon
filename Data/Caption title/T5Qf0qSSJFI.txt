hi rob welcome math antic sin lesson going learn basic number system going learn important concept cal led place value number system use math cal led base ten different symbol counting math could use system based different number like base base give ten guess es number ten popular choice ten symbol use cal led look like zero one two three four five six seven eight first glance might think nine remember zero count one also see system represent pretend apple orchard full apple tree sand tree loaded big juicy red need pick count going use something cal led number place count best way understand number place imagine like small box big enough hold one digit time count change digit number place match many apple picked example start apple put digit number place zero mean none apple start coming orchard begin two three four five six seven eight got nine apple also got problem already run count highest digit lot apple left count solution use group help us count pick one apple ten right let combine ten apple single many apple many group ten apple one help us lack problem sure use another number place instead new number place count individual time like first number place going use count apple ten word use keep track many group ten apple picked example picked one group ten put digit number place picked two group ten put digit number place picked three group ten put digit number place see happening new number place used count group us reuse original ten time able count represent bigger new number place counting group ten going name place name original number place place used count thing one time really important going use new number place instead old going use along side old one one number place counting one sand another number place counting two number place together let us represent amount group ten example already picked thirty apple place three group ten place individual apple left picked thirty two apple place place represent two individual apple group ten fact ten two number place count way zero ninety nine number place axed highest able count higher unless get another number place picked ninety nine apple pick one exactly one hundred apple sand make group one hundred use new number place count many group one hundred picked mean reuse ten new number place count many group one hundred cal led hundred place use count group hundred starting see base number system different number place represent different sized group use count number place tell us many group digit place tell us many digit place tell us many group ten digit hundred place tell us many group one hundred time got new number place count left previous number important number place always exact order starting place move left number place represent amount sand also new number place represent group exactly ten times bigger previous number ten times bigger one one hundred ten times bigger really important help us see pattern bigger number place sit help us see next number place count group ten times one hundred cal led thousand place next number place count group ten times bigger place number place keep going like next millions billion may notice get lot number place next like little hard quickly recognize place many use kind separator every three place make easier keep track example us use comma every three number place make easier identify thing like thousand place millions place seeing number place together help understand mean place value number number place digit value even though ten digit stand different amount depending place digit place mean five place mean fifty hundred place mean bigger number place sa place mean billion place mean digit place effects value course work math time number place invisible underlying pattern always oh number place invisible certain need use make clear number talking see mean imagine hundred place represent make number place invisible look like five make sure people know mean five hundred need hundred place place place tell hundred place mean great way see place value action actual expand show really combination different cal led writing number expanded form example expand hundred place mean place mean twenty place mean four expanded form combination plus twenty plus four let try writing another number expanded form expand thousand place plus seven hundred hundred place plus ten place five place expanded form six thousand plus seven hundred plus ten plus see base number system works number place used count different sized group ten times bigger next number place tell us many group tricky part number place invisible know work behind scene order make sense number show like exercise section help practice get used place value works super important want successful math always
