formula area triangle equal b times h equal area b equal length base h equal length height area equal times length base times length height solve formula height visualize little bit let draw triangle draw triangle know b h would length distance right band distance right height height triangle let lower case h wrote formula want us solve formula height formula area equal base times height want solve h essentially want isolate one side equation already right hand let get rid everything else right hand well ill one step time could kind skip step wan ted let see get rid best way get rid thats h multiply sides equation reciprocal multiply sides equation let let multiply remember anything one side equation also side equation whole point behind multiplying times right hand side equation going b hand left hand side equation almost b multiplying want isolate h could divide sides equation b dividing sides almost view b coefficient h dividing sides band get well right hand side b cancel left hand side left b get h swapping sides equal band solve formula height guess could useful someone gave bunch area sand bunch base length said keep giving height triangle rearrange formula isolate specific variable linear equation algebra khan academy
