scatter plots and line fittingspreadsheets can be really handy fordrawing graphs however if you do n't knowwhat you 're doingthe graph can be cluttered incorrect orjust plain silly sometimes we want tolook at the relationship between twovariables and a set of dataexamples are sales of chocolate in dailytemperature sales of ice cream and dailytemperature distance from University andamount of time spent online a graph canhelp to show how a change in onevariable relates to a change in anothervariable here is an example helen sellschoconutties she is noticed that sheseems to sell more choconutties on colddays than she does when the weather iswarm this is interesting to hear and shedecides to see if there is a patternshe 's looking to see if there is arelationship between temperature andsales each weekday for the next sixweeks she keeps track of the temperatureand degrees Celsius and the number ofpackets of choconutties she sells thisgives her 30 observations correspondingto the 30 weekdays for each day she hastwo values the temperature and thenumber of packets of choconutties soldshe records the data in a spreadsheetand gives it to her brother to make agraph it looks like this Helen does notfind that very helpful so she asked usfor helpfirst we wish to make a graph and thenwe want to fit a line to it at the endit should look like this drawing ascatterplot in Excel first highlight thetwo columns of data including the titlesand click on the insert tab theleft-hand column should be the one thatis going on the horizontal axis or theindependent variable then select scatterin the charts section select scatterwith only markers the top left-handoption is we do not want the pointsjoined up we do not select line graphthe graph should now appear as an objectin the worksheet beside the data thisgraph needs a better title in someexcess labelsin chart layouts so that layout onewhich adds a nexus titles to change thetitle click on it then enter the titleyou want in the formula bar do the samefor the exes titles then delete thelegend by clicking on it then deletingnow we wish to fit a line to the data inthe graph Excel calls us a trendlineclick somewhere in the space around thegraph to make sure the chart tools arevisible select the Layout tab from theanalysis group click on trendline andmore trendline options select linear andcheck display equation on chart anddisplay r-squared value on chart closethe dialog boxvoila an equation appears move theequation to a better position on thegraph so that we can see it and there wehave fitted a straight line to the dataas Helen requested we still need toexplain what it means in the equation oftwo numbers negative two point threeeight nine for which we will round tonegative two point four in one hundredand twelve point two for which we willround to one hundred and twelve pointtwo negative two point four is the slopeof the line we can tell this because itis the value that the X or independentvariable is multiplied by one hundredand twelve point two is the interceptthe slope value negative two point fouralso known as the coefficient of X tellsus that for each extra degree oftemperature the daily sales decreased bytwo point four packets of choconuttieson average we say it is decreasedbecause it has a negative slope if ithad had a positive slope then the dailysales would have increased two pointfour for each extra degree oftemperature the positive relationshipmight be more likely for something thatpeople like to eat on hot days like icecreams the intercept tells us how manypackets Helen would sell if thetemperature was zero degrees howeverthis is outside the range oftemperatures in the data the interceptis unlikely to be of any usefulinterpretation this is often the casewith intercept values in fitted datathe other value we found was ther-squared also known as the coefficientof determination it tells us how much ofthe variation in the dependent variablein this case sales can be explained bythe independent variable in this casetemperature we can say that temperatureexplains 17 % of the variation in packetssoldHelen 's original idea was that she sellsmore packets of chocolate ease on colddays this graph and this equation seemedto support this theory we can onlycomment on the slope with regard to thedata on which the line was fitted to usethe data to make generalizations aboutall days of sales we would need to useinferential statisticsto find out how we can make use of thesample data to make generalizationsabout the population watch the videoregression in Excel Scatterplots in Excel, Regression part 1 - Statistics Help Scatterplots in Excel, Regression part 1 - Statistics Help Scatterplots in Excel, Regression part 1 - Statistics Help
