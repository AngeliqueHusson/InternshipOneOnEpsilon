today we look at the surface area andthe volume of a sphere this is how wecan draw a sphere the dotted portion iswhat can not be seen from the front viewand this is the center of the sphere andlet R be its radius do n't forget everypoint on the sphere is equidistant fromits center how do we define the surfacearea of the sphere the surface area ofthe sphere equals to 4 PI R squareda sphere has just one type of surfacearea its total surface area is itscurved surface area as it does not haveany flat surfaces and the volume of thesphere is given as 4 by 3 PI R cubed atthe momentwe do not need to know how we arrivedhere the formulae but we will cover thistopic for sure in one of our videos ofhigher grade mathematics if we know theformula for a sphere we can easilyderive the formulae for a hemisphere 2and what is a hemisphere a hemisphere ishalf a sphere let 's say it has a radiusR we have just got the spherehorizontally and we are looking at thebottom part the best way to understandthe hemisphere is by looking at theearth the equator divides the earth intotwo hemispheres the Northern Hemisphereand the southern hemisphere if we splitthe earth at the equator we get twohemispheres like these ok great let'sget back to a figure now what do younotice looking at the hemisphere thefirst thing you should notice is that ithas a flat surfaceand a curved surface this tells us thatunlike the sphere the hemisphere willhave a different curved surface area andtotal surface area let 's look at thecurved surface area first looking atboth the figures we can easily say thatit will be half that of the surface areaof the spheredividing this by two we get two PI Rsquare that 's the curved surface areawhat about the total surface area thetotal surface area will be the sum ofthe area of the curved surface and thearea of the circle on top we havefigured the area of the curved surfaceto be 2 PI R squared the area of thecircle on top will be PI R squaredadding these two we get 3 PI R squaredso the curved surface area is 2 PI Rsquared and the total surface area is 3PI R squared what about its volume againthe volume of the hemisphere will beexactly half that of the volume of thesphere dividing this by 2 we get 2 by 3PI R cubedyou Volume and Surface Area of Spheres ( GMAT / GRE / CAT / Bank PO / SSC CGL) Volume and Surface Area of Spheres ( GMAT / GRE / CAT / Bank PO / SSC CGL) Volume and Surface Area of Spheres ( GMAT / GRE / CAT / Bank PO / SSC CGL)
