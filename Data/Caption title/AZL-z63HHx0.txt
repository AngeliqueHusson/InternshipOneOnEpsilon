g'day and welcome to the tech mathChannel we 're going to have a look at inthis video is a way of multiplying anytypes of polynomials together butespecially really really big ones andare more difficult sorts of ones so thisis the fourth video I 've made we'relooking at the multiplying these typesof algebraic expressions so I 'll putsome links up to the earlier onesthey 're probably really worth seeing ifyou have n't seen them yet but I so we'regoing to be multiplying some reallyreally big polynomials in this one soI 'll give you an example here to getfairly rapid answers without doing hugeamounts of our writing and equals andequals and equals and equals so the twopolynomials I 'm going to get youmultiplying together are as follows 2xcubed and x squared plus 3x plus 4 andwe 're going to multiply this by 4x cubedplus 2x squared plus 2xplus three okay and UNICEF set this uplike a fairly standard mathematicalcalculation but there is a fair degreeof difference between this and astandard multiplication now to help usto visualize what we 're at do I 'm gonnaput a bunch of dots up here just torepresent each one of these so this okayso that we got four and four partpolynomial expression here so there'sfour dots here to represent that andwe 've got a four powder here those fourdots the monitors represent that okay sobut for it to get this first part of ouranswer what we 're going to do is we'regoing to multiply these guys togetherhere okay this will give us this part ofour answer here so four threes at 12okay positive 12 okay the next part ofair inside to get this we 're going tomultiply this one in this one and thisone in this one okay so 3 times 3x + 4times 2x we 're going to add thesetogether so 3 times 3x which is 9 x + 4times 2x which is 8x we add thesetogether 9x + 8 X is 17 Xokay to get the next part of our answeryou 're going to see this patternhopefully you 'll see this pattern it 's apretty easy one to pick up we 're goingto multiply this one this one this onethis one and this one and this one andwe 're going to add our answers togetherthis is going to give us the x squaredpart of our answer okay so 3 times X is3x 3 times x squared is 3x squared 3xtimes 2x is 6x squared and 4 times 2xsquared is 8x squared so I 'm going toadd these together so that 3 plus 6 plus8 so 3 plus 6 plus 8 is 17 x squaredokay that 's a positive that one earlierto actually be putting the positivethere as we 're going along apologize forthat so the next part of our answer isgoing to be the X cubed part of ouranswer okay so we 're going to bemultiplying this one now by this onewe 're going to be multiplying this oneby this one this one by this one andthis one by this one okay you see ispattern here okay so this will give usour X cubed part of our answerokay so I 'll even put that X cubed therenow so 3 times 2x cubed is 6x cubed 2xtimes x squared is 2x cubed 2x by 2xsquared times 3x is 6x cubed and 4xcubed by 4 is 16 X cube sidethere 's a X cube so we have six plussorry six plus two which is eight plussix which is 14 plus 16 which is thirtyokay so that 's 30 X cubedokay we 'll go to the next part of ouranswer now right now this bit we'removing now across so we 're going to benow multiplying this one in this onethis one on this one and this one andthis one so let 's see how we go here sofirst off what we have is this is goingto be by the way that 's a positive ourlast one this is going to be our X tothe power of 4 answer okayso 2x times 2x cubed is 4x the four tothe 4x to the power of 4 these two xtogether are going to be 2x to the powerof 4 and these guys multiplied togetherare going to be 12x to the power of 4 so4 plus 2 which is 6 plus 12 is 18 okaydoing pretty well I almost done the nextthing we 're going to get in and that 's apositive I 'll put that in there it 's apositive the next so we 're going to doare these two okay so this is going togive us our X to the power of fiveanswer okay so 2 times 2 is 4 4 times 1is 4 so 4 plus 4 is I and the next onewe 're going to get finally is our lastpart of our answer is we 're going to bemultiplying these two guys together isgoing to give us our X to the power of 6answer it 's a positive so X to the powerof 6 okay 2 times 4 is that there 's ouranswerthat 's pretty cool right I mean that'sone huge polynomial expression beingsolved and that that is the correct butlet 's let 's check to see this is correctokay so to do this we 're going tosubstitute in one into an X ok here sowhat we 're going to do is 2 plus 1 plus3 plus 4 so 2 plus 1 is 3 plus 3 is 6plus 4 is 10 4 plus 2 is 6 plus 2 is 8plus 3 is a level you have to multiplythese together we get 110 ok and then westart adding these guys up together okaythis the coefficients here so 8 plus 8is 16 plus 1834 plus 30 is 64 plus 70 17 I apologizeis 81 plus another 17 is 90 paint plus12 is 110 so our answer is correct okaywow it 's pretty uh that 's pretty biganswer there so hopefully you got theidea of this so we went just just torecap on that one we 're going to to getthese the way you do this is you firstmultiply these two expressions to getthis part of the answer these two to getthis part these two at these three nowto get this one these guys here to getthis one these guys here to get this onethese guys here to get this and thenthis to get this okay so it 's a fairlyyou standard sort of thing okay hards ifit 's a great little method thoughbecause this otherwise would take you along long time to work out so what aboutwe try one more one that 's slightlydifferent and trying to keep those upthere that that particular diagramthough because I think it 's quite handyjust to express what 's going on here sowhat about I do a bit of a different onesay I was to do 4xcubed plus 2x squaredplus three X plus four and what I'mgoing to do is I 'm going to multiplythis by 5x cubedplus 4x and I 'm just going to multiplythese guys together okay now what youmight realize straight away is we have abit of an issue here we have a few gapswe do n't have any x squared value herewe do n't have a a units value here sothere 's a bit of a trick for doing theseso we 're going to get this 4x we'regoing to move it okay so keep that 4x inline we have I 'm going to move it overhere so it lines up so it lines up withour X a so for X lines up here and forthese other ones we have known x squaredvalue so I 'm just going to put a zerotherewe have no units value I 'm just going toput a zero there okay and we can startnow doing what we were doing before okayso we multiply these guys to get ourunits multiply these guys together weactually get no result because nothingtimes four is nothing okay so we do thenext part we 're going to end up with Xanswers which is going to besomeone actually get rid of the zero andI think we need to leave it there sowe 're going to end up to get it EXOvalue we 're going to go three x timesnothing which is nothing in 4x times 4which is 16 X so our answer there is 16X to get our next part which is our xsquared part we 're going to multiplythese three guys okay so the 0 times 2 xsquared is nothing and 0 times 4 isnothing so our early part that actuallymatters is 3x times 4x which is 12xsquared okay that 's a positive 2 now getthis next part we 're going to multipliedthese ones like this okayso what we 're going to do now is nothingtimes 4x is nothing4x times 2x squared is 8 to the X to thepower 3 this one 's going to give usnothing and this one 's going to give us20 X to the power 3 so 20 plus 8 is 28 Xto the power of 3 positive let 's now gothe next one which is where we 're goingto be multiplying this and this this andthis this and this so let 's do that 4 by4 because this is going to be our X 4 wedo n't even need to we can just keep ourkeep it you know not in worry aboutsaying X 14 just go 4 by 4 is 16 2 isnothing and 3 is 15 so 16 plus 15 is 31positive then we go to then this nextone which is going to be our X 5 value 4we 're going to be multiplying these guysso 4 times nothing is nothing2 times 5 is 10 and then we 're going tofinally get our last answer multiplyingthese guys which has our X to the 6value 4 times 5 is 20 okay and that'sour answerhey it 's a pretty big answer let 's checkout pretty big answer so we can go putthat value of 1 into this so we 're goingto end up with 4 plus 2 Plus 3 plus 4 so4 plus 2 is 6 plus 3 is 9 plus 4 is 13 5plus 4 is 9 we multiply these together13 times 9 is 117 so 20 plus 10 is 30plus 31 is 61plus 28 is 89 plus 12 is 101 plus 16 is117 so our answer is correct okay sohopefully you like these the next videois we 're going to be having a look at iswe 're going to be having a look at howto divide polynomials okay so this videowill be up fairly soon or maybe whenyou 're watching it up already okay so Ihope to see you next time see you thenbye test
