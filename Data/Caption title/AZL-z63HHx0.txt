g day welcome tech math channel going look video way multiplying polynomial together especially really really big difficult sort fourth video made looking multiplying algebraic expression ill put links ear lier probably really worth seeing havent seen yet going multiplying really really big polynomial one give example get fairly rapid answer without writing equal equal equal going get multiplying together follow x squared plus plus going multiply squared plus three unice f set like fairly standard mathematical calculation fair degree difference standard multiplication help visualize bunch dot one got four four part polynomial expression theres four dot represent weve got four powder monitor represent get first part answer going going multiply guy together give us part answer four three positive next part inside get going multiply one one one one times going add together times x add together x get next part going see pattern hopefully see pattern pretty easy one pick going multiply one one one one one one going add answer together going give us x squared part answer times x times x squared squared squared times squared going together plus plus plus x thats positive one actually positive going along apologize next part answer going x cube part answer going multiplying one one going multiplying one one one one one one see pattern give x cube part ill even put x cube times cube cube x squared cube times cube x cube side theres x cube six plus sorry six plus two eight plus six plus thats x well go next part answer right bit across going multiplying one one one one one one let see go first going way thats positive last one going x power answer times cube four power two x together going power guy together going power plus plus pretty well almost done next thing going get thats positive ill put positive next going two going us x power five answer times times plus next one going get finally last part answer going multiplying two guy together going give us x power positive x power times theres pretty cool right mean thats one huge polynomial expression correct let check see going substitute one x k going plus plus plus plus plus plus level multiply together get k guy together coefficient plus plus plus plus apologize plus another paint answer correct pretty u h thats pretty big answer hopefully got idea went one going get way first multiply two expression get part answer two get part two three get one guy get one guy get one guy get get fairly standard sort thing hard great little method though otherwise would take along long time work try one one thats slightly different trying keep particular diagram though think quite handy express whats going bit different one say plus squared plus three x plus four going multiply going multiply guy together might realize straight away bit issue dont x squared value dont value theres bit trick going get going move keep line going move x x known x squared value going put value going zero start multiply guy get multiply guy together actually get result nothing times four nothing next part going end going someone actually get rid zero think need leave going end get going go three x times nothing nothing times x answer get next part x squared part going multiply three guy times x squared nothing times nothing early part times thats positive get next part going like going nothing times times squared x power going give us nothing going give x power plus x power positive let next one going multiplying let going x dont even need keep keep know worry saying x go nothing plus go next one going x value going multiplying times nothing times going finally get last answer multiplying guy x times answer hey pretty big answer let check pretty big answer go value going end plus plus plus plus plus plus multiply times plus plus plus answer correct hopefully like next video going look going look divide polynomial video fairly soon maybe watching already hope see next time
