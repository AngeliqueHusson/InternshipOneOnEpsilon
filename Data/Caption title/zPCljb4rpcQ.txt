feel like siphon ing gas every car van trunk gas station neighborhood setting math textbook fire wonderful help avoid life prison watching video fort r wit hello ladies r wit wood tutor ing tutorial going finding area sector alright circle check check check area sector ladies gentle men diagram help us radius know thats center circle point circle green area going sector area sector trying find green shaded area given fact angle theta given radian l alright normally given arc length right length point circle way point circle finding video area within region slice pie actual pie slice area trying find got couple formula well tutorial one going area found taking half radius squared times theta long theta radian know radian degree symbol know right see degree symbol degree dont see degree symbol degree radian give degree know degree see symbol give central angle degree use formula central angle degree divided times pir squared aka area circle right taking area circle degree stick formula right actually convert degree check linker right order right let check problem problem number one ked find area sector given radius three theta angle measurement radian know dont degree symbol therefore theta angle measurement radian going ill simplified formula one use angle measurement go ahead fill starting ill one half times radius thats going squared times theta case going pi right going initial setup ladies going simplify order operation ill say times times like nine cancel right also simplify goes goes twice multiplying everything answer going tobe pi squared right thats going answer remember dealing area unit measurement always going second power right thats answer yeah ask exact answer meaning dont actually calculate value nearest thousandth place gon na box around answer like answer written decimal notation mean grab bing calculator gon na pull calculator right trusty fort calculator case right show look like plug result see gone ahead plugged value calculator press enter gon na give result thousandth rounding nearest thousandth place result done done ladies right tokay answer rounded nearest thousand place going six thousand right let box well gift wrapping done done number one let move next one proper assess find area sector time radius going fee theta degree thats second form case central angle degree divided times pir squared let plug thing degree measurement going times pi radius thats going squared could go ahead simplify order looking forty five pi times squared going tobe alright far going forward going simplify knowing going goes times could reduce goes twice goes five times us result pi squared right thats going answer exact answer need answer decimal notation go ahead plug calculator hit enter right pi hundredth thats rounded thousand place right let go ahead write end thats gon na right like let box answer red box like result either exact answer rounded place right thats problem number two let move next one prod number three say find area sector radius theta radian pi first form theta radian sour angle measurement radian use one right go ahead plug thing end times radius squared times theta pi gon na use order operation much possible good give times times pi right know simplify multiply prefer gon na end saying times yeah well say goes ill go times multiply straight across end pi centimeter squared yeah like gon na exact answer problem number need find decimal notation go ahead plugged calculator go ahead route nearest unless otherwise directed textbook teacher amen amen gon na buck boxing like ladies done moving problem number turn page problem number area sector given radius fee theta degree well formula x divided times pi r squared value know x degree thats gon na times pi times radius squared radius tokay thats right understand ugly oh yeah thats thats atrocious let fix cant live gon na thats much better fly dont order operation pi right result squared going simplify well well say goes goes three times well go ahead multiply straight across end pi measurement ladies another ugly gon na keep special right well go ahead box ladies gentle men theres result exact pi third square fee need decimal notation go ahead throw calculator press enter thats probably let move along prime given area sector case area equal pi radius inch es theyre us find theta theta well first formula given radius squared times theta theta radian sin formula right let ideal situation well plug value isolate theta order solve look like area equivalent pi equal squared times theta order operation swell pi equal one half times theta take half right ill pi equal theta herein order solve theta divide sides right know theta equivalent pi radian go thats answer ladies case working backwards trying solve case solve ended pi exact answer right want decimal notation go ahead plug pi calculator round place whatever textbook teacher say make happy right next problem last problem video ahead hand mascot kappa math muggy problem today final area sector radius gon na v theta pi area equivalent radius squared times theta formula right theta radian go ahead plug value iso know times radius gon na squared times r theta gon na pi going use order order simplify end times times pi going simplify know goes eight times go gon na effort every equal sign gon na fix multiplying straight across youl lend pi gon na screen thats right thats answer hopefully help always oh got back go ahead box go always please rate comment subscribe able please donate bring free math tutorial kappa r wit foot
