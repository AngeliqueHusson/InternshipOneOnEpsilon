all right what we 're going to be doingtoday is looking at how to factor apolynomial with four terms now ideallyyou 're going to want to attempt factorby grouping first because that 's theeasiest procedure for doing thatall right however factor by groupingdoes not always work all right so whenit does n't you have to have a back-upplanall right my suggestion would be to usethe rational root theorem and allow thatto make the factoring a lot easier foryou if you use the rational root theoremyou can use it to generate a list ofpossible roots and then you can applysome synthetic division all right that'sgoing to break it down hopefully into atrinomial and then you 're going to beable to continue to factor from thereokay here we have a polynomialexpression with four terms as you mightattempt to factor by grouping to beginwith you can see that an x squared wouldcome out of these terms a two would comeout of these terms and I will not getmatching inside terms there so factor bygrouping is not going to work all rightin which case I am going to apply therational root theoremokay the rational root theorem says thatif we take this ending constant and welet that be P and we take the leadinginteger coefficient which in this caseis a 1 and we let that be our Q then weshould be able to generate all of ourpossible roots with the equation xequals plus or minus P over Q all rightnow for the ones that we do we 're goingto stick with a Q of 1 because once youstart adding you know this you know maybe a coefficient of 2 or 3 or 4 thenumber of possible roots goes up veryvery quickly and makes the problem veryvery difficultalright so P over Q is going to give usall the factors for over all the factorsof 1 over 1 is not going to have abearing on this at all so I just need tolook at my factors of my 4 possiblefactors would be plus or minus 1 plus orminus 2 plus or minus 4 okay now I haveto find one of those that actually turnsout to be a root or a zero to thefunction so I 'm going to apply syntheticdivision I 'm going to randomly pick oneof those all right let 's just try maybesay negative one let 's try and see if itworks so negative one I want to see ifthis is going to be a root so I 'm goingto put negative one in my little box formy synthetic division I 'm going to takethe coefficients and write them down soI 'm gon na have a 1 5 and 8 for yourrecall so -- thank division this one isgoing to come straight down and then I'mgoing to multiply 1 times negative 1negative 1 we always add going down 5plus a negative 1 is 4 4 times negative1 is negative 4 or 8 plus negative 4that 's 4 4 times negative 1 is anegative 4 4 plus a negative 4 is 0 nowit looks as though I got lucky on thisone all right as long as you get aremainder of 0 then you know that youhave found a root so that 's what we'relooking for is a remainder of 0 now youhad this been any other number otherthan 0 then that would not have workedand I would have had to try positive 1and if that would not have gotten aremainder of 0 then I had to trypositive 2 you have to keep trying eachone of these factors until you come upwith a remainder of 0 all right now whatthis does is this tells me then thatnegative 1 is a root if negative 1 is aroot then a factor of that polynomialexpression would be X plus 1 ok negative1 is a root and from that I can come upwith the factor of x plus 1now I have to come up with the rest ofthe expression and I 'm going to get thatfrom my synthetic division if you recallthis is your plain constant term thiswill be anx-term this will be an x squared andthen the next third so forth so on downline so the rest of this will be xsquared plus 4x plus 4 all right so Ihave factored my original four terms inmy polynomial down to a simplerexpression that has been factored Ifactored into X plus 1 and then xsquared plus 4x plus 4 now you need tocontinuealright this I 'm not going to factoranymore I 'm just going to bring it downthis is our standard trinomial and if weget lucky this is going to factor againall right let 's see I think guy thiswill be a guess and check type factoringon trinomials I 'm going to take factthere 's a 4 which would either be a 1and a 4 or 2 and a 2 I 'm going to use a2 and a 2 so that I get my middle termof a positive 4x that 's going to makethis be a positive that 's going to makethis a positive okay now I havecompletely factored this I can no longerfactor it anymore this is my factoredanswer to my original polynomialexpression test
