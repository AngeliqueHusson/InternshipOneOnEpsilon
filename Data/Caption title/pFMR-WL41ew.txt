right going today looking factor polynomial four term going want attempt grouping first thats easiest procedure right however factor grouping always work right doesnt right suggestion would use rational root theorem allow make factor ing lot easier use rational root theorem use generate list possible root apply synthetic division right thats going break hopefully trinomial going able continue factor polynomial expression four term might attempt factor grouping see x squared would come term two would come term get matching inside term factor grouping going work right case going apply rational root rational root theorem say take ending constant let p take leading integer coefficient case let q able generate possible root equation plus minus p q right going stick q start know know maybe coefficient possible root goes quickly make problem difficult alright p q going give us factor going need look factor would plus minus plus minus plus minus find one actually turns root zero function going apply synthetic division going randomly pick one right let try maybe say negative one let try see works negative one want see going root going put negative one little box formy synthetic division going take coefficient write gon na recall division one going come straight multiply times negative always add going negative times negative plus negative times negative negative plus negative look though got lucky one right long get remainder know found root thats looking remainder number would worked would try positive would gotten remainder try positive keep trying one factor come upwith remainder right tell negative root negative root factor polynomial expression would x plus k root come upwith factor x plus come rest expression going get synthetic division recall plain constant term x squared next third forth downline rest x squared plus plus right original four term polynomial simpler expression x plus x squared plus plus need going going bring standard trinomial get lucky going factor right let see think guy guess check type trinomial going take fact theres would either going use get middle term positive thats going make positive thats going make positive completely longer factor original polynomial expression factor ing rational root theorem factor ing rational root theorem factor ing rational root theorem factor ing rational root theorem factor ing rational root theorem factor ing rational root theorem factor ing rational root theorem
