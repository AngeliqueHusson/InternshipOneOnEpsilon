welcome I want to speak briefly todayabout the harmonic series and there'swonderful paradox that arises from itwhich we 'll get to in a moment first ofall the harmonic series is an infinitesum it 's the sum 1 plus 1/2 plus 1/3plus 1/4 plus 1/5 plus 1/6 and so onthe named harmonic series actually comesfrom Pythagoras the story goes that whenvisiting a blacksmith 's shop he knowsthat middle bars when tapped vibrate andmake it a lovely note and when 2 barsattached simultaneously the two notesthey set they produce make a harmonioussound if their lengths come in wholenumber ratios so these ratios wanted 2 12 3 1 2 4 are the fundamental ratios intwo other ways as well to deal withharmonious notes and this series thenbecame known as the harmonic series umone thing that people notice about itactually has a very peculiar propertythat if you were a human that can existbeyond time and good at your calculateand actually add up added up the sonforever it turns out to be infinite invaluelet me quickly prove that to you as oneof these standard results in calculusbut the there many proofs out there Ica n't like what I 'm about to do next Ithink it 's not kind of Swift let 's givesome a name let 's call it s and I'llprove that if s is a finite number ithas a very strange property that can'tpossibly hold leave me to conclude thatthis must be infinite all right so if sis the sum of this series then s will bebigger than 1/2 plus 1/2 because 1 isbigger than 1/2 plus 1/4 plus 1/4because of 3rd is bigger than 1/4 plus a6 plus a 6 because a 5th is below 6 plus1/8 plus 1/8 and so on so s is biggerthan the second sum but what is thesecond sum 1/2 plus 1/2 is 1 plus 1/4plus 1/4 which is 1/2 I said 6 plus 6 is1/3 plus 1/8 plus 1/8 is a fourth whichis the son again so we have just provedthat the value of the sum s is biggerthan the value of the sum s or s can'tbe a finite number there 's no finitenumber that is bigger than itself so theonly thing I can clued in that this isnot finite and it must be dealing withsome sort of infinite property and thenthere 's an odd little paradox rightthere was it me to say infinity speedsinfinity however very least I 'd say it'snot finite Ohso the fact that this sum adds up to aninfinite quantity leads to a gorgeousparadox which is really quite bizarreMira little squiggle as well um inanother video I discussed somethingcalled whoops I need my pen the basalproblem and in the 1700 soil approvedthat actually if you take the sum andsquare its terms 1 plus 1/4 plus 1/9plus 1/16 plus the 25th and so on thatactually adds up to a finite value it'sPI squared over 6 so it 's about 9 over 6but one at that one and a half andthat 's amazing and actually do prove itin detail in this video so we have lookat the bells a problem video to see thistrue this truth so what I 'd like to donow is give a geometric interpretationof this which has a geometricinterpretation of this first one theharmonic series within it he goes thisfirst one in the Basel series I 'm goingto draw a square of area 1 totallypossible there it is course its sidelength is going to be 1 next that I'lldraw a square of area quarter and ofcourse its side length will be 1/2 andnow I 'll draw a square of area 1/9 itsside length to be one-third and thesquare of area 1/16 so I think the 1/4and 125th and elyda and I 'll pretend I'mbeyond human you can do this foreverall right now let me get out some paintlet me get out about one I 've got agallon and a half of paint because Iknow that this area plus this area plusthis area plus this area plus this areaadds up to finite amount so actually Ican paint all those squares fill in allthe areas there 's only a finite amountof paint finite paint but what thereally weird thing is they 'll go at ared pen and just want to draw the sitebottom sides of each of these squares weknow that this is going to be one unitof ink plus half a unit of ink andlength again something like now but sothird plus 1/4 that is going to take aninfinite amount of ink there 's myparadoxit only takes a finite amount of paintto fill in the whole area of all thesesquares yet with us when this painttouchesside of the square it takes an engineamount of ink to actually draw thebottoms of the squareshow 's that possible how can a finiteamount of paint fill an area butrequired Intermatic paint they shouldjust do all the bottoms of those areasthere lies the paradox and this is thewonderful thing that drovemathematicians nuts for centuries thisare this infinite sum there 's somethingvery is mysterious about what we just goglobally do is dot dot just keep growingforever I guess the question reallybecomes what is dot dot dot really meanbecause we have to think about itcarefully you have to somehow resolve aparadox like this one is n't that cutethanks so much test
