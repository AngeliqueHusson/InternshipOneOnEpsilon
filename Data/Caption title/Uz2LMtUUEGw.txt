Do n't know about you , but I sometimes get really really sick of pi , so last weekI enlisted the help of some friends at a taekwondo club where I train toHelp me with some anger managementHave a lookOkay , so that was funI 'm now working on an extended version in which will kill [ 70,000 ] digits and so the waywe do it is we videotape one cake perDigits or from zero to a ninth of ten different kicks and what I 'll do isI 'll write a program that sticks these film segments together in the right orderYou know 70,000 [ or ] 100,000 of them , and then I 'll have a video that I 'll use every time you know they 'll calculate anotherTrillion digits of Pi or somebody recites like a hundred thousand digits of pi from memory and some fool claims thatThis is somehow mathematically significant . Which it is n't it 's completely pointless as far as mathematics is concernedIt 's a lot of funBut it 's pointless of course since pi is an irrational number it has an infintie of [ non ] [ repeating ] tail of decimalsSo no matter how many decimals I kill there will always be infinitely more to kill so I meanPi is immortal so this is really quite innocent what I 'm doing here . I 'm not really killing anybodyStill it 's a lot [ of ] fun , and you know it [ really ] helps me overcome this Anger all right ? Now I actually learn something in this whole thing that I did n't know beforeSo zero appears in PI for the first time as the 33rd decimalpretty goodpeople already knew aboutThe first 33 decimals in 1600 so as far as I 'm concernedWe could really have stopped calculating at that point in timeYou know 33 digit solid is okay and I would go up to a hundred digits , but after that it 's enough seriouslyWhat are all the digits of pi good for well some people have suggested ? we should use them to communicate with aliens . you broadcast three one four one five andIf they understand they continue the equation , right ? Where 'd you get that ideas son ? biting into this.So you probably know what I think about this idea and what my three legged alien friend here thinks about this ideaBut I 'd be interested in what you think about the idea [ of ] communicating with aliens using the decimal expansion of [ Pi ] Everybody claims . They really care about those digits , but seriously nobody does heres proofThat 's the opening sequence of the movie Pi it 's all about Pi [ its ] movie called PiWell , did you notice anything ? well if you have a really really close looked asThousands here , and there 's many more thousands coming up . It 's only really accurate up to this pointThe rest is just made up somebody just set their typewriter and type widely now here isJust a screenshot from never being kissed it 's the Mathletescelebrating Pi dayWhat can I say ? here 's one that 's very very famousIt 's the life of Pi , and I 'm just going [ to ] play this the scene and you see where they can spot the mistakehe 's really doing this [ by ] [ the ] [ end ] of that day , I was pi patel , a school legendSo did you spot the mistake ? No ? We 're was pretty obviousSo this is the last thing we [ see ] here [ there 's ] like obviously thousands of digits of Pi on on the blackboards here and the last one he writes ... that 's definitely in PiAnd we can actually look it up where it occurs for the first timeSo there 's a really nifty tool on the webWhich is the pi search page , and you just type in a string of numbers ? And it tells you the first time that comes up if it knows itso just type in the last five year four four one seven zero and it tells us that occurs as thethree thousand seven hundred and eighty seventh digit after the decimal pointOkay , so [ he 's ] definitely memorized this thing very well Pi patel main character of the moviehowever when you have a look at the book that the teacher holds and confirms that everything is correct it'sall in FrenchSo if you really really close look it says thereThat what he 's looking at is a table of the digits of PI up to the 2000s digitNow what a mistake , and you [ did n't ] spot itAnyway this this pi search page is actually good one to remember next time you want toyou know count the number of digits on your t-shirt becauseThe best way to do it is actually this curve take the last couple of digitsIn this case , it 's nine nine . Nine . Nine nineNine six nines type them into the search engine and ask when does this show up now ? Is this a Joke nine ? Nine . Nine . Nine nine , nine , nine ... ( it is n't ! ) and that brings us to the main use of of the digit of PI which isPi T-shirtsBut actually when I think about itI 've got a lot of [ Pi ] t-shirts and the best ones actually do n't have anything to do with the digits of Pi have a lookAfter all this pie . I 'm ready to kill a couple more digitsBut this time I 'm going to do it in style with my brand new pie black beltHave a look at this marvelousthree meters and 14 [ centimetres ] exactly [ lots ] lots of digits of Pi of courseHow many digits do you think on this black belt and how many times do you [ think ] this black belt fits around me ?
