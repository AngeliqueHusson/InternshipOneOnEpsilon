let 's now plot these fractions on anumber line some of them are negativebut first of all one is my number linejust has tick marks at every wholenumber so to plot 1/8 I would have totake this here and divide it into eightparts right the first into halves andthen into fourths and then okay it wouldbe the halfway point between zero andone for this here is one it negative 1/8it will be on the other side of zero butequally far away as one Isis it 's rightthere it 's like a mirror point okay forone day 's but you can also think of ityou can divide this number line intohalves and fourths and then into eighthsnegative five eighths okaylet me divide this into eighths now nowI have divided the interval from zero tonegative one into eight parts and then Itravel to negative five eighths you knowif I if I travel to positive fiveeighthsI go this way now just go this way fiveeight one two three four five therewould be negative five eighths one and ahalf okay that 's on the positive side isbetween one and two halfway in betweenone I know that 's easynegative one and three-fourths okay thatis past negative one it 's betweennegative 1 and negative 2 just like oneand three-fourths would be here it 's onthe opposite side okayas if mirrored and let me divide thisinto four parts here so I go to negativeone and then three fourths further rightthere is negative one and three-fourthsand let 's do the same with this decimalnumbers again I have some kind of numberline this one here is negative twotenths well it 's actually a fraction twotenths so this year needinto ten parts and then we go to twotenths towards negative one from zerookay this is negative two tenths 0.23that 's a little bit past two tenths onthe number line so I would have to firstdivide this into ten parts and thenactually to be exact I would need todivide it into hundred parts and then goto 23 hundredthsbut I ca n't easily do that so I 'll justgo to two tenths here and a little bitfurther there would be 23 hundredthsokay negative one point eight okay thatI would go to negative one and theneight tenths further somewhere thereokay you would again divide this intoten parts first then go to the eighthtenth here it 's near negative twonegative two point zero five it is alittle bit a little time beyond negativetwo over there and then 0.92 it 's clearit 's a little bit past arrow point nineover here 0.92 lastly what we 're goingto look at is changing fractions todecimalsokay these are rational numbers everyfraction is it that is a rational numberbut often we want to express them asdecimals and you already know a lot ofthese folks about one-fourth how do youexpress that as a decimal maybe youremember that one-fourth is 1/4 and then1/4 of a dollar is 25 cents or maybe youwanna use equivalent fractions and writeit as 25 hundredths either way we get0.25 and the decimal negative 7 over 20use the same technique we will write itas an equivalent fraction withdenominator hundred it 's negative okay20 goes 5 times 2so seven times five 35 and now it isnegative 0.35 this one here okay thisdoes not 3 does not go evenly twohundred or thousand anything but if youremember one-third was zero point threethree three two three two thirds is zeropoint six six six six six repeating with60s so this ends up being negative onepoint six six six repeating 60s ornegative one point six with a bar on topto indicate the repeating part and ofcourse for most fractions we can not usesomething that we maybe remember or useequivalent fractions now we need to usethis division either with a calculatoror long division this is one of them butyou most likely will not use divisionand so you use long division this waythat 's right 5/16 remember five is whateight by five goes inside this littlecorner long division corner and thenyou 're gon na have this single so putsome decimal zeros here anticipating adecimal number and then 16 goes to fiveseveral times into fifty three times I'msorry48 here okay we get 20 goes once then weget forty it goes two times and then weget anything oh there goes even fivetimes 16 is 80 so this is just negativedecimal number then it is thirty no butwell let 's try the same thing it 's 13 weare dividing by well again just put lotsof decimal zeroes we do n't know if it'sgonna terminate like this one or if thedivision is at some point going tobecome even oh if it is going to be adivision that continues indefinitely thecontinues indefinitely 12 goes to 13once - 10 0 times 208 times then 243times again 243 times okay now it'sgoing to repeat because I see this 1436here the remainder is repeating 1436 etcand 3/7 will repeat here so here so Iget one point zero eight three threefour repeating so I put this bar overthe three threes are gon na repeat theeight will not repeat not a zero so thisis an unending repeating decimal andwhenever you are changing a fraction intraditional you either will get adecimal that terminates like that likethat or you get a decimal that repeatssomething it might even repeat severaldigits not as fun and like I mentionedthere are the symbols that are notrationalthere are decimal numbers that don'trepeat but still go on indefinitelywithout any repeating pattern in theirdigits and also irrational numbers sothere exist numbers that are notrational but that would be a topic ofanother life okay I hope this washelpful How to plot fractions & decimals on a number line; How to convert fractions into decimals How to plot fractions & decimals on a number line; How to convert fractions into decimals How to plot fractions & decimals on a number line; How to convert fractions into decimals
