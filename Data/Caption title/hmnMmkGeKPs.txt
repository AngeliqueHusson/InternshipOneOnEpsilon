Hello , everyone ! My name is James , and today I brought you up tothe roof of the Center of Mathematical Sciencesat Cambridge University.I thought it would be quite nice for you to see.They 've got some grass up here , we 've got some park benches.Today it 's a more personal video.It 's a bit more bloggy.I 'm not a big fan of that , myself.But I go around the countryand I tell people about mathematics , and they ask me '' Why do you study mathematics ? `` And I have to tell them -- well , the honest answer , is because I 'm lazy ! I started studying mathematicsbecause I 'm lazy.Mathematics is the perfect subjectfor the lazy student.There 's no reading lists , no essays to write.If you turn up to lectures , you can do the homework.If you can do the homework , you can do the exam.It really is just the perfect subject for someone like me.The other reason I studied mathematicsis becausefor me , it 's all puzzles and games.And what a great way to make a living ! All it is , it 's just puzzles and games , it 's a lot of fun.But then I came to realizethat mathematics is not this dry , dull , logical subject that people think it is.It 's a very creative subject.People are surprised when I tell them that.But even in mathematics , we have new ideas.And to do anything new , you do need inspiration , intuition , guesswork -- you get it wrong , you go back , you do it again -- and creative thought.And mathematicians talk a lot aboutbeauty and elegance , and it 's true.And in that way , mathematics is a lot closerto something like musicor art.Well , that 's just a little short videoabout why I study mathematics.So if you have been , thanks for watching . test
