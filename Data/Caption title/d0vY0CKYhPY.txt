HOLLY KRIEGER : So what I want to talk aboutis what is maybethe least efficient way possibleto approximate the number pi.BRADY HARAN : Well , that 's not a good sell ! HOLLY KRIEGER : It 's not a good sellbut it 's really interesting.So I wan na talk about approximating pi in the Mandelbrot setMaybe it 's best to do a bit of a reminder aboutwhat the Mandelbrot set is.So , remember , the Mandelbrot setwas this object that we have in thecomplex plane.So , here are the real numbers.And here are the imaginary numbers.And the Mandelbrot set was a collection ofcomplex numbers , so I 'll try and sort ofdraw a nice version of this here.And -- it 's complicated , right ? And it was this collection ofcomplex numbers that had the propertythat when we look at the functionz squared plus c and we applyit to zero , so zero plugged into this functionis c , and then we do that againwith the output.So c plugged into this function is c squared plus c .And so on.A number c is in the Mandelbrot set exactlywhen when we do this process and repeat and repeat and repeatThe number stays smaller than or equal to two.But today I 'm not too worried about complex numbers.I just want to talk about real numbers in the Mandelbrot set.BRADY HARAN : Does that mean we 're just talking about things along the line ? HOLLY KRIEGER : Exactly , exactly.And in fact I 'm just gon na be interested in what happensOn this portion of the real line here.So , one thing that I should say firstis that this point , this point is called the cuspof the Mandelbrot set.And this point is exactly the value wherec is one quarter.BRADY HARAN : That 's the last point on the real line -- in that direction.That 's in the Mandelbrot set . And pi is here somewhere presumably.So pi is not in the Mandelbrot set.HOLLY KRIEGER : Pi is not in the Mandelbrot set.That 's absolutely right.And when I say that I 'm going to approximate pi in the Mandelbrot setI do n't mean I am just gon na approximate pi on this picture hereI mean that I 'm gon na cook up a bunch of numbers that have to dowith the Mandelbrot setthat approximate pi.BRADY HARAN : So you 're going to use the Mandelbrot set as a tool.HOLLY KRIEGER : As a tool to approximate pi , exactly.And , of course , you know , looking at this you can say `` well , it lookslike there 's a circle in there '' .Which , indeed , this is a circle.Inside of the Mandelbrot set.But I 'm not gon na use that one , that 's a little too straightforward of a way to get pi.So , here 's the idea.What happens if we take a real numberThat 's larger than one fourth.So , as you said , it 's not in the Mandelbrot set.Right ? And what that means -- let 's call this number ... Say ... uh ... .Well , I 've already used c , but let 's call it c anywaysWhatever this number c is , when we start doing this processfor this number c , we look at the function z squared plus cand we plug in zero and we output c.Then we plug in the outputand we get c squared plus c , then we plugin that output and so on.At some point , these numbers are gon na be larger than two.Right , because that was our restrictionthat you 're not in the Mandelbrot set if these numbersare eventually larger than two.Okay ? So what we 're gon na do is to eachnumber cwe 're gon na associate this number , say , N of c.And this is equal to the numberof steps of iterating zero under z squared plus c -- So exactly the process I was describing before -- Until we get something larger than two.BRADY HARAN : Any number after the cusp ? HOLLY KRIEGER : Yes.BRADY HARAN : Is a killer ? It 's gon na kill the Mandelbrot set ? HOLLY KRIEGER : That 's right , it eventually gets big.BRADY HARAN : The thing you 're interested in nowis how quickly that number will kill us ? HOLLY KRIEGER : Exactly . And this is somethingthat 's totally natural to be interested inThis is how people draw pictures of the Mandelbrot setfor example , is exactly counting these kinds of steps.So if we start with the real number c that 's larger than twothen after the first stepof iteration here we get c itself which is larger than two.And so we know that after just one stepthat that parameter can not possibly be in the Mandelbrot set.So in that case , N of c is just equal to one.And we have this very small value of N.BRADY HARAN : And that applies to all numbers above two.HOLLY KRIEGER : That 's right , but as you mightimagine , the closer you get into the cusp , the moresteps it takes to get larger than two , right ? We 're starting with the smaller number here and so it takesmore steps to get there.All right . So let 's make this a little bit precise.We start with a number really close to one fourth , say ... Say , c equals one fourth plus epsilon.Where this is some very small positive and real number.BRADY HARAN : So we 're just after the cusp.HOLLY KRIEGER : That 's right , you 're just to the right of the cusp.On the real axis there . And then wecount the number of steps it takes us to escapeThis is something you can do in , say , you know , Wolfram|Alpha or Sage or whatever.Can be the program you wan na use . So if you drawa table of how this number N of c depends as epsilonis coming in and getting smaller and smaller , we 're coming in towards the cusp with cyou can actually count , just by iterating , how long does it take to havea number that 's larger than two.So for example , if epsilon is one , then c is one plus one fourth , which is one point two five.Then N of c is just two.It only takes two steps to get larger than two.BRADY HARAN : Well that was , uh , that was over quickly.HOLLY KRIEGER : That 's right . On the other hand if wetake some much more reasonable value of epsilon , say likeOne one-hundredth , and so c is point two six , say ... Then the number of steps it takes to escape turns out to beThirty , actually.And if we take epsilon to be , sayEven smaller , and so c is even closer to one quarter , then the value we get in that case is three fifteen.BRADY HARAN : Oh , wow , that 's a lot of steps.HOLLY KRIEGER : It 's a lot of steps , right , but we 're reallyclose to the cusp here , it should take a lot of steps to escape.And if we take epsilon even smaller , so that c is even closer to the cuspWe get something even better.Even larger value of N of c.BRADY HARAN : Ooooh ... HOLLY KRIEGER : But you can see something suspicious happening here , right ? BRADY HARAN : I can see it . We can all see it.HOLLY KRIEGER : Everyone can see it.So , what 's happening here is as long as you put the decimalpoint in the right placeAnd as you can see , I 've changed my epsilon sort of regularly here , so the decimalpoint kind of moves regularly , too.As long as you put the decimal pointin the right place , these values N of care actually converging to pi.BRADY HARAN : That 's cool ! HOLLY KRIEGER : Yeah , yeah ! So you get these approximations of piright , okay , three point one five is not such a good approximationthree point one four is a little better , it turns out the next oneis something like three one four one four.Which is even betterand so on.And so , this tremendously inefficient method of taking some valueof c that 's really close to the cusp of the Mandelbrot set and iteratingit many thousands of times until you get a number that 's larger than twowill give you approximates of pi .
