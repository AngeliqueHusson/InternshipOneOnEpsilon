today breakthrough famous tough unsolved problem mathematics time petition video id like give brief introduction petition give ill try prove thing give sense kent owner announce couple month sago petition whats really child play actually game imagine block want make train suppose want make train four long lots elderly one unit wide two wide three four five unit sword maybe six seven eight road going ask many train make dimension well mean might range simply row make elect fall id put three one together train ill describe three plus one like four guess could also actually put order train one plus three question many make theres two example guess ill keep game study train two plus two maybe block four exciting train train ah maybe could table complicated one plus one plus two guess could rearrange train one plus two plus one guess arrange rearrange aswell train two plus one plus one people might like might say thats basically example different order thats good let talk ordered moment think still make another train see four doesnt matter would ever answer guess another option one plus one plus one plus done good technique sort round room one two three four five six seven eight eight ways trainer collection consider order important four block train sorry chain like four block important look like eight ways see treasure handwriting excuse guess two example would example guess block four fine guess decided three would set ordered could still look like theres one two three four five unordered number four use word partition thats official math word ways break number case number four smaller part could whole number could whole bunch could thing theres two type petition ordered partition unordered partition let talk next seeing want make length care order block use eight ways make train length four may want pause play tried fill table obviously first easy anyway going make train length one guess one way fill getting two three certainly higher anyways going make train length two order considered important well block length two two like theres two ways bad three could three could good block two one block one two theres four ways make train length three exit exercise maybe pause moment play turns sixteen ways make train length five thirty two ways make train length look suspect might mathematical formula going herein fact look like train length number less whoops number al den partition n minus true prove really making length band whose name reaching tissue make length well take basic four block could look four block see theres actually eight ways make train length well three block put plus sign space solution one plus one plus one plus one measure chose put plus sign space ill determine well without regard lack plus side theres plus side space like competition two plus one plus one maybe instead ill choose put plus sign middle bottom plus sign end smudgy put plus sign middle first position like plus sign like got train one plus three actually making partition important length equivalent simply choosing put plus sign space put plus sign space two choice space three space total number choice must two three ways make order train length thats explain general n n possible train considered important n minus space two choice right thats ordered partition break unordered partition right ordered two thats unordered partition number order doesnt matter get like become convention always put higher small near end petition number four three plus plus two two plus one plus one whole bunch five number four fact mathematician say usually think ways order petition number particular number whats going n p let make stand petition number weve shown fourth one five fun like block make sure fill table example theres one way petition number one one could one plus one theres two ways digit number two number three three ways thing get bit harder turns seven ways petition number five might want check number six eleven ways right excited look one two three five seven eleven actually order find formula petition always find form seem easy question ah unfortunately dont foo led forfeit ways petition number theres twenty two ways petition check thats definitely prime believe ways believe theres dont head put trusty paper tend grow turns theyre ways petition number exercise double check thing start get little two hundred twenty six ways petition number grow mighty first try million nine hundred sixty nine two hundred ninety two different ways thousand going number thirty two long two point four huge number partition grow incredibly fast incredibly quickly unsolved problem thats well maybe possible find formula partition theres around first person good crack partition part accessible overview tan ton mathematics
