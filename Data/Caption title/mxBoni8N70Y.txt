video going talk graph ing linear function finding x intercept intercept ways graph use slope intercept form definitely another way thats common technique actually works find x general well idea function one thing kind special know function goes since linear well got look like line move point little bit know since line two point uniquely determine graph linear function order graph function going instead kind finding arbitrarily going find two specific point namely going find intercept going find x intercept two point simply play connect dot give graph well go finding example intercept well thing notice find intercept anywhere along axis x equal well matter height always zero value dont know trying figure basically say find let x equal find x think way anywhere along x axis n know x point generically would like find know simply plug equal solve summary say find substitute equal zero solve x say find intercept going substitute x equal zero solve let couple example mean obviously one thing going important simply first place given linear function maybe tell hey linear function graph suppose instruction say graph say plus equal method finding x intercept sand intercept look see x first power first power neither denominator equal sign kind floating around notice x wire first power going indicate linear function define intercept find intercept simply going plug value x plug x get times plus times well times simply left equation divide sides whoops get value say imagine plotting point say get going point graph linear function goes thing well find find x intercept simply substitute value zero time plug equation get two x plus four times zero equal twelve four times zero simply zero point plugging equal zero equation one variable well get equal x equal think little chart say plug value zero get six x point six comma play connect dot cant get look pretty good would graph function whoops graph line plus equal maybe one real quick think maybe go one touch fix graph real n know let graph equal k exact idea want find order doesnt really matter find find let equal get times equal times left equal spart equation divide sides simply left well usually leave fraction n make mixed likewise find intercept analogous thing simply substitute get times minus times simply going us part gone divide sides negative get ay value negative time graph going negative two point enough graph linear function play connect dot graph linear function minus equal hopefully nothing nothing bad think know worst thing might happen equation end kind weird weird fraction whatever otherwise think x intercept method pretty good way graph linear equation equal going horizontal line maybe equal would vertical line still need recognize linear equation type linear equation trick finding x intercept hope help question shoot happy try make sense graph ing linear function finding x intercept graph ing linear function finding x intercept graph ing linear function finding x intercept graph ing linear function finding x intercept graph ing linear function finding x intercept graph ing linear function finding x intercept graph ing linear function finding x intercept graph ing linear function finding x intercept graph ing linear function finding x intercept graph ing linear function finding x intercept
