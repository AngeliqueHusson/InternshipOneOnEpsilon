already made video arc sine arc tangent already made video arc sine arc tangent kind complete might well video like inverse trigonometric function kind thought process tell arc cosine tell arc cosine x equal theta equivalent statement saying inverse cosine x equal theta two different ways writing exact thing soon see either arc anything inverse trig function general brain brain immediately say saying take cosine angle theta going get x statement either boil say know inverse cosine x angle take cosine get x said let try say arc told two c reim told evaluate arc cosine minus brain know let say going equal going equal angle equivalent saying cosine mystery angle equal minus soon put way least brain becomes lot easier process let draw unit circle see make headway thats let see draw little could actually draw put ruler ruler maybe draw straight linelet thats axis neatly drawn axes ever draw unit like unit ellipse get idea cosine angle defined unit circle definition x value unit circle angle x value going tobe equal minus got minus right angle solve theta angle intersect unit circle minus let see angle trying figure theta need determine minus right figure different angle sand way like think like figure angle right know angle subtract get light blue angle thats kind solution problem let make triangle little bit bigger triangle let like triangle look something like distance right distance right distance right recognize going triangle could actually solve get square root solve side need theorem actually let let call dont know call youd get squared plus squared equal squared get squared equal equal square root immediately know triangle know sides triangle hypotenuse square root also know side opposite square root side right angle right one care angle right figured whats whats bigger angle care degree supplementary supplementary arc cosine inverse cosine let write arc cosine minus equal write minus whole thing right degree plus wan ted write radian write times pi radian per degree degree cancel equal pi right equal pi radian snow like saw arc sine probably say hey k pi give cosine minus write cosine pi equal minus give information statement keep going around unit circle example could point cosine angle add go far would also minus could go pi around get back theres lot value take cosine ill get minus restrict restrict value take essentially restrict ing range restrict ing range restrict range upper hemisphere first second say make statement x equal theta going restrict range theta theta going greater equal less equal oh sorry equal pi right also degree restrict ing part hemisphere right cant point cosine angle equal minus cant take angle outside range valid value x well angle take cosine minus plus x domain arc cosine function going x less equal greater equal minus let go check see value got arc cosine minus really pi calculated turn need figure inverse cosine thing arc cosine minus minus give decimal strange see thats thing pi times pi divided equal exact number calculator gave value got kind useless well useless number valid answer doesnt nice clean answer didnt know pi radian sand unit circle able get answer hopefully actually let ask let finish interesting question ask know say take x take cosine going equal statement right said well let say arc cosine x equal theta mean cosine theta equal x right arc cosine x equal theta replace theta cosine theta well cosine theta x whole thing going x hopefully didnt get confuse saying look arc cosine x call theta definition mean cosine theta equal x equivalent completely equivalent statement right put theta right take cosine theta equal x let ask bonus slightly question ask true x put true x value negative two going true ask arc cosine cosine theta going equal answer depend theta theta theta range theta theta pi range kind range product equal theta true take theta try outlet take let one theta take arc cosine cosine let take cosine let stick cosine pi cosine pi radian thats thing arc cosine minus pi minus saw ear lier part video solve said oh equal pi range theta pi worked thats arc cosine function produce value pi ask arc cosine cosine dont know piso draw unit circle let draw unit circle real quick one thats axes whats pi go around go around another pi end right gone around times unit circle pi whats minus cosine pi minus right whats arc cosine minus minus remember range set value evaluate upper hemisphere pi arc cosine negative going piso going negative negative negative thats reasonable statement difference pi pi going around unit circle couple get equivalent kind equivalent point unit circle thought would throw two one mean useful one well actually let write one useful one cosine arc cosine x always going xi could also sine sine arc sine x also going x useful thing shouldnt memorize obviously might memorize wrong way think little bit never forget inverse trig function arc cos trigonometry khan academy inverse trig function arc cos
