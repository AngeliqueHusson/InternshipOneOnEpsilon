The circle is arguably the most fundamental shape in ouruniverse , whether you look at the shapes of orbits ofplanets , whether you look at wheels , whether you look atthings on kind of a molecular level.The circle just keeps showing up over andover and over again.So it 's probably worthwhile for us to understand some of theproperties of the circle.So the first thing when people kind of discovered the circle , and you just have a look at the moon to see a circle , but thefirst time they said well , what are the propertiesof any circle ? So the first one they might want to say is well , a circleis all of the points that are equal distant from thecenter of the circle.All of these points along the edge are equal distant fromthat center right there.So one of the first things someone might want to ask iswhat is that distance , that equal distance that everythingis from the center ? Right there.We call that the radius of the circle.It 's just the distance from the center out to the edge.If that radius is 3 centimeters , then this radiusis going to be 3 centimeters.And this radius is going to be 3 centimeters.It 's never going to change.By definition , a circle is all of the points that are equaldistant from the center point.And that distance is the radius.Now the next most interesting thing about that , people mightsay well , how fat is the circle ? How wide is it along its widest point ? Or if you just want to cut it along its widest point , whatis that distance right there ? And it does n't have to be just right there , I could have justas easily cut it along its widest point right there.I just would n't be cutting it like some place like thatbecause that would n't be along its widest point.There 's multiple places where I could cut italong its widest point.Well , we just saw the radius and we see that widest pointgoes through the center and just keeps going.So it 's essentially two radii.You got one radius there and then you have anotherradius over there.We call this distance along the widest point of thecircle , the diameter.So that is the diameter of the circle.It has a very easy relationship with the radius.The diameter is equal to two times the radius . Now , the next most interesting thing that you might bewondering about a circle is how far is it around the circle ? So if you were to get your tape measure out and you were tomeasure around the circle like that , what 's that distance ? We call that word the circumference of the circle.Now , we know how the diameter and the radius relates , but howdoes the circumference relate to , say , the diameter.And if you 're not really used to the diameter , it 's veryeasy to figure out how it relates to the radius.Well , many thousands of years ago , people took their tapemeasures out and they keep measuring circumferencesand radiuses.And let 's say when their tape measures were n't so good , let 's say they measured the circumference of the circleand they would get well , it looks like it 's about 3.And then they measure the radius of the circle right hereor the diameter of that circle , and they 'd say oh , the diameterlooks like it 's about 1.So they would say -- let me write this down.So we 're worried about the ratio -- let mewrite it like this.The ratio of the circumference to the diameter . So let 's say that somebody had some circle over here -- let'ssay they had this circle , and the first time with not thatgood of a tape measure , they measured around the circleand they said hey , it's roughly equal to 3 meterswhen I go around it.And when I measure the diameter of the circle , it 's roughly equal to 1.OK , that 's interesting.Maybe the ratio of the circumference ofthe diameter 's 3.So maybe the circumference is always threetimes the diameter.Well that was just for this circle , but let 's say theymeasured some other circle here.It 's like this -- I drew it smaller.Let 's say that on this circle they measured around it andthey found out that the circumference is 6 centimeters , roughly -- we have a bad tape measure right then.Then they find out that the diameter isroughly 2 centimeters.And once again , the ratio of the circumference of thediameter was roughly 3.OK , this is a neat property of circles.Maybe the ratio of the circumference to the diametersalways fixed for any circle.So they said let me study this further.So they got better tape measures.When they got better tape measures , they measured hey , my diameter 's definitely 1.They say my diameter's definitely 1 , but when Imeasure my circumference a little bit , I realizeit 's closer to 3.1 . And the same thing with this over here.They notice that this ratio is closer to 3.1.Then they kept measuring it better and better and better , and then they realized that they were getting this number , they just kept measuring it better and better and they weregetting this number 3.14159.And they just kept adding digits and it wouldnever repeat.It was a strange fascinating metaphysical numberthat kept showing up.So since this number was so fundamental to our universe , because the circle is so fundamental to our universe , and it just showed up for every circle.The ratio of the circumference of the diameter was thiskind of magical number , they gave it a name.They called it pi , or you could just give it the Latin or theGreek letter pi -- just like that.That represents this number which is arguably the mostfascinating number in our universe.It first shows up as the ratio of the circumference to thediameter , but you 're going to learn as you go through yourmathematical journey , that it shows up everywhere.It 's one of these fundamental things about the universe thatjust makes you think that there 's some order to it.But anyway , how can we use this in I guessour basic mathematics ? So we know , or I 'm telling you , that the ratio of thecircumference to the diameter -- when I say the ratio , literally I 'm just saying if you divide the circumference bythe diameter , you're going to get pi.Pi is just this number.I could write 3.14159 and just keep going on and on and on , but that would be a waste of space and it would just be hardto deal with , so people just write this Greekletter pi there.So , how can we relate this ? We can multiply both sides of this by the diameter and wecould say that the circumference is equal to pitimes the diameter.Or since the diameter is equal to 2 times the radius , we couldsay that the circumference is equal to pi times 2times the radius.Or the form that you're most likely to see it , it 's equal to 2 pi r.So let 's see if we can apply that to some problems.So let 's say I have a circle just like that , and I were totell you it has a radius -- it 's radius right there is 3.So , 3 -- let me write this down -- so the radius is equal to 3.Maybe it 's 3 meters -- put some units in there.What is the circumference of the circle ? The circumference is equal to 2 times pi times the radius.So it 's going to be equal to 2 times pi times the radius , times 3 meters , which is equal to 6 meters timespi or 6 pi meters.6 pi meters.Now I could multiply this out.Remember pi is just a number.Pi is 3.14159 going on and on and on.So if I multiply 6 times that , maybe I 'll get 18 pointsomething something something.If you have your calculator you might want to do it , but forsimplicity people just tend to leave our numbersin terms of pi.Now I do n't know what this is if you multiply 6 times3.14159 , I do n't know if you get something close to 19 or18 , maybe it 's approximately 18 point somethingsomething something.I do n't have my calculator in front of me.But instead of writing that number , you justwrite 6 pi there.Actually , I think it would n't quite cross thethreshold to 19 yet.Now , let 's ask another question.What is the diameter of the circle ? Well if this radius is 3 , the diameter is just twice that.So it 's just going to be 3 times 2 or 3 plus 3 , whichis equal to 6 meters.So the circumference is 6 pi meters , the diameter is 6meters , the radius is 3 meters.Now let 's go the other way.Let 's say I have another circle.Let 's say I have another circle here.And I were to tell you that its circumference is equalto 10 meters -- that 's the circumference of the circle.If you were to put a tape measure to go around it andsomeone were to ask you what is the diameter of the circle ? Well , we know that the diameter times pi , we know that pi timesthe diameter is equal to the circumference ; isequal to 10 meters.So to solve for this we would just divide both sidesof this equation by pi.The diameter would equal 10 meters over pi or10 over pi meters.And that is just a number.If you have your calculator , you could actually divide 10divided by 3.14159 , you're going to get 3 point somethingsomething something meters.I ca n't do it in my head.But this is just a number.But for simplicity we often just leave it that way.Now what is the radius ? Well , the radius is equal to 1/2 the diameter.So this whole distance right here is 10 over pi meters.If we just 1/2 of that , if we just want the radius , wejust multiply it times 1/2.So you have 1/2 times 10 over pi , which is equal to 1/2 times10 , or you just divide the numerator and thedenominator by 2.You get 5 there , so you get 5 over pi.So the radius over here is 5 over pi.Nothing super fancy about this.I think the thing that confuses people the most is to justrealize that pi is a number.Pi is just 3.14159 and it just keeps going on and on and on.There 's actually thousands of books written about pi , soit 's not like -- I do n't know if there 's thousands , I'mexaggerating , but you could write books about this number.But it 's just a number.It 's a very special number , and if you wanted to write it in away that you 're used to writing numbers , you could literallyjust multiply this out.But most the time people just realize they like leavingthings in terms of pi.Anyway , I 'll leave you there.In the next video we 'll figure out the area of a circle . test
