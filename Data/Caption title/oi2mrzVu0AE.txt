okay now we 'll talk about numericalcalculation of derivatives and rememberhow we originally calculated anapproximate value for a derivative if wehave some function of X say it 's somecurve in the plane like this and we havesome x value like this and we want tofind the slope of the curve at thispoint so how steep is the curve at thatpoint well what we do is we take alittle value over here to the right andso this distance right here is ourchange in X so this point is X plusDelta X and maybe this is a really smalldistance like point 0 0 1 or reallysmall increment Delta X and then we takethis point here and we take the slopebetween those two points and if this ifthis Delta ax is a really smallincrement then the slope between thosetwo points is a good approximation tothe slope of the curve at the pointwe 're interested in and the calculationhere is pretty easy if this is X righthere then this is f of X and if this isX plus Delta X then this Y value is f ofX plus Delta X and so the slope is goingto be the rise over the run and so theslope calculation is this it 's f of Xplus Delta X minus f of X over Delta Xand this is what we call a differencequotient and specifically this is whatwe call a forward difference quotientbecause we 've moved to the right from Xhere we 've gone to the right of thisincremental amount Delta X we could alsouse a backward different differencequotient if we had gone back this way wewould have another point on the graphback here and we 'd have a little slopehere and we could also get a fairlyaccurate estimate going backward alongthe x axis and of course the smaller theincrement the more accurate it isnow instead of going forward or backwardwe could also do bothI could go forward just a little bit tothis this position here I 'll call it Xplus Delta X and I could go backward tothis position here I 'll call that Xminus Delta X and so I end up with apoint here and a point here and then ifI connect those two points I get a slopethat is a good approximation to theslope at the point I 'm interested inright there and it 's arguable thatthat 's a better approximation becauseyou can see the way this curve goes thiscurve is concave down and if I juststart from this point and go forward youcan see if I go really far forward I endup with a slope that is less than theslope at the point here so going forwardin this case tends to underestimate myslope and going backward you could seeif I went really far I would end up withthe slope that is steeper than the slopeat this point so going backward in thiscase tends to overestimate the slope andthat 's often the case going onedirection will tend to overestimate inone direction will tend to underestimateand if you go both directions at thesame time those two errors will tend tocancel each other outin most cases and this is called asymmetric difference quotient we goforward a certain amount and backward acertain amount and we get twocorresponding y-values to these X valuesand we can name these this is f of Xplus Delta X and f of X minus Delta Xand then the slope calculation would bethis it would simply be the rise overthe run and so the rise would be f of Xplus Delta X minus f of X minus Delta Xover two Delta X and this is what thecalculator does when you do a numericalapproximation to a derivative using thein Durov function on the calculator andwe 'll do this in just a second it doesthis it takes it 's you 're you 're goingto tell the calculator to calculate theslopeof a curve at a particular point andwhat it does it knows how to compute they values because you 've told it thisfunction and so it just scoots forward alittle bit and backward a little bit andcomputes those corresponding Y valuescalculates the rise and the run andgives you your your quotient there therise over the run as the slope so here'san example f of X is equal to x squaredwe 're told to find the slope of functionf at x equals 1.5 so on the calculatorwe 're going to type this into Riv andthen you give it the function you put inparentheses here the function then youtell it X and 1.5 and what this means iscalculate the derivative numericallythat 's what the N stands for so it 's anumerical approximation to thederivative of this function when thevariable x equals 1.5 and so what thecalculator does it actually is going tocalculate values x squared as we knowlooks something like this and it 's goingto come over here to x equals 1.5 andit 's going to go to the right of 1.5 avery tiny amount 0.001 and I'mexaggerating it in this picture and it'sgoing to go to the left of 1.5 by 0.001so it 's actually going to be findingthese values here one point five zerozero one and one point four nine nineI guess one point five zero one and onepoint four nine nine and it 's going tocalculate those Y values based on thefunction we 've told it to use and thenit will do a rise over run and well thatwill be an approximation to the slope atthis point so let 's do it here 's thehere 's the calculator turn this thing onand you hit the you need to hit the mathkey which is right here and math andoption eight if you go down and you canjust press 8 and it says in Durov andthere 's the open parenthesis and it'swaiting for three arguments so let'stype in the function x squared comma andthen xand comma and then 1.5 and hit enter andit tells us it has a slope of 3 right atthat point so that 's the derivative ofthe x squared function at x equals onepoint five okay here 's another examplef of X is x cubed minus 4x squared findthe slope at x equals two and we 'll dothis on the calculator by typing inDurov x cubed minus 4x squared comma xcomma 2 and let 's see what we get soI 'll hit math 8 and it says in Durov andthen I 'm going to type X cubed and I'lljust do X to the power of 3 like that Xcubed minus 4x squared comma so that'smy function and then comma so thederivative of that function when X commais equal to 2 and I like to hit theclose parentheses and then hit enter andlook what I get negative three pointnine nine nine nine nine nine nine nineand I 'm gon na go out on a limb and saythat that really should be negative fourso my answer here is negative four andthe reason it did n't say negative fourthe reason it gave me all those decimalplaces is because this is really just anapproximation it 's not exactly correctso when you see something like this itreally does make sense to round it tonegative four okay so that 's anintroduction to the in Durov function onthe calculator we 'll come back in thenext video and do some more examples andI 'll show you some different ways to usethe indirect function on the calculatorand some places where it can beparticularly useful test
