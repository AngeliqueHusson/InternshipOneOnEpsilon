hi rob welcome math antic sin last algebra video learned algebra involve variable unknown value learned equation mean unknown value video going learn solve simple algebraic equation involve addition subtraction next video learn solve simple equation multiplication division ready thought got equation unknown value key strategy rearrange equation unknown value one side equal sign known side equal sign know unknown value rearrange equation well know algebra still four main arithmetic operation addition subtraction multiplication division use operation rearrange equation long understand one really important thing first need understand equation like balance scale seen balance scale right amount weight side scale two sides balance add weight one side scale tip two sides longer balance equation like whatever one side equal sign must exactly value whatever side otherwise equation would true course mean two sides look example equation look like number know value balance true equation reason need know equation must start rear ranging careful might something would change one sides would make equation get balance true happen get right answer solve pretty bad huh avoid avoid getting equation balance key whenever make change equation make exact change sides important say whenever something equation thing sides example want add something one side equation add thing side want subtract something one side equation subtract thing side multiplication division want multiply one side equation number need multiply side number want divide one side equation number divide side number also long always thing sides equation stay balance equation still true alright like said video going focus equation addition subtraction first example x solve unknown value x need rearrange equation x one side equal sign get x well right x added way us get rid yes since seven added x undo subtract ing side would leave x x plus minus x plus minus cancel great subtract side equation x solve right wrong subtract one side equation side equation balance keep equation balance also need subtract side equation side number need subtract since side equation become subtract ing sides change original equation x new much simpler equation x tell us unknown number solve equation check answer make sure got right see would happen unknown value original equation number x right true know got right answer pretty cool huh let try another one x time unknown value right hand side equation make harder nope use exact strategy want get x time x added thanks commutative property added x isolate x subtract side equation also need subtract side keep thing balance right side x plus minus x minus cancel positive side minus would leave equation become x x solve equation whenever something added unknown undo get unknown subtract ing something sides equation something unknown like example x case x subtracter taken away could get rid undo minus yep undo subtraction time need add sides equation minus plus cancel leave x side side equation x equal try another example like x x cancel minus add sides equation right side minus plus cancel leaving x left know x know solve simple equation like something added unknown something unknown try practic ing want show tricky variation subtraction problem confuse lot remember subtraction commutative property switch order subtraction different problem suppose get problem instead number taken away unknown unknown taken away number case well still want get unknown little harder see problem x side positive could subtract sides would get rid problem get rid minus sign minus sign really x since x would leave us negative x side equal sign wrong might know work negative yet fortunately another way kind problem avoid getting negative unknown instead subtract ing sides would happen added x sides add unknown sides well sure add subtract anything want long sides minus x plus x cancel side side get x equation x might thinking would even solve equation true change equation already know solve easy see isolate unknown subtract ing sides equation give us x x took us one extra step rearrange equation easy basic simple algebraic equation involve addition subtraction need get unknown value subtract ing something sides equation process works even equation decimal fraction sand also works matter symbol could x z b c letter used matter remember
