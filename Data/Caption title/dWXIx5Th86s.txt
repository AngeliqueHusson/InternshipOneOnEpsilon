one application space diagonal right space diagonal diagonal space vertices along bases lateral mean abox space diagonal go vertex middle box opposite corner four ill draw inone let say star ted vertex right upper left space diagonal go lower right vertex drew gon na look something like order calculate length space diagonal gon na use theorem going diagonal along base face know aright angle problem apply rectangular prism find one like find leg use theorem squared plus b squared equal c squared find length space diagonal theres three would extend vertex one front left could one back left extending front right finally back right extending front left key problem space diagonal apply theorem usually going apply space diagonal space diagonal space diagonal space diagonal space diagonal
