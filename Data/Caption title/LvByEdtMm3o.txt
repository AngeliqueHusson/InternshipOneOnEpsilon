hey another math theater help boost score math class improve understanding hopefully make learning math lot less stressful going video shift translate know reflect different type parent function let get right video look example first want familiar familiarize lot basic graph recognize basic shape graph basic equation thats starting point go real quick square root function half parabola side absolute value function like real sharp v vertex origin cal led reciprocal function ax x see actually hyperbola approach es x axes equal x cube integer function look course equal x squared thats u shaped graph parabola let talk transforming graph let start one root x say example graph equal square root x minus think graph well said right basically way want think whatever number grouped x going shift graph gon na affect x horizontal direction opposite know minus right positive plus actually would shift left show graph actually going shifting graph right theres graph far let look another example let say absolute value x say graph equal x plus think plus graph parent function said shift left right notice see grouped ax right grouped ax opposite effect actually shifting graph left vertex negative everything left let go next graph x gon na going multiply basically said x think graph said shift vertical sorry vertical stretch multiplying value exactly right would happen normally graphic goes point see put thats going going thing hereat negative going negative whats happening vertical stretch like direction han g going show general concept let go next one equal x cube write parent function general way like equal x minus h k weve already kind know gotten familiar number thats group x affecting x direction right minus shifting right plus left one group x opposite effect k value effect add graph going shift two subtract two going shift number front going vertically less going compress k far example let say graph equal x cube plus right see going multiplying thats vertical compression going graph shifting lot student dook ay lot recommend theyll say know shifting let think point starting point taken account well well focus core function going make table value going say like x going picksome easy value right put negative thats negative cube half one would positive half going instead graph ing going treat point like origin zero zero negative one graph look like see compressed another example let take look step function say graph equal negative k probably seeing multiplying everything negative one value make opposite reflecting x axis k happen graph instead stair going like going reflecting theyre going going direction sofar k let look equal x say wan ted graph x squared thing pay attention see grouped x grouped x affect x direction opposite fashion however want say basically instead multiplying x two dividing actually going horizontal compression basically whats going happen normally graph goes going negative basically compressed way see like hey let look want make little bit let say example like say example took back square root x function say wan ted graph square root x plus minus k see actually going shift graph left going vertical stretch three going tobe one reason way following order operation multiplication division addition subtraction think working inside think order wan ted kind like knob slow mole right slow motion start basic graph might say dont know basic graph well go ahead make core graph picksome value zero square root basic point plot say going subtract subtract ill beat negative going negative graph looking something like like left going value multiplying vertical stretch instead know negative going negative point right actually going moving going like vertical going shifting thing minus value point going go like might say like work right let another way another way student sand approach theyll say let take shift account first let say know going shift left right let treat point like starting point like origin weve taken guy account graph kind core graph core equation core function point origin make lot simpler make table pick take square root square root times square root times root times plot zero zero right one three right four three four six see graph graph got depending teacher want say describe order order operation shifting left vertical stretch three shifting recommend translation translation shifting thats like rigid transformation treat starting point cover involved shift graph core function remember pick shift multiplying dividing stretch compress key thing remember grouped x opposite effect two actually divide two dividing two say like would actually x value c huse would horizontal stretch thing subtract ing like subtract two going right add two going left two group ax like say put one thats going shift one change minus one going shift one put four front thats gon na vertical stretch affecting value multiplying four half going compress ing vertically last negative gon na reflecting x axis one last one bonus tip right say example like equal negative x see negative group x affecting x value making opposite actually going reflect axis going reflect like whereas negative front thats going affect value going multiply value negative one reflected x axis lot information start learning parent function go conclude video subscribe channel
