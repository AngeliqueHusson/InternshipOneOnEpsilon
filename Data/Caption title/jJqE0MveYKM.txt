okay in this video I want to talk aboutfactoring using the greatest commonfactor and in this video I want to doexamples where we have to factor outbinomial expressions so sometimes thisis enough to throw people off when theysee things in parentheses but the ideais exactly the same so in this case whatI do again kind of what I 'm recognizingvisually I see a 3x squared times a setof parentheses this 2x plus 5y this isall one term the 3 is a factor the xsquared is a factor and then to me I seethe 2x plus 5y is a factor likewise wehave another term I see a 7 as a factorthe Y squared and the quantity 2x plus5y as a factor okay so when I go tofactor things out again the first thingI think is you know what 's the greatestcommon factor of 3 & 7well the biggest number that dividesevenly into both of those is justpositive 1 so there 's really nothing tofactor out I see an X to a power in thefirst one but the second the second termhas wise but no X 's so I ca n't factorout any X 's or Y 's but I do see the samething in parentheses I see this 2x plus5y that 's the thing that is in common toboth of them so that means we can factorit out okay so I 'm going to pull outthis quantity 2x plus 5y and then I needtwo things since I have two termsoriginally one term two terms that meansin the parentheses I 'm going to need twoterms as well and again just two whenyou factor to me you know I kind ofimagine you know in my head now I'vepulled this thing out so it 's gone sowhat 's left well in the first term theonly thing that 's left is 3x squared sothat 's what I would needto be the first term in the set ofparentheses and likewise for the secondfactor since I pulled out the 2x plus 5yalready the only thing that that I stillneed is the plus 7y squared and now wefactored out the greatest common factorit was a binomial 3x squared plus 7ysquared definitely does n't factor anyfurther alright so same idea in the nextone we have a 5x squared X plus 3y minus15 X cubed x plus 3y same thoughtprocess I see one big term and then Isee another big term so I think 5 and 15well the greatest common factor 5 and 15would be 5 then I say oh they both haveX 's 2 powers there 's an x squared and anX cubed again we have to pull out thesmaller exponent which would just be xsquared and then I also notice heythere 's an X plus 3y that 's in common soI can also factor that out okay so inthis case we factored out a lot of stuffso I think what needs to go back in theparentheses to give me my original thingback again since there 's 1 2 terms I'llneed 2 terms in there you could alwaysthink about their having been you knowwe can multiply the first term by 1 andif we use the same idea about kind ofthinking well what did you factor outwell we factored out the 5 we factoredout the x squared we factored out the Xplus 3 y the only thing that 's leftwould be the x one so that 's what I'mgoing to need as my first term in theparentheses and again if you multiplyall that stuff by one it 'll just giveyou exactly back the the first the firstterm in our original expression so thatI think 5 times what is negative 15 wellwe 'll need a negative 3x squared times what is x cubed Ibelieve we would just need an X andagain we 've already factored out the xplus 3y so we 've already accounted forthat by factoring it out so again let memove my parentheses in here a little bitcloser so it says if you factor youcould factor the second expression is 5xsquared X plus 3 y 1 minus 3x sofactoring is definitely something that Ithink it takes most people I 'm suremyself included to get a good handle onit it 's something that as long as you'redoing any sort of algebra precalculuscalculus statistics factoring does n't goaway so it 's definitely something that Ithink I recommend to people too youreally want to practice and make sureyou get as good of a grasp on it aspossible like I said this is one ofthose things it just does n't go away andit 's something that you want to becertainly familiar familiar with in avariety of situations so all rightanyways I hope these examples help andmake some sense Factoring Using the Great Common Factor, GCF - Example 2 - Factoring Out Binomials Factoring Using the Great Common Factor, GCF - Example 2 - Factoring Out Binomials Factoring Using the Great Common Factor, GCF - Example 2 - Factoring Out Binomials
