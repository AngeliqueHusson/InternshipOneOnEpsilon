squared minus plus one divided x plus three going set weve got x plus three going x squared minus plus want want see like many times x go x squared think working backwards could say times x x squared want try match first term subtract want eliminate first term thats going x going going distribute x times x x squared x times want want subtract teach lot theyll change opposite subtraction opposite see cancel get negative say times x negative could say many times x going negative whats negative divided x well thats going negative going distribute negative term give us negative minus going change science opposite add comes see zero th degree constant first degree x first lower degree remainder final answer going x minus remainder divisor take remainder final answer see x plus didnt go evenly remainder take remainder divisor like showing long division problem long time ago k let stake look another example dividing long polynomial process gon na see many times go cube thats going x squared k notice lining squared keep going distribute give us cube squared going change opposite add thats really like subtract ing get squared plus plus many times go negative six x squared thats going distribute term negative plus going change science opposite add give us plus trying see many times go little thats three halves going distribute get three x minus three halves change sign opposite add thats going give really like halves plus constant degree two x thats remainder going remainder dividing divisor thats right quotient another way saying answer many times went polynomial thats polynomial long division ill see next video long division long division long division long division long division long division long division long division long division long division long division long division long division long division
