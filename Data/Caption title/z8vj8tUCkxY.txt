Lets see if we can give ourselves a little bitof practice converting between radians and degreesand degrees and radians.And just as a review lets just remind ourselves the relationshipand I always do this before I have to convert between the two.If I do one revolution of a circle how many radians is that going to be ? Well we know one revolution of a circle is ( 2 ) ( pi ) radiansand how many degrees is that if I do one revolution around a circle ? Well we know that is 360 degrees ... ..I can either write it with the little degree symbol like that or I can write it just like that.And this is really enough information for us to think abouthow to convert between radians and degreesif we want to simplify this a little bit we can divide both sidesby 2.And you can have ( pi ) radians are equal to 180 degreesor another way to think about itgoing halfway around a circle in radians is ( pi ) radians.The arc that subtends that angle is ( pi ) radiussssesand that 's also 180 degrees.And if you wan na really think about , well how many degrees are there per radianyou can divide both sides of this by ( pi ) .So if you divide both sides of this by ( pi ) , you would get one radianit would have to go from plural to singularone radian is equal to 180/pi degrees.So all I did is I divided both sides by ( pi ) and if you wanted to figure out how many radiansare there per degree you can divide both sides by 180.So you would get pi/180 radiansis equal to 1 degree.So this is ... .now I think we are ready to start converting.So lets convert 30 degrees ... .to radians.So lets think about it.I 'm going to write it out and actually this might remind you of unit analysisthat you might do when you first did unit conversionbut it also works out here.So if I were to write 30 degreesand this is how my brain likes to work with itI like to write out the word degrees.Well I wan na convert to radians so I really want to figure outhow many radians are there per degree ? So let me write this down . I wan na figure out how many radians do we have per degree ? And I have n't filled out how many that isbut we see the units will cancel outif we have degrees times radians/degreethe degrees will cancel out and I 'll be just left with radians.If I multiply the number of degrees I have times the number of radians per degreewe 're gon na get radians.And hopefully that makes intuitive sense as well.And here we just have to think aboutwell if I have ... think of it this way , if I havepi radians how many degrees is that ? Well that 's 180 degrees , comes straight out of this right over herepi radians for every 180 degrees or pi/180 radians/degree.This is going to get us to ... we 're going to get 30 times pi/18030 times pi/180which will simplify to30/180 is 1/6so this is equal to pi/6let me write the units outthis is 30 radians which is equal to pi/6 radians.Now lets go the other waylets think about if we have pi/3 radiansand I wan na convert that to degrees.So what am I going to get if I convert that to degrees ? Well here we 're gon na want to figure outhow many degrees are there per radian ? One way to think about it isthink about the pi and the 180for every 180 degrees you have pi radians.180 degrees/pi radiansthese are essentially the equivalent thingessentially you 're just multiplying this quantity by 1but you 're changing the unitsthe radians cancel out and then the pi 's cancel outand you 're left with 180/3 degrees180/3 is 60 and we can either write out the word degrees or you can write degreesjust like that.Now lets think about 45 degrees.So what about 45 degrees ? And I 'll write it like that just so you can figure it out with that notation as well.How many radians will this be equal to ? Well once again we 're gon na want to think about how many radians do we have per degree ? So we 're going to multiply this timeswell we know we have pi radiansfor every 180 degreesor we can even write it this waypi radians for every 180 degrees.And here this might be a little less intuitivethe degrees cancel out and that 's why I usually like towrite out the wordand you 're left with 45 pi/180 radians.Actually let me write this with the words written outfor me that 's more intuitive when I 'm thinking about itin terms of using the notation.So 45 degrees times , we have pi radians for every 180 degrees.So we are left with when you multiply45 times pi over 180the degrees have canceled out and you 're just left withradians.Which is equal to what ? 45 is half of 90 which is half of 180 so this is 1/4this is equal to pi over 4 radians.Lets do 1 more over here.So lets say that we had negative pi/2 radians.What 's that going to be in degrees ? Well once again we have to figure outhow many degreesare each of these radians.We know that there 180 degreesfor every pi radiansso we 're gon na getthe radians cancel outthe pi 's cancel outand so you have-180/2this is -90 degreesor we can write it as -90 degrees.Anyway hopefully you found that helpfuland I 'll do a couple more example problems herebecause the more example for thisthe better and hopefully it will becomea little bit intuitive Radian and degree conversion practice | Trigonometry | Khan Academy Radian and degree conversion practice | Trigonometry | Khan Academy Radian and degree conversion practice | Trigonometry | Khan Academy
