So we 're gon na do one of the famous puzzles that you can play with a chess board.It 's not chess , itself , but it 's a puzzle you can play.The standard 8 by 8 chess board , and queens.So a queen , if you do n't know , a queen is the strongest ; it 's the best piece on a chess board'Cause it can move any number of squares to the left and the right.It can move any number of squares up and down , and it can move diagonally as well , any number of squares.Oh ! If there 's another piece in its way , it takes it . Aha ! Gotcha ! Right , so that 's how a queen moves : diagonally , up and down , left and right.Now the puzzle is : Can you place 8 queens on a chess board so that none of the queens can attack each other ? So all of the queens are safe . So this would n't work as a placement , because we 've got one queen here that can take another.They are under attack . But maybe something like this would work just fine.Now I 've only got 2 queens here . All queens can take each other queen , so the colors do n't matter.The question is , can we place 8 queens on the board ? Can we ? Well , how many ways can we place 8 queens on the board ? First of all , how many ways are there to do that ? Let 's look at that first.Right , which does mean that we 've got 56 blanks ? I think we can do this calculation.I think even Brady can do this calculation.How many ways can we arrange 64 objects , Brady ? Brady : 64 factorial.James : Yeah , 64 factorial . If you have 64 objects , there are 64 factorial ways to do that : 64 times 63 times 62 ... all the way down to 1.So , there are 64 objects , 8 queens and 56 blanks . But you can rearrange the blanks between themselves , and it does n't change the position on the board.So , we 're going to divide by how many blanks there are : 56 factorial ways to arrange the blanks.So we have to consider that the queens are the same . I can move the queens between each other , I can commute the queens between each otherAnd it does n't affect the solution ; the positions they are on the board.So for that reason , we are also going to divide through by 8 factorial.There are 8 queens , and they can be swapped around between each other.So we 'll divide through by 8 factorial.So the number of ways you can arrange those 8 queens naively is 4,426,165,368.So there are over 4 billion ways you can place your 8 queens on the board , but that 's naively doing it.That 's not considering how the queens attack each other , so you 're going to get silly solutionsLike this one , or this , or this . These are no good ; these are n't solutions.So , how many solutions are there , out of that 4 billion figure that do work , so the queens do n't attack ? What do you think ? It is in fact only a small fraction of this 4 billion.There are 92 distinct solutions.Now that 92 out of 4 billion as a percentage is ... tiny ! Unbelievably tiny.So here is one of the solutions you could place.A queen here , I can put one here , they do n't attack each other.They 're not on the same row , they 're not on the same column , they 're not on the same diagonal.I can put a queen here . Again , not in the same row , column or diagonal.I could put one I think down here . One here . And maybe I 'll put one here.And here , and ... where shall I put it ? Here ? Yeah.And I think I got away with that . So that would work -No queens are attacking each other.Now , there are 92 distinct solutions you could have.That includes rotating the board , and reflecting the board as well.So they 're not all going to be really different . Some of them are just turning this 90 degrees.That would count as a solution . Now , there are 8 ways that you could rotate the board and reflect it.4 rotations , and 4 reflections . So , how many actual individual ways are there to do it ? There 's 12 . There 's only 12 fundamentally different solutions.11 of them have 8 reflections and rotations , which takes us up to 88.1 of them only has 4 rotations and reflectionsAnd it 's actually this one I drew . This only has 4 different solutions , because if I rotate it 180 , it 's symmetric.So that only has 4 , that has half as many . But the others have 8.So that 's 92 distinct solutions . 12 fundamentally different ones.So you can do this - you can do this with other pieces.Can you place 8 knights on the board without attacking each other ? I think that would be quite easy.Could you place 8 bishops on the board without attacking each other ? I think that 's quite an easy problem as well.Maybe 8 rooks ? Again , I think these are easier problems.Although how MANY ways you can do it - that 's a much more interesting question . How many different ways can you do it ?
