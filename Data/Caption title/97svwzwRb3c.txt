goal solve x way try isolate get radical going try get square root x plus working outside opposite operation going add sides keep equation balanced give us squared x plus want opposite multiplying going divide sides equation left square root x plus k gon na going get rid radical square root opposite thats square k sides square square root cancel one another get x plus subtract sides get x equal work radical equation sometimes get cal led extraneous root false answer however want say want make sure actually correct answer take put back original equation make sure works sometimes like said get false answer answer make sure going plus minus square root going give us thats thats going minus see equal yeah indeed correct answer sometimes happen didnt work would say theres solution sometimes solve get two answer maybe one one dozen maybe dont work maybe work want double check original equation let example b see doesnt look like radical equation like original one fact radical see denominator thats really represent ing cube root ax quantity squared gon na going work outside towards variable inverse opposite operation weve got x minus equal going sides weve got x equal going divide trying get variable weve two third equal four going going raise sides reciprocal power instead power raise three halves power like see power power multiply going give x first wan ted x remember denominator root saying square root four numerator power thats raised third power square root cube dis times times e going answer problem let go ahead put back double check cube root squared minus remember denominator root numerator power work radical equation show solve gon na another video getting check interested subscribe channel check math tube math tutor ing look forward seeing future video radical equation radical equation radical equation radical equation radical equation radical equation radical equation radical equation radical equation radical equation radical equation radical equation radical equation radical equation radical equation
