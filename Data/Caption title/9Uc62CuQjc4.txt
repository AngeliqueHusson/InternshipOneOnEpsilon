Hi , I¡¯m Rob . Welcome to Math Antics ! In this lesson , we¡¯re gon na learn something that¡¯s an important foundation for tons of math problems , including those you¡¯ll encounter while learning basic Algebra.We¡¯re gon na learn about graphing , which basically means taking mathematical relationships and turning them into pictures.Hey Friends , welcome back to The Joy of Graphing.We¡¯re gon na pick up right where we left off.We already have this nice , beautiful function right here.But it needs a friend.And we¡¯re gon na do that by adding some points.So let¡¯s put the next point right here.Now all we need to do is connect those points¡­cuz they¡¯re all friends.And what to friends do ? They stay connected.Oh and look at that¡­That¡¯s beautiful.Well , not the kind of picture that you¡¯d hang on your wall.Graphing just means making a visual representation of an equation or data set so you can understand it better.It¡¯s a way of helping you literally SEE how math works.When math is just a bunch of numbers and symbols on a page , it can be pretty abstract and hard to relate to.But graphing is like a window into the abstract world of math that helps us see it more clearly.In fact , the focus of our lesson today actually looks a bit like a window.¡­and it¡¯s called ¡°The Coordinate Plane¡±.The coordinate plane is the platform or stage that our graphing will take place on.But to understand how it works , we first need to start with its closest relative ; The Number Line.You remember how a number line works , right ? A number line starts at zero , and represents positive numbers as you move to the rightand negative numbers as you more to the left.And there¡¯s usually marks showing where each integer is along the way.Now imagine cloning that number line and rotating the copy counter-clockwise by 90 degreesso that the second number line is perpendicular to the first and they intersect at their zero points.What we have now is a ¡°number plane¡± . It¡¯s basically like a 2-Dimensional version of a number line , but that second dimension makes it much more useful.With a simple 1-Dimensional number line , we could show where various numbers were located along that line by drawing ( or plotting ) points.But no matter how many points we plot , they¡¯re always on the same line.But with a 2-Dimensional number plane , we can plot points anywhere in that 2D area , and that opens up a whole new world of possibilities.With a 1-Dimensional number line , plotting points was easy.You just needed one number to tell you where to plot a point.But with a 2-Dimensional number plane , you actually need TWO numbers to plot each point.These two numbers are called ¡°coordinates¡± because they¡¯re the same ¡®rank¡¯ or ¡®order¡¯and they work together to specify the locations of a point on the number plane.In fact , that¡¯s why the number plane is often referred to as the ¡°coordinate plane¡±.It¡¯s the stage for plotting coordinates.Coordinates use a special format to help you recognize them.The two numbers are put inside parentheses with a comma between them as a separator.So when you see 2 comma 5or negative 7 comma 3or 0 comma 1.5you know you¡¯re dealing with coordinates.Okay , to understand how coordinates work , remember that our number plane is formed by combining two perpendicular number lines.From now on , we¡¯re going to refer to each one of these number lines as an ¡°axis¡±.One of the axes is horizontal ( like the horizon ) which means the other axis is vertical ( or straight up and down ) .And they¡¯re often called the ¡°horizontal¡± and ¡°vertical¡± axes because of that.But even more often , the axes are referred to by variable-based names.The horizontal axis is called ¡°the X-axis¡± and the vertical axis is called ¡°the Y-Axis¡±.Why use variable names ? Well there¡¯s two good reasons.The first is that variable names are more flexible than horizontal and vertical , which relate to a specific orientation in space that may not always be relevant.And the second reason is that each of the two coordinate numbers is actually a variablethat relates to a specific position along one of the two axes of the coordinate plane.And since those variables are usually called ¡®X¡¯ and ¡®Y¡¯ , it makes sense to name the two axes the same way.The first coordinate number listed will be called ¡®X¡¯and the second coordinate number listed will be called ¡®Y¡¯.And we¡¯re always going to list the numbers in that same order , ¡¯X¡¯ first and then ¡®Y¡¯ , so that we never get confused about which is which.In fact , coordinates are often called ¡°ordered pairs¡± becausethey¡¯re a pair of numbers that are always listed in the same order : ¡®X¡¯ value first¡­ ¡®Y¡¯ value second.So if you have the coordinates , ( 3 , 5 ) that means X = 3 and Y = 5.Pretty easy , right ? But now how do we actually plot these coordinates ( or ordered pairs ) on the coordinate plane ? Well , the first number in the ordered pair tells you where along the X-Axis the point is located , and the second number in the ordered pair tells you where along the Y-Axis the point is located.The two numbers in an ordered pair work together to define a single point , and each one of the numbers only gives you half of the information about where that point is.To see how this works , let¡¯s plot the coordinates ( 3 , 2 ) First , we locate the X value along the X-axis , which is at 3 in this case.But instead of putting a point there , we draw ( or just imagine ) a line perpendicular to the X-axis that goes through the 3.We do that because the first number in the ordered pair only tells us where along the X-axis the point is , but it could be ANYWHERE along the Y-axis.We won¡¯t know that until we plot the second number.So temporarily , we just draw a line there to represent every possible point that could have an X value of 3.Next , we locate the Y value along the Y-axis , which is at 2 in this case.But again , instead of putting a point there , we draw ( or just imagine ) a line perpendicular to the Y-axis that goes through the 2.We do that because the second number in the ordered pair only tells us where along the Y-axis the point is , but it could be ANYWHERE along the X-axis.So we just draw a line there to represent every possible point that could have a Y value of ¡®2¡¯Ah , but look what we¡¯ve got now.The first line represents all the possible locations where X equals 3.And the second line represents all the possible locations where Y equals 2.And the exact point where the two lines intersect representsthe only point in the entire coordinate plane where both X = 3 and Y = 2.That intersections is the location of our point.Pretty cool , huh ? And that¡¯s a really good way to understand how the coordinate plane works.But I want to show you an even easier ( and more intuitive ) way to actually plot points.This more intuitive way involves starting with a point at the origin of the coordinate planeand then treating the coordinates like a set of simple instructionsthat tell you how far to move your point in the X and Y directions.For example , to plot the coordinates ( 3 , 2 ) like before , we start by imagining a point at the origin ( 0 , 0 ) Then , we look at the first number in our ordered pair to see how far we need to move our point in the X direction.Since X is positive 3 , we move our point a distance of 3 units in the positive X direction.And then from there , since Y is positive 2 , we move our point a distance of 2 units in the positive Y direction.So that¡¯s a pretty easy method for plotting points ! Let¡¯s try it a few more times so you get the idea.Let¡¯s plot the coordinates ( -4 , 3 ) .Again , we start by imagining a point at the originand then let the coordinates tell us how far to move it along the X and Y axes.Since X is negative 4 , we move the point a distance of 4 units , but this time in the negative X direction which is to the left.And then , since Y is positive 3 , we move the point a distance of 3 units in the positive Y direction.Now let¡¯s plot the coordinates ( -3 , -3 ) .In this case , X and Y are both negative , so starting with a point at ( 0 , 0 ) we move it 3 units in the negative X direction , and then 3 units in the negative Y direction.And last , let¡¯s plot the coordinates ( 4 , -2.5 ) .Starting at ( 0 , 0 ) we move the point 4 units in the positive X directionand then 2 and 1/2 units in the negative Y direction.Okay , so we¡¯ve plotted four ordered pairs the easy way , and did you notice that each of these points is located in a different region of the coordinate place.These four regions are called ¡°Quadrants¡± and their boundaries are defined by the two axes of the coordinate plane.The quadrants are named 1 through 4 so we can easily refer to them in conversations if we need to.Quadrant 1 is the upper right quadrant , and it contains all of the points where both the X and Y values are positive.Quadrant 2 is the upper left , and it contains all of the points that have a negative X value and a positive Y value.Quadrant 3 is the lower left , and it contains all of the points that have both a negative X and a negative Y value.And Quadrant 4 is the lower right , and it contains all of the points that have a positive X value and a negative Y value.Roman Numerals are usually used to label the four quadrantsand they¡¯re in that order because that¡¯s the order you would encounter the quadrantsif you started with a line segment from the origin to the coordinate ( 1,0 ) and then rotated that line counter-clockwise around the origin.Doing this sweeps out a shape called a ¡°unit circle¡±which is divided into four quadrants just like the coordinate plane.Alright , so now you know what the coordinate plane is , and you know how to plot points on it.But you might be wondering , ¡°What has this got to do with basic Algebra ? ¡±Well , Algebra involves many different types of equations and functions that are a lot easier to understandif we graph their solutions on the coordinate plane.And as you know , the way to really get good at math is to practice what you¡¯ve learned by doing some exercise problems.Thanks for watching Math Antics , and I¡¯ll see ya next time.Ohh¡­ ohhhh¡­ [ snickering ] [ sarcastically ] Ah¡­ exactly what I wanted.Learn more at www.mathantics.com Algebra Basics: Graphing On The Coordinate Plane - Math Antics Algebra Basics: Graphing On The Coordinate Plane - Math Antics Algebra Basics: Graphing On The Coordinate Plane - Math Antics
