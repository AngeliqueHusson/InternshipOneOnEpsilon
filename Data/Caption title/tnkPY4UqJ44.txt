Divide and write the answer as a mixed number.And we have 3/5 divided by 1/2.Now , whenever you 're dividing any fractions , you just haveto remember that dividing by a fraction is the same thing asmultiplying by its reciprocal.So this thing right here is the same thing as 3/5 times -- so this is our 3/5 right here , and instead of a divisionsign , you want a multiplication sign , andinstead of a 1/2 , you want to take the reciprocal of 1/2 , which would be 2/1 -- so times 2/1.So dividing by 1/2 is the exact same thing asmultiplying by 2/1.And we just do this as a straightforward multiplicationproblem now.3 times 2 is 6 , so our new numerator is 6.5 times 1 is 5.So 3/5 divided by 1/2 as an improper fraction is 6/5.Now , they want us to write it as at mixed number.So we divide the 5 into the 6 , figure out howmany times it goes.That 'll be the whole number part of the mixed number.And then whatever 's left over will be the remainingnumerator over 5.So what we 'll do is take 5 into 6.5 goes into 6 one time.1 times 5 is 5.Subtract.You have a remainder of 1.So 6/5 is equal to one whole , or 5/5 , and 1/5.This 1 comes from whatever is left over.And now we 're done ! 3/5 divided by 1/2 is 1 and 1/5.Now , the one thing that 's not obvious is why did this work ? Why is dividing by 1/2 the same thing as multiplyingessentially by 2.2/1 is the same thing as 2.And to do that , I 'll do a little side -- fairly simple -- example , but hopefully , it gets the point across.Let me take four objects.So we have four objects : one , two , three , four.So I have four objects , and if I were to divide into groupsof two , so I want to divide it into groups of two.So that is one group of two and then that is another groupof two , how many groups do I have ? Well , 4 divided by 2 , I have two groups of two , so that isequal to 2.Now , what if I took those same four objects : one , two , three , four.So I 'm taking those same four objects.Instead of dividing them into groups of two , I want todivide them into groups of 1/2 , which means each groupwill have half of an object in it.So let 's say that would be one group right there.That is a second group.That is a third group.I think you see each group has half of a circle in it.That is the fourth.That 's the fifth.That 's the sixth.That 's the seventh , and then that 's the eighth.You have eight groups of 1/2 , so this is equal to 8.And notice , now each of the objects became two groups.So you could say how many groups do you have ? Well , you have four objects and each ofthem became two groups.I 'm looking for a different color.Each of them became two groups , and soyou also have eight.So dividing by 1/2 is the same thing as multiplying by 2.And you could think about it with other numbers , buthopefully , that gives you a little bit of an intuition .
