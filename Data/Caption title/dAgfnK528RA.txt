Hi and welcome to Math Antics . Today weâ€™re gon na talk about an important math concept called Order of Operations . Order of Operations is just a set of math rules that tell you which math operations ( like addition or multiplication ) to do first . Now you might be wondering ( especially if youâ€™re a teenager ) , â€œWhy do I need RULES to tell me which operations to do first ? Canâ€™t I just do them in any order I want ? â€ Well , thatâ€™s a really good questions ! And to answer it , weâ€™re going to give two TOTALLY different people the SAME math problem to solve . The problem is : 2 + 5 Ã— 4 Hmmmâ€¦ I like addition better than multiplication , so Iâ€™m gon na do that first ! Letâ€™s seeâ€¦ 2 + 5 gives us 7 . And then I just multiply that 7 by the 4 and I get 28 . That was easy ! But youâ€™d better not copy my answer ! Uh , donâ€™t worryâ€¦ Iâ€™m not gon na copy your answer , cuz I want the RIGHT answer ! And I prefer multiplying , so Iâ€™m going to do THAT first . Letâ€™s seeâ€¦ 4 Ã— 5 = 20 , and THEN Iâ€™ll add the 2 which gives me 22 for a final answer . What makes you think THATâ€™S the right answer ? All my calculations were correct . I even checked it with a calculator ! Pfffff - the only calculator I need is right up here ! And the correct answer isâ€¦ boop , boop , boop boop , boopâ€¦ . 22 ! Okay , so which one of these guys do you think is right ? Neither one made any mistakes with the calculations . They just did the operations in a different order and got DIFFERENT answers ! Wellâ€¦ since there were no mistakes , in a way , they were BOTH right ! But math would be a VERY confusing subject if there were different answers to the same problem . And thatâ€™s where Order of Operations can help us out . The Order of Operations Rules are a way for us all to agree on the order that you should do math operations in . And if we always do operations in the same order , then weâ€™ll always get the same answer . So now that you know WHY we need Order of Operations rules , letâ€™s find out what those rules are . Thereâ€™re basically four of them and they go something like this : FIRST : do operation in parentheses and brackets NEXT : do exponents THEN : do multiplication and division LAST : do addition and subtraction Letâ€™s take a closer look at each one of these rules , and see some examples where they will help us . First on the list was : do operations in parentheses and brackets . Now in case you havenâ€™t seen parentheses or brackets used in math before , let me briefly explain how they work . Parentheses are just these symbols that curve forwards and backwards , and theyâ€™re used in pairs like this . And when we put numbers and operators in between them , it forms a group . Itâ€™s almost like the parentheses form a package to hold whatever math stuff we put inside them . And brackets work exactly the same way as parentheses . They just have a different shape that looks a little more boxy , but they mean exactly the same thing . So parentheses and brackets are used to group things together , and our rules tell us to do any operations inside these groups FIRST . For example , have a look at this problem : 10 Ã— ( 4 + 5 ) It has 3 numbers and 2 operations : multiplication and addition . But 2 of the numbers and the addition symbol are inside parentheses . That means that they form a group and we need to do that part of the problem first . 4 + 5 = 9 , so the part inside the parentheses can just be replaced with the simplified value 9 . Ohâ€¦ and once you do the math thatâ€™s inside parentheses and get a single number like this , you usually donâ€™t need to show the parentheses anymore . Now that the parentheses are gone , we just have one operation left to do . We multiply 10 Ã— 9 and that gives us 90 as our final answer . So parentheses can really help you know what part of a problem youâ€™re supposed to do first . But what if you get a problem that has more than one set of parentheses , like this : ( 5 âˆ ’ 3 ) + ( 6 Ã— 2 ) Fortunately , it doesnâ€™t matter which set of parentheses you do first . You just need to do everything thatâ€™s inside the parentheses BEFORE you do anything that 's NOT inside parentheses . In other words , we need to simplify BOTH of our parentheses groups before we can do this addition IN-BETWEEN them . The first group ( 5 âˆ ’ 3 ) simplifies to 2 , and the second group ( 6 Ã— 2 ) simplifies to 12 . Now we can do the last operation and add the values that we got from simplifying : 2 + 12 = 14 Okay , now that we know we always do operation in parentheses or brackets FIRST , letâ€™s take a closer look at the second rule that says the next thing we do is exponents . Now if you havenâ€™t seen exponents before , theyâ€™re just a way of writing repeated multiplication . For example , the repeated multiplication 4 Ã— 4 can be written in a shorter form as 4 multiplied twice . And 4 Ã— 4 Ã— 4 can be written as 4 multiplied 3 times , and 4 Ã— 4 Ã— 4 Ã— 4 can be written as 4 multiplied 4 times . â€¦get the idea ? This small number is called an exponent ( or power ) . It just tells you how many times to multiply the bigger number together . So after we take care of any parentheses , simplifying any exponents becomes the next highest priority . For example in this problem , we have to simplify the exponent BEFORE we can do the other multiplication . The exponent is telling us to multiply 5 together twice . So 5 times 5 is 25 . And after we do that , THEN we multiply the result by 3 . So 25 times 3 is 75 . Oh , and one thing I should point outâ€¦ sometimes youâ€™ll get a problem that has exponents inside of parentheses , like this problem . And you may wonder , â€œHow can I get rid of the parentheses BEFORE I do the exponent ? â€ You might think that if you simplify the exponent first , youâ€™re breaking the rules . But the truth is that by doing whatever operations are inside the parentheses , you ARE doing the parentheses first . The parentheses really just tell you where to start . So in this problem , first we do 3 to the power of 2 , which means 3 Ã— 3 which is 9 . Then the part inside the parentheses is 9 Ã— 4 , which equals 36 . And once the parentheses are gone , we add 36 + 6 and get 42 as our final answer . Alright , now weâ€™re gon na look at the last two rules together . These two rules are really important because they deal with the most common math operations : addition , subtraction , multiplication & division . And the rules tell us that we need to do multiplication and division BEFORE we do addition and subtraction . To see how these rules work , lets look at a few quick examples that use those basic operations . First letâ€™t try this one : 2 + 5 + 4 Ah Ha ! â€¦ Does this look familiar ? Yep , itâ€™s the one we gave to my two friends earlier . And now that we have our rules , we see that we have to do the multiplication before the addition . 5 Ã— 4 = 20 and THEN we add the 2 , which gives us 22â€¦ so the second guy WAS right ! [ Sarcastically ] What a surprise ! Now letâ€™s try this one : 3 Ã— 5 âˆ ’ 1 Our rules tell us that multiplication is higher on the list than subtraction , so we do 3 Ã— 5 first . That gives us 15 , and THEN we subtract the â€˜1â€™ which leaves 14 as our final answer . Hereâ€™s one with division and subtraction : 20 âˆ ’ 10 Ã· 5 And since division has a higher priority , we do the 10 divided by 5 first , which equals 2 . And then we subtract 2 from 20 and get 18 as our final answer . And hereâ€™s another problem : 12 Ã· 6 + 5 Again , our rules say to do the division before addition , so 12 divided by 6 equals 2 and then we add the 5 to get 7 . And hereâ€™s one last problem : 40 Ã· 4 Ã— 5 Which do we do first ? â€¦ the multiplication or the division ? Our rules donâ€™t tell us . Well , thatâ€™s because multiplication and division are TIED for priority or importance . So are addition and subtraction . And THATâ€™S the reason we need an extra part at the end of each of these rule that says â€œfrom left to rightâ€ If you have a problem that has BOTH multiplication AND division , then youâ€™re supposed to work it from left to right . Thatâ€™s because in some cases , you can get a different answers if you go from right to left . For example , in this problem , if you work from right to left ( the wrong way ) you would do the 4 Ã— 5 first and get 20 . And then 40 divided by 20 equals 2 . But if you go from left to right , you would do 40 divided by 4 first , which is 10 , and then 10 times 5 equals 50 . Wow ! The direction we went made a BIG difference . So whenever you have a problem that has a mixture of multiplication and division OR a mixture of addition and subtraction , you know to do the operations in order from left to right . Alright , weâ€™re just about done , but letâ€™s have one more look at all four of our rules before you start practicing with the exercises . The Order of Operations rules say : FIRST : do operation in parentheses and brackets NEXT : do exponents THEN : do multiplication and division ( from left to right ) LAST : do addition and subtraction ( from left to right ) Alright , that does it for this video . Good luck with the exercises and Iâ€™ll see ya next time . Learn more at www.mathantics.com Math Antics - Order Of Operations Math Antics - Order Of Operations Math Antics - Order Of Operations
