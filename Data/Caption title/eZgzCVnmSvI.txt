hello and welcome this example I want toshow you how to find the slant asymptotefor a rational function now one thingthat might go through your mind is howdo you know this does have a slantasymptote well one way you can tellwhether it does have a slant is actuallycompare the largest power in the topwith the largest power in the bottom nowif the power on top is exactly 1 largerthan the bottom then you know it musthave a slant asymptote so as you can seein this example the largest power on thetop is 3 versus the largest power on thebottom which is 2 so the top is exactly1 larger than the bottom so actuallyfind that slant asymptote we go throughthe long division process and basicallyrecord our quotient so I 'm going to takea 4x cubed plus a 0 x squared plus a 0 Xminus 5 so that represents our toppolynomial I 'm going to divide this by 2x squared plus 0 X minus 6 now you'llnotice that I 'm putting in some zeroplaceholders for some of my missingpowers of X this is a good idea just tomake sure that everything lines upcorrectlyalright now let 's actually go throughthis division process so 2x squaredtimes what would equal a 4x cubed well 2x squared will do it as 2 x squaredtimes the 2 X will give me a 4x cubedperfect now we 'll multiply by the otherterms and subtract away that newpolynomial down here so 2x times 0 so 0x squared 2x times a minus 6 minus 12xlooks good now that we have that downthere we want to subtract it away seewhat this gives us so 4x cubed minus 4xcubed will be gone zero minus zero gonelooks like this is a zero minus anegative 12 I 'll become a positive 12Thanks all right that looks pretty goodnow at this point the power is now lessthan what I 'm dividing it by so thispolynomial down here represents myremainder now what this is reallyshowing me is that when I run throughthe division process I get a 2x plus myremainder which is still being dividedby the 2x squared minus 6now this quotient part that we got the2x this is where the slant asymptote isgoing to come from in fact I could saythat the equation for this land is yequals 2x and there you goso always look for the quotient whenlooking for that slant asymptote ifyou 'd like to see some more videosplease visit mysecretmathtutor.com Pre-Calculus - How to find the slant asymptote of a rational function Pre-Calculus - How to find the slant asymptote of a rational function Pre-Calculus - How to find the slant asymptote of a rational function
