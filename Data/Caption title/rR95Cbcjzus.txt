Hi and welcome to Math Antics.In today¡¯s video , we¡¯re gon na learn how to do one of the most common calculations with percentages.We¡¯re gon na learn how to find a percent of a number.But what does that even mean ? Do numbers have percents that they hide somewhere and then we have to go looking for them like a game of hide and seek ? Gottch ya ! Umm - not exactly.Finding a percent of a number makes more sense if you remember that a number just represents an amount and that a percent is really just a fraction.So finding a percent of a number really means finding a fraction of an amount.Think about it this way¡­Let¡¯s say the number 20 represents an amount , like the amount of lady bugs that you found at the park one day.And let¡¯s also imagine that you agreed to give 25 % of all the lady bugs you found to your little sister.Okay then , so how many is that ? If you have 20 lady bugs , how many is 25 % of that amount ? That¡¯s what it means to find a percent of a number.You¡¯re finding out how much that percent ( or fraction ) of the total is.In this case , since our total is 20 , we need to know what 25 % of 20 is.So how do we figure that out ? Well , it¡¯s really easy if you remember back to one of our fractions videos ; the one about multiplying fractions.In that video , we learned that when dealing with fractions , sometimes the word ¡°of¡± is used instead of the multiplication symbol.When they say find 1/2 of 16 , they really mean find 1/2 times 16.Well guess what¡­Since a percent is just a special fraction¡­ ¡°of¡± means the exact same thing with percents that it did with fractions.When we have 25 % of 20 , that means the same as 25 % times 20.Great ! So all we have to do to find a percent of a number is to multiply.But how do we multiply a percent and a number together ? Do we just forget about the percent sign and multiply the numbers together ? No ! If we did it that way , our answer would be WAY too big.25 % should be a smaller part ( or fraction ) of 20 lady bugs.But if we did 25 times 20 , we¡¯d get 500 lady bugs ! ! Clearly that¡¯s not the right answer ! Here¡¯s what we have to do instead ... Remember that when you see a percent written like this with the percent sign , it¡¯s an abbreviation for a fraction ; in this case , 25 over 100.So we need to use that fraction form when we multiply since we¡¯re really multiplying by a fraction.Now some of you may also remember that percents have a decimal form . We¡¯ll get to that in just a minute.Okay then , if we use the fraction form of our percent , then our problem becomes : 25/100 times 20.Now that¡¯s a problem we know how to do.To multiply fractions , we just multiply the top numbers , and then we multiply the bottom numbers to get the answer.And we can just write 20 as a fraction by putting a 1 as the bottom number , because 20 over 1 is the exact same value as 20.So , let¡¯s go ahead and multiply.On the top , we have 25 ¡Á 20 which gives us 500.And on the bottom , we have 100 ¡Á 1 which is just 100.So our answer is 500 over 100.Now 500 over 100 might seem like a strange answer , but that¡¯s just because we still need to simplify it.500 over 100 simplifies to 5 over 1 , and 5 over 1 is just 5.That¡¯s much better . So , 25 % of 20 is 5.Alright , so to find a percent of a number , we just need to multiply the fraction form of the percent by the number and we have our answer.But , there¡¯s another slightly different method that you can use that works especially well if you¡¯re allowed to use a calculator.In our first percentages video , we learned that percents have both a fraction form and a decimal form.We¡¯ve already seen how we can use the fraction form to find a percent of a number , but we can also use the decimal form if we want to instead.The procedure starts the same . If you need to find 25 % of 20 , you first replace the word ¡°of¡± with the multiplication symbol.Next , we¡¯ll replace the percent , but with its decimal form this time . 25 % is the same as the decimal 0.25Then , all we have to do is multiply.And although I could easily do the decimal multiplication by hand , I happen to have a calculator , so I¡¯m gon na use it.I just enter 0.25 ¡Á 20 , hit equals , and I get 5.Yep - That¡¯s the same answer we got when we used the fraction form of 25 % . Oh Yeah ! So that¡¯s how you find a percent of a number . You just multiply the number by either the fraction form OR the decimal form of the percent.Either way will give you the right answer , so you can choose whichever will be easier for you to do.Let¡¯s see a couple more examples before you practice on your own.This next one involves money.Pretend that your best friend has a job walking dogs and offers to give you 35 % of whatever he earns if you help walk some of the dogs.If your friend earns $ 80 that week , how much of the money will you get ? In other words , you need to figure out what 35 % of 80 is.Okay then , let¡¯s start by replacing the ¡°of¡± with the times symbol.And next we have to decide if we want to replace the percent with its fraction form or its decimal form.I think I¡¯ll use the decimal form for this one which means I 'll replace the 35 % with 0.35Now , all we have to do is multiply 0.35 times 80 , and that¡¯s 28.That means you¡¯ll get 28 dollars if you help your friend walk those dog.Cha-ching ! Okay then¡­ In the last two problems , we found a percent of a number , which , like we learned at the beginning of the video , just means finding a fraction of an amount.And like you¡¯d expect when finding a fraction of something , the answer was smaller than the amount we started with.But remember , fractions can be ¡®improper¡¯ too which means that their value is greater than 1.And in the same way , percents can be greater than 100 % . So you might come across situations like this¡­Suppose that last year , your school had 400 students , but this year it has 120 % of that amount.Well , 100 % would mean the exact same number of students as last year , so 120 % must mean that there¡¯s more students now , but how many students ? To find out , we need to calculate what 120 % of 400 is.Great , we know just how to do that.We just multiply 400 by the fraction form OR the decimal form of 120 % .Let¡¯s use the decimal form again.To get the decimal form of 120 % , we move the decimal point over 2 places to the left , and we get 1.20So we multiply 1.20 times 400 which gives us 480.So this year there¡¯s 480 students at school.Alright then , that¡¯s how you find the percent of a number.And it¡¯s a really useful math skill that has a LOT of real-life applications so it¡¯s important to learn how to do it right.As always , the best way to learn math is to practice on your own.Thanks for watching Math Antics , and I¡¯ll see ya next time.Learn more at www.mathantics.com Math Antics - Finding A Percent Of A Number Math Antics - Finding A Percent Of A Number Math Antics - Finding A Percent Of A Number
