Hi ! Welcome to Math Antics.In this video , we¡¯re gon na learn how to do another common type of problem involving percents.We¡¯re gon na learn how to figure out , ¡°What percent is it ? ¡±In our last video , we learned how to do a really common percent problem which was finding a percent of a number.For example , we learned how you could solve a problem like , ¡°What is 20 % of 50 ? ¡± And the answer to that problem is 10.So we could say that , ¡°10 is 20 % of 50¡±Let¡¯s look closely at that statement for a minute.Notice that there¡¯s three different numbers in it : 10 , 20 and 50.That¡¯s because a percentage is really a relationship between 3 numbers.Well , actually it¡¯s a relationship between 4 numbers , but the forth number is always 100 , so you always know it.To see what I mean , think back to our video about percents and equivalent fractions.In that video , we learned that a percent is really an equivalent fraction that has 100 as the bottom number.So we could rewrite our statement like this : 10 over 50 equals 20 over 100.This is exactly the same as saying that 10 is 20 PER-CENT of 50.So these are the four components of a percent problem.But since we know that 100 is always gon na be the bottom number of this equivalent fraction ( the percent ) we can just rewrite it using the percent symbol.That way we can focus on the other three numbers that can change.And we¡¯re gon na give each one of these three numbers a name so that we don¡¯t get confused.We¡¯re gon na call the top number of the fraction , ¡°the part we have¡¯¡± or just the ¡°part¡± for short.And we¡¯re gon na call the bottom number the ¡°total¡± , and we¡¯re gon na call the number in front of the percent sign the ¡°percent¡¯¡± ( or percentage ) .And since there¡¯s three different numbers that can change in a percentage problem , that means there¡¯s three different questions that you can ask.To see these three questions let¡¯s rewrite our original statement ( 10 is 20 % of 50 ) three different times.But in the first statement , we replace the ¡®10¡¯ with ¡®what¡¯ and it becomes , ¡°what is 20 % of 50¡±In the second statement , we replace the ¡¯20¡¯ with ¡®what¡¯ and it becomes , ¡°10 is what % of 50¡±.And in the third statement , we replace the ¡¯50¡¯ with ¡®what¡¯ and it becomes , ¡°10 is 20 % of what ? ¡±Doing this is helpful because , whenever you 're given a problem involving percents , the first thing you need to figure out is WHAT the problem is asking you to find ... .ya know¡­ which number is missing ? In the first statement , the ¡®part we have¡¯ is missing.In the second statement , the ¡®percent¡¯ is missing.And in the third statement , the ¡®total¡¯ is missing.And these three statements represent the three most common types of percentage problems.The first type is what we learned in the last video , ¡°Finding a Percent of a Number¡±.In this type of problem , we know the percent and we know the total , but we don¡¯t know what part of that total we have.The second type of problem is what we¡¯re gon na learn in this video.In this type of problem , we know both the total , and we know what part of that total we have.But we need to figure out what percentage of the total that part is.We need to find , ¡°What percent is it ? ¡±And the third type of problem is what we¡¯ll learn in the next video.For that type of problem , we know what part we have and we know what percent of the total it is.We just don¡¯t know the total itself.Have I lost you yet ? Don¡¯t worry - it¡¯ll make a lot more sense after we look at a few examples.So , let¡¯s look at an example of a ¡°type 2¡± problem , where we know the part we have and we know the total , but we don¡¯t know what the percent is.This example is a word problem and it says : Your uncle , who really likes to travel , has visited 35 of the 50 U.S. states.What percent of the states has he visited ? The key words in this problem are , ¡°what percent¡± because they let us know that it¡¯s the percent that¡¯s missing.So the two numbers that it gives us must be the ¡®total¡¯ , and the ¡®part we have¡¯.Well¡­ in this case , it¡¯s not really the part we have¡­ it¡¯s the part that our uncle has visited , but you get the idea.And sometimes it can be hard to tell which number the total is.Often it¡¯s the bigger number , but not always.And that¡¯s where the word ¡®¡°of¡± can help us out.The word ¡°of¡± usually goes in front of the number that¡¯s the total.So when you see ¡°¡­OF the 50 US states¡± , it¡¯s a clue that 50 is the total.Alright then , so we put 50 on the bottom of the fraction and 35 on top.Now we¡¯re ready to figure out the part we don¡¯t know ; the percent.To find the percent , all we need to do is convert the fraction into its percent form.That means we need to convert it into an equivalent fraction that has 100 as the bottom number.Well , one way we could do that would be to look for a number that we couldmultiply both the top and bottom numbers by that would change the bottom number into 100.Well the number 2 looks like it would work.If we multiply the bottom by 2 ( 2 ¡Á 50 gives us 100 ) and then we also need to multiply the top by 2 ( and 2 ¡Á 35 = 70 ) .So now we can see that 70 over 100 is equivalent to 35 over 50 , and since 70 over 100 is just 70 % it means our uncle has visited 70 % of the states.And all I got was this lousy tee-shirt.Alright , that way of finding a percent seems pretty easy.You just write the numbers that you know as a fraction , and then convert that fraction into an equivalent fraction with 100 as the bottom number.And that tells you what percent it is.The trouble is , that way is only easy if it¡¯s easy to change the bottom number into 100.For example , what if instead of 50 , you had 80 as the bottom number ? What could you multiply 80 by to get 100 ? Well , that¡¯s not as easy to figure out.So , even though finding an equivalent fraction is sometimes a good way to convert a fraction into a percent form , I¡¯m gon na show you another way that I think is even better.This second way is based on the fact that a fraction is just a division problemwhere the top number is divided by the bottom number.If you do the division , you¡¯ll end up with the decimal value of the fraction.And as we saw in our first video about percents , it¡¯s easy to convert from a decimal value into a percent.You just move the decimal point two places to the right , which is the same as multiplying by 100.The only drawback to finding the percent this way is that it involves division , and division can sometimes be tricky if you don¡¯t have a calculator.But if you do have a calculator , or if you¡¯re really good at long division , then this way works best.To see this way in action , let¡¯s try this word problem : Your Aunt has baked 80 cookies , and ( because she¡¯s a very nice Aunt ) she gave you 28 to take home with you.What percent of the cookies did she give you ? Okay , so we know that the total is 80 , and that the part we got was 28.That means that our fraction will be 28 over 80.Using our calculator , we enter 28 divided by 80 and we get 0.35 That¡¯s the decimal form of the fraction.And now , to go from the decimal form to a percent , we just move the decimal two places to the right . That gives us 35.So , when our Aunt gave us 28 out of the 80 cookies , she gave us 35 % of the cookies that she baked.Mmmm¡­ mmm¡­.. Oh ! Alright , so¡­ That¡¯s how you find out ¡°What percent is it ? ¡±You make a fraction from the part you have and from the total , and then you convert that fraction into its percent form , either by figuring out what the equivalent fraction would beor by just dividing to get the decimal value and turning that into a percent.Now , this was kind of a complicated lesson , so don¡¯t worry if you 're still a little confused.There¡¯s two things that you can do that will help make it clearer.First , you can re-watch the video to catch anything you might have missed the first time through.And second , you can practice using the procedures on your own , which will really help you understand them better.Good luck , and as always , thanks for watching Math Antics and I¡¯ll see ya next time !
