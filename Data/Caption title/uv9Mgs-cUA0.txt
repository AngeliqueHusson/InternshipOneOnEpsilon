welcome let 's start with a classiclittle puzzle the jug filling puzzlesuppose you 're given two containers athree gallon bucket and a five gallonbucket and these Packers have absolutelyno markings on them so you ca n't tellwhere the bank monk Anunnaki is to gomarkers and so forth but all you know isthe volume in the first is exactly threegallonsfollowing the second exactly fivegallons and from a will you have to usethese two buckets to obtain exactly onegallon of water how would you do it wellit does n't take much thought to thinkthrough a process but here 's onepossible answer first of all you couldsay throughout the three Yellin truckfrom the world you know you have exactlythree gallons of water there salt depictit this way then transfer that threegallons into the five gallon jug sohere 's no gallons of water in the threegallon joke but still have three gallonsof water in the five gallon jug nowinteresting thing here says there 's twogallons of space left in that fivegallon jug and we know that exactlylet 's use it to our advantage let 's fillup the three-gallon jug again so threegallons of water and another threegallons of water and transfer the whatwe can with the three gallon jug intothat space that we 'll leave behindexactly one gallon of water this islooking good technically I have sixgallons of water my position right nowwhat I 'm going to do now is empty thefive gallon jug and I 'm a second offunding way that 's an t fill the fivegallon jug so one can of water heresilicones water at the total of onegallon water in my possession so what dowe do here we filled up the onethree-gallon jug once we 've filled it upagain over here and there any otheraction with the world 's we ant I filledthe 5-gallon jug every in between stagesis transformed firming transferringwater between the jugs so I really didhere is filled at the three gallon jugstwice they gave us six gallons in totaland we emptied the five gallon jug oncethat gave us one gallon of water left soreally this jug filling problem wasreally another rithmetic problem it'sdisguise or really looking for somecombination of threes and fives thatgives the answer one and we use thiscombination two times three plusnegative one times five is one gallonbut there are other answers as well halfexample I bet IQstwo gallons a two type of the five jugtwice and I could ante fill that isempty the three gallon jug thrice checkdraw a sequence of diagrams showing howyou would actually fill out the fivegallon jug to usto a ward between the jokes and empty ofthe three-gallon jug three times and getone gallon of water in the end butthere 's a whole host of solutions tothis drug filling problem now the reasonI titled this topic the includingalgorithm and jug filling is that I cangive you more complicated numbers butyou mr. Euclid way back in the day ofhis famous a text the elements talkedabout how to solve rithmetic problems ofthis type in general but as you'recreating an algorithm so I 'm a video onthat including algorithm um and I likejust briefly remind us how it works butthe details are in that video exampleit 's take the numbers 3 & 5 hisalgorithm says just subtract the smallernumber from the larger which case 5 isthe larger subtract 3/4 gives me toleave the smaller number the same andrepeat that process subtract the smallernumber from the larger that leaves meone there two up there arm stretch smallnone from the larger one and one andstop this process when you get toidentical numbers and then Euclideanalgorithm claims that the greatestcommon divisor is in fact this commonvalue at the end of the process as amore complicated example suppose I wantto work out the greatest common divisorof 10 and I do n't know 18 well subtractthe smaller from the larger 10 and 8subtract the smaller from the larger toan 8 strict smaller than the larger 2and 6 2 & 4 2 & 2 and lo and behold 2 isin fact the greatest common divisor of10 and 18 but what 's the interestingbettors process not only did you coulddescribe this you show there 's oneconsequence to this that solves jugfilling problems that is for you'relooking for solutions of the four afterof equations the form whoops was my pengun 5x plus 3y equals 1 the greatestcommon divisor those two numbers you cansmell that gives you actual solutions hegoes I know to follow what we did herewe took the numbers 5 & 3 and we let thethe the bottom number the same Ishould 've caught the denominator notthinking fractions here but that too isreally the smallest number taken fromthe largest that 's really 5 minus 3 soI 'm going to just keep track of what thenumbers actually are in this process nowto go from the next line and from nextterminus of this linear chain we 'd havethe top number the same that 2 on thetop is still 5 minus 3 but this one isreally this 3- this too - through this three - thattop line 5-3 let me just do somearithmetic on that keeping the originalnumbers apartment three explicit threeminus five minus three would be to lotsof three minus five let 's go a littlebit further what 's the next step to gofrom here to here we lift the bottomnumber the same two times three minusfive and what we did to get this topnumbers who took the bottom number awayfrom the top that is we took thisnumerator 5-3 and subtracted from it thedenominator 2 times 3 minus 5 andkeeping the numbers three and five veryexplicit the bottom number is still thesame two times three minus five and thiswill be two lots of five minus threelots of three and in fact there we haveit we know we 've got the greatest commonfactor here one on one and in fact I'veexpressed it two different ways ascombinations original two numbers fiveand three the first one here at thebottom on on the bottom became it wasfill up the three-gallon jug twice antifuel the five gallon drug once thissolution corresponds to fill up the fivegallon jug twice anti fill thethree-gallon jug thrice so this processof our using the including algorithmpreusse a fundamental fact about thegreatest common factor of two numbersand what i need to do is state is hereis i 'll do it in black which makes itseriousfrom given two numbers a and B andsuppose the greatest common divisor thegreatest common factor is a number DEuclid actually in his algorithm notonly said how to get to the greatestcommon divisor I 'll repeat this effectthis one or the larger but he said ifyou 'd like you want to keep track of allthe numbers all the way through you'dactually prove that the greatest commondivisor can be written as a combinationof the two original numbers that is youcan find a value for x and the value fory such this that combination of a and Bis going to give you the greatest commondivisorone of these numbers may be negative soactually his method allows you to solveany type of drug filling problem if Iwas looking to to solve the problem ofthe with a nine gallon jug and a 16gallon jug their greatest commondivisors one yes his method would giveme a means to obtain one gallon of waterfrom those two jugsso here 's my little challenge for yousuppose I gave you a 21 gallon jugwhoops and a wino 35 gallon jugcould you please obtain for me onegallon of water from that good luckthanks very much test
