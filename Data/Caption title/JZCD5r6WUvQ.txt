sometimes a homework problem will askyou about the intercepts and asymptotesof a tangent function well let'sinvestigate that we start with theidentity tangent theta equals sine thetaof our cosine thetalet 's first find the zeros of tangentbecause of that identity the zeros oftangent will be exactly the same as thezeros of sine that is tangent thetaequals zero when sine theta equals zeronow sine theta equals zero at theinteger multiples of Pi so theta equalsfor example zero pi 2 pi and so onnow one way to say this a little morecompactly is to call it n pi where n isan integer so integer multiples of Pinow what does this have to do withx-intercepts well the zeros becomex-intercepts when you graph so thex-intercepts I 'll repeat this way wouldbe 0 0 pi 0 2 pi 0 and so on these arethe zeros of tangent and of course thesecond coordinate of an x-intercept isgoing to be 0 those are the x-interceptswhat about the asymptotes well tangenttheta is undefined when cosine thetaequals 0remember that identity cosine thetaequals 0 when theta equals PI over 2plus n PI again where n is any integerso this would be for example PI over 2 3PI over 2 5 PI over 2 and so on now whatdoes this have to do with asymptoteswell these are the places where tangentsgoing to be undefined so there will bevertical asymptotes at these placesvertical asymptotes are x equals PI over2three PI over two five PI over two andso on and of course it goes in thenegative direction 2x equals negative PIover 2 negative 3 PI over 2 negative 5PI over 2 and so if you 're ever askedabout the domain of the tangent functionsince these are the places where can'tit 's undefined you 'd say all realnumbers except these if you ever askedabout the range of the tangent functionthis - it 's all real numbers you can getany number out of the tangent functionbecause remember tangent represents theslope of the terminal side of an angleon the unit circle that can be anythingso once again the zeros of tangent andthe X intercepts integer multiples of PiTanja 's undefined vertical asymptotesthese are PI over 2 plus integermultiples of Pi test
