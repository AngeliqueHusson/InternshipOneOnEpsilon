okay today I want to take a little timeto discuss some more about somediscontinuities all right if you are notfamiliar with the topic ofdiscontinuities all right then youprobably need to watch one of my othervideos i made another video where I talkabout the different types ofdiscontinuities how you locate them onthe graphs whether they look like thatsort of thing and you really do needthat background information before youwatch this video I 'll go ahead and put alink for that video down in thedescription so you know preface annettewith that knowledge then we ought to beable to address questions like this allright let 's suppose that they tell youto find the x values if any at which Fis not continuous alright then theyfollow that up with which x values areremovable non-removable if thiscontinuity exists alright so we 're justgoing to run through some examples onhow you would go about approachinganswering questions such as this alrightso in my first example right here I'vegot F of x equals x squared plus 5xminus 1 okay so hopefully you recognizethat right off the bat that 's apolynomial curve all right it is an xsquared so it 's going to be a parabolaalright and hopefully somewhere alongthe line you 've been told that allpolynomial curves a degree to our higherare smooth and continuous alright soit 's going to be continuous everywherealright so I do n't have anydiscontinuities on here so as an answeryou just might want to write somethinglike f of X is continuous okay because Ido n't have any discontinuities so Ido n't have to worry about it okay so fof X is continuous all right taking alook at this example F of x equals 1over x squared plus 3 all right I dohave my students memorize several basicgraphs and how they shift and what theylook like this is not one that I reallyhave them memorized all right but it isa relatively simple one there 's avariety of ways you can approach thisall right you could just take a look atthis okay it 's a rational function allright so things that you have to worryabout are you know is there anyrestrictions on this domain is there anynumber that I would plug in for X thatwould makeend up dividing by zero that be a badthing that 's going to create a problemfor me here all right but if you juststart playing around with some numbersby plug in a negative all right negativeanything negative 1 negative 1 squaredis going to be 1 1 plus 3 is going togive me four so I 'm going to be goodthere if i plug in 0 all right I havethree in my denominator if i plug in apositive number like say if i plug in 5that 'd be 25 plus three more I 'm stillgoing to get a real number on that allright so i really know how manyrestrictions on this whatsoever if ihave no restrictions on my domain oranything that 's going to keep me fromdoing that the function has to becontinuous alright so again this turnsout to be a continuous function so ido n't really have to worry about anydiscontinuities all right f of X iscontinuous if you were n't sure aboutthat or you could n't go through thatanalysis to come to the conclusion thatit is continuous you could always use agraphing calculator and then put that inall right now in this example here we'vegot f of X equals sine PI over 2 X oknow hopefully you recall the sine graphis continuous everywhere now it 's nicelittle curvy line curvy graph and goingleft to right in all directions bothdirections alright and that littlecoefficient there all right it 's justgoing to kind of play with the graph youknow compress expand in one way oranother okay so i can conclude on thisone that f of x is again continuous onon the entire domain so f of X iscontinuous all right so I just wanted tothrow those in there because even thoughthey 're asking you to identifydiscontinuities they will give youfunctions which are continuous all rightyou do n't have to worry about them allright now for the ones that there 's alittle bit more work to all right let'stake a look at this example I 've got fof X is equal to 2x over x squared minus5x all right so this again is not goingto be real easy i 'm not going to be ableto sketch it i ca n't do a rough sketchreally really fat fast or anything so iam going to want to take a look atwhat 's happening to my denominator do ihave some restrictions that 's going tobe placed on this all right so firstthing i would probably do is look to seewhat i could factor all right ultimatelyI 'm going to see if there 's things thatI can cross out things of that natureokay so um let 's take this 2x over allright now let 's take that denominatorand go ahead and factor it if i factorout an X I 'm going to have an X minus 5in my denominator all right this isgoing to let me see my restrictionsreally really easy here okay now lookingat this denominator as its factored likethis all right I 've got somerestrictions if x is 0 all right I'mgoing to have a zero on that denominatorzero times anything is going to be zeroall right that 's gon na be bad okay soright here I 've got X can not equal 0that would be causing that division byzero okay looking here all right Icannot let x equal 5 because of X is 5again I 've got a zero right there allright so yes i know from doing this andseeing these restrictions in mydenominator that the function isdiscontinuous okay so here let 's kind ofwrite that out let 's write it out asdiscontinuous now it is discontinuousall right but why all right becausethere are restrictions for thedenominator all right that 's one way toput it all right now depending on howwell you remember some of your precalcskills and everything all right thatdenominator right there that 's going totell me where my vertical asymptotes areso in a pre calc class you would takethat rational function you take thatdenominator set it equal to zero andsolve just like I have done here allright and then whatever you get as yourrestrictions if you take it and plug itinto your numerator and it is a nonzeronumber you know you 've got a verticalasymptote going on ok so this x equalszero well if I take that and plug itback into that numerator i get 0 okay soi do n't have a vertical asymptote thereall right but obviously I 've gotsomething else going on there because Ica n't have x equals 0 all right at X youknow I said X ca n't be five all rightwell if I take five plug it back in thatnumerator 2 times 5 is going to give mea 10I 'm good there all right so depending onhow much you remember all right thisclearly tells you that you 've got avertical asymptote at five okay and thenthe only other thing that could be goingon here all right I can not let X equal 0all right it 's not going to be in thedomain of my function so that 's going tohave to be a hole there I know it 's nota vertical asymptote so I 'm gon na haveto have a hole there all right now let'sshow how it 's a hole all right let'stake that expression that 2x over x xminus x okay now if i take thisexpression and i simplify it all rightwhat am I got ta get an X on top and Igot next on the bottom all right so Ican cross them out right that'ssimplifying rational expressions allright or in other words I am removingthat x equals 0 right there all right sothen that discontinuity is a removablediscontinuity I just removed it when Icross it out all right and then aremovable discontinuity is a hole okayso let 's kind of sum up what we 've gothere all right we notice todiscontinuous because we gotrestrictions in that domain all rightnow it specifically wants to know whichX values are removable non-removable ifa discontinuity exists so i wouldprobably some up an answer asdiscontinuities or it 's here let 's justsay discontinuous and spell thatwritings below you in therediscontinuous at X equals 0 and weconclude include it by crossing that outthere that it is a removablediscontinuity right there and then myother one is at x equals 5 all right andwe concluded that it 's a verticalasymptote going there so I 've got sometype of infinite discontinuity going onso that makes it non removableokay so answering the question rightthere all right so clearly way more workto the problem when you do run into thethe discontinuity occurring ok now let'sdo a couple other examples where you'vegot a little bit more work to them andthere are discontinuities that areshowing up ok so in this right here I'vegot f of x equals x plus 2 all over xsquared minus 4 ok so again all rightyou 're not going to know what thatsketches right top your head and let'sassume you do n't have a graphingcalculator all right so what are yougoing to start doing to this you'regoing to start by factoring it see ifyou can cross anything out you 're goingto look at that denominator and see ifthere 's any type of restrictions that'sgoing on all right so I 'm going to haveX plus 2 in my numerator if i factorthat denominator that 's the differenceof two squares x + 2 X minus 2 ok soright away all right I ca n't take a lookat this denominator if I set everythingequal to 0 I 'm going to find somerestrictions in my denominator all rightsetting that equal to 0 all right Xcannot be equal to negative 2 because ifit was that would make that a 0 thatmake me having a 0 in the denominatorand I ca n't divide by 0 all right littlerestrictions from here X can not equal toall right because again if X is 2 thatbecomes 0 I got a denominator of 0that 's going to be no good right therealright so right off the bat all right Iknow that it is discontinuous all rightso it 's discontinuousall right then let 's also qualify byhere it 's because there are restrictionsfor the denominator okay and then hereagain let 's go through and analyze justa little bit more what 's going on hereall right could these any of these besome vertical asymptotes all right let'stake this to right here all right if Itake two and i plug it back into thenumerator I get two plus two which forall right so that right there tells me xat x equals 2 i 've got a verticalasymptote going on all right and sothat 's going to be what 's causing thatdiscontinuity all right now let 's take alook at this negative 2 if i plug thisnegative 2 in all right negative 2 plus2 that gives me a zero all right so thisdoes not qualify as a vertical asymptoteall right but here again I know I can'tlet x equals negative 2 if it 's not avertical asymptote then something 's gotto be going on right there all right andit 's going to end up being a hole allright now you want to prove that it'sgoing to be a hole or algebraically showthat it 's going to be a hole let 's takethat expression it 's all right and thenlet 's factor it let 's factor it outcross out see what we 've got here I'vealready done the factory in rather allright now can I crash on yes can I crossout yes I 've got a binomial X plus twobinomial X plus 2 all right I can crossthat out all right as soon as I cross itout i 'm removing that x equals negative2 so I 'm making a removablediscontinuity right there okay so to sumup over all answer here I would havewould be discontinuous at spell it rightthis time there we go discontinuous atall right couple different places at myx equals negative 2 all right and thenwe said I 'm crossed it out there so thatmakes it removable and more specificallywe know that 's going to be a hole andthen I also have one at that verticalasymptote at x equals 2 all rightbecause it 's a vertical asymptotevertical asymptote going on right thereI know it 's going to be a non removablediscontinuity larrigan not doing a verygood job on my spelling tonight okay weget the idea non-removable good allright now let 's do one more before wedraw to a close here all right let'stake a look at a piecewise function allright a lot of times kids are going towant to just automatically do a sketch Isuppose there 's nothing wrong with thatall right however if you can honestlythink through what 's going on in thispiecewise function all right I thinkyou 're going to be better off it'sprobably going to be quicker than youattempting to draw a sketch okay I'vegot two pieces this one is made up oftwo straight lines so that one 's goingto be pretty simple all right my mainfocus here is at one what the heck isgoing on at one all right well at xequals 1 if i plug one in right thereall right I 'm going to have 2 times 12-1 it 's going to give me an answer ofone okay and i would have a closed dotright there so at 11 i would have aclosed dot all right now on this portionof the graph for x is less than 1 Iwould take one plug it in one plus twois three all right i 'm at a differentspot and I would have an open dot so at13 I would have an open dot at one whatI say that was 11 all right i would havea closed dot all right so picturingwhat 's happening right there you 've gotto have a jump in that graph okay so forthose that are not picturing this okaylet 's kind of do a really rough sketchhere all right when I did this for X isgreater than or equal to 1 i plugged onein two minus one is one all right so at11 so add 11 I know I have a closed dotall right and it 's to the right of 1okay this is one to the right of one allright let 's just guess rough slope hereI do n't know maybe something like thatall right now let 's do the second partof this X is less than one ok so i plugone in 1 plus 2 is going to give methree so at 13 I 've got an open dotbecause that 's less thanalright and then I want everything lessthan 1 this is a straight line let 's doa really really rough sketch let 's say Iknow it 's going to go through two solet 's kind of something along thoselines okay but see how long it took meto do that sketch even though I wasdoing a really really rough sketch allright it 's a lot easier all right i plugin 1 i get one i plug in 1 i get 3 Iknow I 've got to have a jump going onthere well if I 've got to jump thenobviously I have a discontinuity allright so i could conclude here that itis discontinuous at and we know whereit 's at it 's right there at one so xequals 1 all right it is a non-removablebecause I 've clearly shown that it is ajump all right so it 's non removablemuch better job on spelling there okayall right so just some examples of youknow applying this concept ofdiscontinuity and identifying it fromlooking at the functions especially whenyou do n't have a graphing calculator howare you going to do this where are yougoing to do and how are you going toapproach it okay if you liked the videogo ahead and get me like and if you wantsome more help in math go ahead
