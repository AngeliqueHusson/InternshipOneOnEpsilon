want think supporting time dis cussed symmetric encryption rely user sup plied key drive algorithm anything en crypted given key de crypted key al ice bob exchange secure agree key al ice bob communicate eavesdropper like eve supposed agree secret key first place symmetric key protocol like aes advanced encryption standard simple fast practical purpose unbreakable unless time travel al ice bob ca n use symmetric key share key first chicken egg problem achill es heel allude last episode yes al ice bob could share key person courier typically line exchange like impractical impossible sense practice aes almost everything theres clearly got way al ice bob get key sha ring hump actually broadly speaking three episode discuss two foreshadow third get another time go option one sha ring symmetric key n instead use asymmetric key cryptography also known public key cryptography clear moment idea use two key property anything en crypted one de crypted work describe key swill related somehow come back shortly let assume key outline step used communicate securely generate two disseminate one publicly keep private never sha ring anyone even bob bob follow suit send bob message al ice encrypt bob public key bob know counterpart key private key de crypt message course bob could message al ice public keynote al ice also use system authenticate bob well first encrypt message private key encrypt result bob public key bob outer layer still en crypted inner layer de crypt al ice public key know message al ice private key meaning fact sent extrapolate everyone generate key pair publish es half pair anyone principle communicate securely anyone else even never previously spoken even met nitty gritty actually generate pair function like fact key flaw system mean know protocol key public know al ice public key also public way reverse engineer private key fact asymmetric key scheme viable math use hood guarantee three key actually work tandem like second key fast easy third reverse engineering private key public one theoretically possible infeasible short need something cal led one way function operation easy exceedingly difficult undo famous r sa protocol one way function plain old multiplication wo n get detail much written elsewhere nutshell r sa begin choosing two prime least one hundred decimal get large composite number know prime factor n since built n first place turns also produce two e following fascinating property n arithmetic raising number e power power vise give back original number picture n message want send n e together public key kept private technically modular exponentiation per formed also one way function raising something e th power n easy taking e th root n really hard reason n identify one way function r sa another attack r sa trap door namely given could deduce e knew prime factor identify multiplication undone super slow factor ing relevant one way function factor ing much multiplication private key de fact safe despite n open dirty little secret factor ing algorithm actually gotten pretty stay head algorithm even bigger ie longer key sand comes asymmetric encryption scheme thousand symmetric one sand use way computational top keep generating ever gigantic key overhead become problem especially mobile device processor weak power said asymmetric scheme slow even without extra huge reason real world hybrid scheme option two al ice bob encrypt stuff quickly inexpensively via symmetric protocol like aes use asymmetric scheme front transmit symmetric message eve ca n read note cracking r sa would compromise symmetric encryption even though symmetric encryption factor ing large number sit main thing encode symmetric key snow extra safety modern web security n allow reuse either symmetric asymmetric generate public private key pair current session use pair share symmetric key also throw away session nevertheless encrypt front r sa cracked everything fall apart vulnerability along increasing bloatedness r sa key two interesting going use asymmetric encryption one way could base undo algorithm factor ing could get away smaller key sand second option three reference top episode actually exist word way al ice bob share symmetric key besides full blown asymmetric encryption turns question answer yes diving take us much math specifically cyclic group finite field sand upcoming
