the bagel opens up in a rathersurprising way the Mobius strip is oneof my favorite mathematical structuresit 's only got one side usually we cut abagel open straight down the middle andit has a left and a right so it dividesinto two cores but if we cut it along amobius strip it 's not going to be quitethe same I 'm going to cut the bagelstarting with my knife in this directionbut as I cut I 'm going to turn the knifeso that when I get back to the beginningI 'm facing the other way so I 'll startmy cut here around I go now I 'm going tostart twisting so that I 'm now facingsideways all this big seems to bedelicious and now I 've made it round I'mcoming around the other way up so thatwhen I get back to the beginning theleft-hand side of my knife will meet theplace that my right hand side startedand when I 'm donethe baitul opens up in a rathersurprising way because it has n't beencut in half it ca n't separate into twobecause the cutting surface only had oneside so it 's cut open along this kind ofspiral that 's a mobius strip which meansthat if I take some cream cheese I canspread it all the way over this bagelwithout ever taking my knife off exceptto get more cream cheese around there ohand I 've met the beginning of where I'vealready put the cream cheese a deliciousMobius bagel [ Music ] A mathematician explains the best way to cut a bagel A mathematician explains the best way to cut a bagel A mathematician explains the best way to cut a bagel
