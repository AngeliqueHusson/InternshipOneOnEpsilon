Last weekend I actually did a talk on math in the Simpsons here in Melbourne and I am going tosplit it up into three different videos so today get the first one nice and shotsome of you will be familiar with this first clip but I think I 've got a fewtwists and turns to add to all this which will entertain most of you . Okay , here we go : ( Homer ) Something you don'tsee every day . Anybody lose their classes ? Last chance . The sum of the square roots of any two sidesof an isosceles triangle is equal to the square root of the remaining side . ( Guy in the cubicle ) . That 's aright triangle you idiot ! That 's great . So what does he say ? Well , that . The sum of the square roots of any two sides of an isosceles triangleis equal to the square root of the remaining side . Which sounds verysimilar to this guy , right ? Pythagoras , a squared plus b squared equals c squared.Well , it sounds very similar so what if he actually meant to say this what were hismistakes ? Well , the guy in the background already pointed out one of them . It is not anisosceles triangle , it 's a right triangle . What else there'sthere 's other things that do n't work . ( Giuseppe ) Any two sides ? That 's fine so anytwo sides , it 's got to be those two here in Pythagoras and then there is one more which isof course ... ( Giuseppe ) the sum of the square roots . The sum of the square roots does not work , any two sides does not work but that got me thinking , I meanHomer knows what an isosceles triangle is ? That 's ridiculous ! So maybe he actually did not have Pythagoras in mind . Maybehe learned it somewhere else . And there is actually another Simpsons episode that gives us a bit of a hint.where he may have learned it . ( Lisa ) There is new marshmellows in the Belfast charms . ( Marge ) No , no that 's Bart 's cereal . It 's the only way I can get him to take his vitamins . ( Bart ) The sum of the square roots of any two sides of an isosceles triangle is equal to the square root of the remaining side . ( Lisa ) That 's not right itis my lines as the scarecrow in The Wizard of Oz . The scarecrow in the Wizard of Oz.Actually , if you go to the movie and you find . the ( Scarecrow ) The sum of the square roots of any two sides of an isosceles triangle is equal to the square root of the remaining side.Oh joy rapture , I 've got a brain.So he says this after he 's got the brain.well you could have bad deal but maybe not maybe maybe he 's rightjust because the sound similar to what I would does n't mean that has to becorrect that have a very very close slow it is correct what makes not tried buttwo sides that have all right now what does it say if I do n't despair of thisat all of that you get out of this but he also says you ca n't do this any twosides should also be able to start of this perspective that is scared of thattoo let 's also right that one now have a look at this one does n't know where thatit 's ok but I mean you 've got two tons as scared of even on two sides of theequation to what can we do it can just cancel cancel goes and then what 's leftover its gon na be equal to 0 which means that these equal to 0 may be consideredas I was trying but usually not so I mean there 's definitely something that'snot quite right but let us forget about this any to side business maybe maybemaybe just this once met a lot of a beating him enter the window asreporters two things together to go but we do n't know where to get one squareroots so now we 'll have a really close look at it and actually can do this inpictures so what does says we 've got like a a and B is four times as long asa and three obvious make any triangle of anything like this soforget about it it 's big it 's not gon na work out so it 's pretty wrong very wrongbut it can get even have a look at any China what ever you can actually get soagain to get ready to square root square holding a square here so now when we getto you we get the first time i squared plus two times that plus so what 's theSun squared and then we get plus can see ok now just rearranged as a little bitand you get a + be + something but he says is that she is a little bit longerthan a and be put together so there 's a tizzy and see a little bit longer andagain it 's pretty obvious so it 's pretty wrong also I mean this this this is asocialist triangle in the plane what happens if you actually kind of look attriangles maybe on a on a sphere anything like this can you actually getlike 100 to work anywherewell well in the plane but really kills this one here is the fact that in anytriangle and be always add up to something that 's bigger ditsy and basicthe Scarecrow contradicts so what we're really aiming for is a world in whichdisc I here 's the triangle inequality in and actually turns out that very hard tofind anything reasonable where this does n't hold the phone sample if youlook at triangle honest here they also decided so even on a three-yearscarecrows work workbut you know there 's a lot of mathematicians out there who reallyreally strange work so maybe one of you has an idea for strange world where wecan actually make us work ok but now actually also started digging to seewhat I can actually find pythagoras now pythagoras actually does pop up in thisinstance I know of two instances and actually one of your mission is going tobe too she got out where exactly in those clips pops up maybe some of youactually know of other instances scarecrow in the sense that I 'd reallylike to know about it even other at the moviesepisode of a TV episodes really interesting running out and put insimpson 's lovers among you as a pinpoint all the episodes of these things are oklook at first slip and see what he can do you just like the one you know it'sfalse advertising no refunds paid for a colossalgoodmay have to do this on train before impact but do n't get a credit crunchthat 44 today Math in the Simpsons: Homer's theorem Math in the Simpsons: Homer's theorem Math in the Simpsons: Homer's theorem
