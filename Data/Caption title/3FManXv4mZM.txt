So quadrilateral ABCD , they're telling us it is a rhombus , and what we need to do , we need to provethat the area of this rhombus is equal to 1/2 times AC times BD.So we 're essentially proving that the area of a rhombusis 1/2 times the product of the lengths of its diagonals.So let 's see what we can do over here.So there 's a bunch of things we know about rhombiand all rhombi are parallelograms , so there 's tons of things that we know about parallelograms.First of all , if it 's a rhombus , we know that all of the sidesare congruent.So that side length is equal to that side length isequal to that side length is equal to that side length.Because it 's a parallelogram , we knowthe diagonals bisect each other.So we know that this length -- letme call this point over here B , let'scall this E. We know that BE is going to be equal to ED.So that 's BE , we know that's going to be equal to ED.And we know that AE is equal to EC.We also know , because this is a rhombus , and we proved this in the last video , that the diagonals , not only do they bisect each other , but they are also perpendicular.So we know that this is a right angle , this is a right angle , that is a right angle , and then this is a right angle.So the easiest way to think about itis if we can show that this triangle ADC iscongruent to triangle ABC , and if we can figure outthe area of one of them , we can just double it.So the first part is pretty straightforward.So we can see that triangle ADC isgoing to be congruent to triangle ABC , and we know that by side-side-side congruency.This side is congruent to that side.This side is congruent to that side , and they both sharea C right over here.So this is by side-side-side.And so we can say that the area -- so because of that , we know that the area of ABCD is justgoing to be equal to 2 times the area of , we could pick either one of these.We could say 2 times the area of ABC.Because area of ABCD -- actually let me write it this way.The area of ABCD is equal to the area of ADC plus the areaof ABC.But since they're congruent , these twoare going to be the same thing , so it 's justgoing to be 2 times the area of ABC.Now what is the area of ABC ? Well area of a triangle is just 1/2 base times height.So area of ABC is just equal to 1/2 times the baseof that triangle times its height , which is equal to 1/2.What is the length of the base ? Well the length of the base is AC.So it 's 1/2 -- I'll color code it.The base is AC.And then what is the height ? What is the height here ? Well we know that this diagonal right over here , that it 's a perpendicular bisector.So the height is just the distance from BE.So it 's AC times BE , that is the height.This is an altitude.It intersects this base at a 90-degree angle.Or we could say BE is the same thing as 1/2 times BD.So this is -- let me write it.This is equal to , so it's equal to 1/2 times AC , that'sour base.And then our height is BE , which we 're sayingis the same thing as 1/2 times BD.So that 's the area of just ABC , that'sjust the area of this broader triangle right up there , or that larger triangle right up there , that half of the rhombus.But we decided that the area of the whole thingis two times that.So if we go back , if we use both this informationand this information right over here , we have the area of ABCDis going to be equal to 2 times the area of ABC , where the area of ABC is this thing right over here.So 2 times the area of ABC , area of ABCis that right over there.So 1/2 times 1/2 is 1/4 times AC times BD.And then you see where this is going.2 times 1/4 fourth is 1/2 times AC times BD.Fairly straightforward , which is a neat result.And actually , I haven't done this in a video.I 'll do it in the next video.There are other ways of finding the areas of parallelograms , generally.It 's essentially base times height , but for a rhombuswe could do that because it is a parallelogram , but we also have this other neat little resultthat we proved in this video.That if we know the lengths of the diagonals , the area of the rhombus is 1/2 times the productsof the lengths of the diagonals , which is kind of a neat result .
