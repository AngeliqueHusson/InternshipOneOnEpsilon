okay adding fractions is one of thehardest operations to do one of hardestthings do a fractions multiplying iseasier division you can turn into amultiplication using keep change flipand is a video to explain that butadding fractions and subtracting becauseit 's very similar is the hardest and thebiggest mistake we see students do isthe following1/2 plus 1/2 now when you multiply youjust work with the top and work with thebottom so let 's do that on this one 1plus 1 is 2 2 plus 2 is 4cancel that down you get 1/2 oh now youcan see that is n't rightyou can see that if you 've got half andanother half it does n't equal 1/2 equalsa whole 1 so this is the biggest mistakewe see we see people doing what they dofor multiplication and just applying itto addition without thinking you can'thave a whole 1 am half of 1 plus 1/2 1and get another 1/2 it 's not possible sothat just tells us or should tell usthat it 's not right so if you do n't wantto check just try and see does it workdoes n't work so what we do instead welllet 's think about what it 's saying wehave 1/2 and we add another 1/2 so howmany halves do we have in total thehalves have n't changed we still havehalves so the bottom number stays thesame is still harms it 's not changingjust we got one of them and now we'readding another one to them well 1 plus 1is 2 so we have 2 halves well 2 dividedby 2 is simply 1 as we would expect 1/2plus 1/2 equals 2 over 2 g equals 1 wekeep the bottom number or thedenominator this same and then we justadd the top number we add the numeratoron the numerators they get 2 and that'sthe same for all fractions which havethe same bottom number 1/3 plus 1/3 wellif I have 1/3 and add another third toit I 'm asking how many thirds do I have1 plus 1 is 2 I 've got 2/3or 1/5 plus 2/5 it 's still about howmany fifths I have so the same bottomnumbers same denominator and now add thetop numbers and numerators 1 plus 2 is 33/5 so when you 're adding simplefractions where the bottom numbers arethe same make sure that you just thinkabout in terms of or how many of thattype of fraction do I have so that 's theeasy ones and everyone should be able toget those with a bit of practice nowthey do get harder because what about1/2 plus 1/3 1/2 plus 1/3 now it 's nolonger right to say well how many halvesdo we have or how many thirds do we haveI want to know what 1/2 plus 1/3 is sowhat I 'm going to think about is if Ican change that 1/2 into a type offraction which I can also change thethird inning okay so I 've got to thinkkind of changed my denominator my bottomnumber into another number bymultiplying it well the answer is yes Ican6 I can turn that into 6 I can turn itinto glutes of numbers I can tell it in10 I can turn it into 8 I can tell youinto lots of numbers but the good thingabout this 6 is I can also turn this 3into 6 by multiplying three 2s are 6 sonow if I can keep the size of thefraction the same here and here I cannow talk about the addition because nolonger am I trying to combine halves andthirds but I 'm combining sixths so it'snow about how many sixths do I have andthen we can see if it cancels backafterwards ok so let 's look at it I'vechange this 2 to a 6 by multiplying by 3so to keep this fraction the same I'vegot to multiply the top number by 3 3times by 1 is 3it 's just check is 3 out of 6 1/2 3sixths 1/2 it is so I 've got that rightwhat about this one I 've multiplied 3 by2 to get 6 solet 's multiply one by two there you goand you get two on top now three plustwo is then five so I have five six soalthough I have n't got the answer ishalves or thirds I have now got ananswer which combines the two into asimple question so I 've turned it intoone of the easier ones by changing thetwo into a six and the three into a sixcircle another example maybe one is abit easier to spotwhat about 1/2 plus 1/4 right now it'snot asking how many halves I have or howmany quarters I 've got I 'm just sayingwhat is 1/2 and 1/4 in total wellhopefully quite quickly you can see Icould write that 1/2 as 2/4 and thatkeep that as quarters now I 've changedthe question to how many quarters I haveso keeping the button I 'm the same thatdenominator the same add numerators Iget 3/4 so for all these questions weare aiming to change the bottom numbersso they are same but keep the size ofthe original fraction the same half apizza is the same with 2/4 pizza there'sa half and two quarters it 's the sameamount so we have n't changed thequestion we just rewritten it in a formthat we can have the same type offraction the same denominator and thenall the questions are just variations ofthat now let 's just check one moreexample a little bit harder let 's do 3/5plus and 5/6 justI think of something there you go 3/5plus 5/6 so let 's start by thinkingabout a number that we can convert both5 into and 6 into so it 's like thequestion out underneath we ca n't justadd the numbers together that 's notright okay so what can i and 6 intowhat 's in both the 5 times table and a 6times table now if you ca n't think ofany other number what you can do is youcan always multiply these two numberstogether to give you an answer but ok oryou can list them out here 's my fivetimes table 5 10 15 so on and here 's my6 times table I 'm writing out mymultiples here okay and look which isthe lowest multiple in both lists 30 sothis is you have to do lowest commonmultiple so this is a use of lowestcommon multiples okay so now 30 so we'regoing to use 30 so rather than addingfifths and sixths together we 're goingto add thirtieths okay now we 've got tokeep the size of this fraction the sameso to get from 5 to 30 I 've multipliedby 6 so I 've got to multiply the top by6 or 3 sixes are 18 of a check here 1 23 3 sixes are 18 and what about gettingfrom 635 times five and five let 's addthese together five times by five is 25ok so now what I 'm going to do is add 25to 18 now do n't rush it if you need towrite it to the side it 's better you getit right then guess it and get it wronga 5 8 is 13 and 2 plus 1 plus 1 is 4that 's 43 over 30if that helps I hope that helps if notcome and see us and watch our othervideos on how to convert
