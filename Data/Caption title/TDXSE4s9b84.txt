hi coming another math video help boost score math class improve understanding hopefully make math fun less stressful video let get right want find volume pyramid cones right whats formula area base times height see capital b mean area bottom times height dont want get confused surface area slant height use letter l slant height thats angled height leaning height want perpendicular height perpendicular distance center base vertex thats overall height thing cone going center base k perpendicular vertex right k ahead example pyramid one thing wan ted show put pyramid oka yin box like visualize put abox pyramid would take volume box bases height pyramid like know diagonal angle could actually fit two pyramid cut know divide somehow would know fit taking thats see let go ahead volume equal oka rea base base see square going times thats times overall height dont want height sometimes ill give dont want want go times thats gon na give volume thats going cube k next one cone ill cone exact formula like kind group formula together like theres less memorize might want thing cones pyramid kind shape right different kind b think circle whats area circle pir squared thats base right times height want perpendicular height radius five pi times five squared thats pi times one third times height multiply together thats going give volume cube quick note sometimes student get little bit know trip ped fraction think whole number fraction one would multiply numerator denominator would divide case thats times pi thats pi want exact answer want round answer use three times one times one times one three go thats exact answer could make divided get decimal round exact hope video go ahead subscribe channel check past video got like coming ways make better theyre helping id really appreciate knowing put comment section see future video ill talk soon volume cone pyramid find formula volume cone pyramid find formula volume cone pyramid find formula volume cone pyramid find formula volume cone pyramid find formula volume cone pyramid find formula
