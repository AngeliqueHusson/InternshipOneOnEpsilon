what 's up everyone and welcome to thisvery special lesson on finding perimeterand area in rectangular figures so we'llstart off by asking the question what isperimeterso for rectangles we can think ofperimeter as measuring the length alongthe entire outside of the figureand since perimeter is the outsidelength of the figure area is going to beall the space covered inside the figureand we measure area in square unitsso on a rectangular football field wecan think of perimeter as how many footsteps it would take you to walk aroundthe entire outside length of the fieldwhile area would be like finding theentire number of square feet that wouldhave to be covered to mow the grassokay so let 's go ahead and take a shotat finding the perimeter of a rectanglewith a length of 4 centimeters and aheight of 3 centimeters now I know thatthe opposite sides in a rectangle arethe same length so I 'm going to go aheadand label that and now I 'm totally readyto find the length of the perimeter ofthis rectangle now I can visualize thisby imagining taking the two widths boththree centimeters long each as well asthe two lengths that are both 4centimeters each and adding them alltogether 3 plus 3 plus 4 plus 4 whichwill give us a perimeter of 14centimeters the sum of all the sides ofthe rectangle now the cool thing is thatthis works for any rectangle so we'regoing to say that perimeter for anyrectangular figure is equal to the sumof all the sides along all that means isyou take all the sides and you add themup but what if I wanted to find the areaof this figure now the width of thisrectangle is 3 centimeters so let'svisualize cutting this into three equalparts horizontally one centimeter inwith each then the length is 4centimeters long so we can imaginecutting this vertically into fourdifferent sections that are also onecentimeter each and this creates thosesquare units that we were talking aboutand now we can just count them up tofind the area in this case thisrectangle has 12 square centimeter areanow did you notice that the length of 4centimeters and the width of 3centimeters when multiplied together 4times 3 is equal to 12 which was ourarea and this is cool because this ruleis going to apply to finding the area ofany rectangular figure and we can saythat the area is going to equal thelength times the width okay so now thatwe know this stuff let 's go ahead andapply it to some real-life situations sofor our first example we want to knowhow many feetsensing what a farmer need if she wantedto enclose a rectangular garden that is12 feet long and 8 feet wide now fencingonly goes around the outside of a gardenso we know that this is a perimeterquestion so first I use the giveninformation and I label my diagram thelength is 12 feet the width is 8 feetand because it 's a rectangle theopposite sides are the same so I labelthose two and now I want to find the sumof those sides so I 'm going to add 12plus 12 plus 8 plus 8 again it 's the sumof the sides and now I want to add thosefour numbers up that 'll get me myperimeter which is 40 feet of fencing atthe farmer would need to build a fencearound her garden so for our nextscenario we 're going to join the streetartist named Craig who 's painting amural on the side of a building that's15 feet long and 10 feet wide and whatwe want to find is exactly how manysquare feet he 's going to have to paintin order to complete the mural now thekey info here is that the length is 15feet and that the width is 10 feet andthat we want to find the number ofsquare feet he 's going to need tocomplete the mural they should let usknow that this is an area question so wehave to use the area formula because wewant to find the inside of the rectangleand not the outside so the length is 15feet the width is 10 feet and againusing the formula I multiply lengthtimes width 15 times 10 is equal to 150the number of square feet that Craigwill have to paint to complete the muralhaha cool now we 're ready for a moreadvanced example in this scenario Mariahas constructed a rectangular fence witha perimeter of 200 feet around herbackyard swimming pool and we are giventhe width of the rectangular enclosureat 60 feet so I can draw a diagram andlabel the width on each side of therectangle at 60 and what I want to findis how many feet is the length of therectanglenow since I do n't know that number I'mjust going to label it with a questionmark now that question mark representsthe number that 's going to be our answerand we 're going to use our knowledge ofperimeter to find out what that numberis now since we already know what P iswe know the perimeter is 200 feet thequestion told us that and we also knowthat perimeter equals the sum of thesides that means that if I take thosetwo widths of 60 and add them up alongwith whatever those two lengths arethose two question marks that sum isgoing to give me the perimeter of 200now if I add 60 and 60 together that sumis equal to 120 and what 's left over iswell I need to add to it to get to 200120 plus 80 would equal to hundred sothose two question marks together has toequal 80 since 120 plus 80 equals 200but that represents two sides of therectangle so I have to divide that 80 bytwo and we see that each length is goingto be 40 since 120 plus 40 plus 40equals 200 which is the perimeter of thefencing that goes around her swimmingpool so now we can finally answer thequestion and say that the length of theenclosure is 40 feet long and in ourlast example we 're going to join Alexand David who owned a company that makesvinyl skins for smart phone coversnow we know that each rectangular skinhas a length of six inches and an areaof eighteen square inches so this is anarea question we 're going to use thatlength times width formula and what wewant to find out is the width of eachcase that 's what we do n't know but we'regoing to use our knowledge of area tofind we 'll just call it a question markfor right now now the area which we knowis 18 equals length times width thelength is 6 times the width again that'swhat I do n't know so let 's just call itquestion mark now if I look at thisclosely 6 multiplied by some unknownnumber has to equal 18 does anybody knowwhat that number isnow if you guess three you are correctsince the area eight tomb is equal tothe product of six and three so we cansay that the width of each case is threeinches and we can visualize why eachcase has an area of 18 square inches soagain we answer the question that thewidth is just three inches and we
