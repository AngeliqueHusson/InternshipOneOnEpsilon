Hello.I 'm Professor Von Schmohawk and welcome to Why U.We have seen that multiplying any decimal number by tenshifts each digit in the number one column to the left.In the last lecture , we used this trick to convert decimal numbers with a finite number of digits into fractions.In this lecture , we will see how to convert '' repeating '' decimal numbers into fractions.Repeating decimal numbers have one or more digits after the decimal pointthat repeat forever.As an example , let¡¯s convert a decimal number with one infinitely repeating digitinto a fraction.The first step is to eliminate the infinitely repeating digit.We do this by first multiplying the number by ten to shift it one column to the left , and then subtracting the original number.Since both numbers in this example have an infinite number of repeating fives , this eliminates all the repeating fives after the decimal point.We know that our original decimal number is equal to some fraction , but we don¡¯t yet know what that fraction is.However , we do know that when it is subtracted from ten times itself , we get five.Let¡¯s write this statement as an equation.Ten times the fraction , minus the fraction , equals five.It is possible to write this statement more simply.Subtracting one thing from ten things leaves nine things.So instead of writing ¡°ten times the fraction , minus the fraction¡±we can simply write ¡°nine times the fraction¡±.Since both sides of the equation are equal , we can divide each side by the same number and they will still be equal.Let¡¯s divide both sides by nine.Notice that on the left side of the equation , the fraction is multiplied AND divided by nine.This leaves its value unchanged , so we can cancel out the nines on the left side of the equation.We are left with an equation which says that the fraction is equal to five-ninths.We have converted our repeating decimal number to the fraction five-ninths.Let¡¯s try this again with a repeating sequence of threes.As we did in the previous example , we eliminate the one repeating digitby multiplying by ten one time , and then subtracting the original number.This eliminates all the repeating threes to the right of the decimal point.So ten times the fraction , minus the fraction , equals three.We write this as an equation which we can simplify to say : ¡°Nine times the fraction equals three¡±.We then divide each side of the equation by nineso that the nines on the left side cancel.This equation tells us that our fraction is equal to three-ninths.Of course the fraction three-ninths can be reduced to one-third.So we have converted this repeating decimal number to the fraction one-third.Now instead of a single repeating digit , let¡¯s convert a decimal number with a repeating sequence of three digits.Since there are three repeating digits to eliminate , we must shift the number three columns to the left , by multiplying it by ten three times.This , of course , is the same as multiplying by one-thousand.We then subtract our original number , which eliminates the repeating digits.Now we write this as an equation : One-thousand times the fraction , minus the fraction , equals one-hundred-twenty-three.One-thousand times the fraction , minus the fractionis the same as nine-hundred-ninety-nine times the fraction.And dividing both sides of the equation by nine-hundred-ninety-ninecancels out the nine-hundred-ninety-nine on the left.So our fraction is equal to one-hundred-twenty-three nine-hundred-ninety-ninths.Let¡¯s see what happens with the repeating decimal numberzero-point-one , followed by an infinite number of sixes.Since there is only one repeating digit , six , we shift the number one column to the left by multiplying by ten one time , and subtract the original number.This eliminates the repeating sixes , and we are left with one-point-five.We then write the equation : '' Ten times the fraction , minus the fraction , equals one-point-five '' , which we can simplify to¡°Nine times the fraction equals one-point-five¡±.Dividing both sides of the equation by nine eliminates the nines on the left , and we see that our fraction is equal to one-point-five over nine.But we have a problem.A fraction¡¯s numerator and denominator must be integers.We can solve this problem by multiplying the top and bottom of the fraction by tento create two integers.This gives us fifteen-ninetieths , which can be reduced to one-sixth.So this repeating decimal number is equal to one-sixth.As a final example , let¡¯s reduce a number that has the repeating sequence of digits , one-four-two-eight-five-seven.Since there are six repeating digits , we shift this number six columns to the left by multiplying it by ten six times , which is the same as multiplying by one-million.We then subtract the original number.This eliminates all but one copy of the repeating sequence.We are left with the integer , one-four-two-eight-five-seven.We then write the equation : '' One million times the fraction , minus the fraction , equals one-four-two-eight-five-seven . `` Using the same logic as before , the left side of this equation can be simplified tonine-nine-nine-nine-nine-nine times the fraction.Dividing both sides of the equation by nine-nine-nine-nine-nine-nine , leaves us with an equation which says that our number is equal to the fractionone-four-two-eight-five-seven over nine-nine-nine-nine-nine-nine.Using the factoring techniques we learned in the lecture on reducing fractions , this scary-looking fraction can be reduced to one-seventh.So we have discovered that this repeating decimal numberis equivalent to the fraction one-seventh.This concludes our lectures on fractions.So far we have learned about the properties of the arithmetic operationsaddition , subtraction , multiplication , and division.In our next lecture , we will introduce the mathematical operation of `` exponentiation '' .
