voice previous video explore dhow cosine angle relate essentially take terminal ray angle reflect x axis axes want video think little bit tangent different little bit reminder know tangent theta equal sine angle cosine angle unit circle definition essentially saying slope terminal ray right remind slope rise change vertical axis change horizontal axis starting origin change vertical axis go zero sine theta well change vertical axis sine theta change horizontal axis cosine theta change change x terminal ray tangent theta sine theta cosine theta could view slope ray right think angle going exact tangent theta ray collinear ray right herein fact put together get line tangent angle right pink angle going way around tangent pi plus theta tangent theta plus pi obviously could write theta plus pi instead pi plus theta based slope argument equal tangent see actually case two thing equal agree tangent angle equal slope terminal ray course side angle going positive x axis convention set think tangent theta plus pi term sine cosine let write pink color tangent pink tangent pi plus theta going equal put parentheses avoid ambiguity equal sine pi plus theta theta plus pi cosine theta plus previous video established sine theta plus pi thing negative sine theta equal negative sine theta cosine theta plus pi already established thing negative cosine theta negative divided negative could say negative cancel left sine theta cosine theta indeed tangent theta feel pretty good point terminal ray right let think point tangent negative theta going know tangent negative theta thing sine negative theta cosine negative theta already established sine negative theta negative sine theta see right sine negative theta negative opposite sine theta cosine negative theta thing cosine theta thing left negative sine theta cosine theta thing equal negative tangent theta see take negative angle going get negative tangent sine numerator definition tangent sign denominator tangent negative theta thing negative tangent theta point right well relative theta looking pi minus theta looking tangent pi minus theta sine pi minus theta cosine pi minus theta already established previous video sine pi minus theta equal sine theta see right exact equal sine theta cosine pi minus theta well opposite cosine theta negative cosine theta going equal negative sine cosine negative tangent theta make sense ray slope ray right see slope could view negative tangent theta see looking two combine ray negative slope mirror image across x axis seen take angle add pi angle tangent wo n change going essentially sitting line pi everything degree going degree around going opposite direction slope ray tangent theta tangent theta plus pi take negative angle going get negative tangent go take pi minus angle also going get negative tangent hopefully make little bit useful trying work though trigonometric try find relationship even trying use prove essentially done proven really helpful think within unit circle unit circle tan trig example trigonometry khan academy unit circle tan trig example trigonometry khan academy unit circle tan trig example trigonometry khan academy unit circle tan trig example trigonometry khan academy unit circle tan trig example trigonometry khan academy unit circle tan trig example trigonometry khan academy unit circle tan trig example trigonometry khan academy unit circle tan trig example trigonometry khan academy unit circle tan trig example trigonometry khan academy
