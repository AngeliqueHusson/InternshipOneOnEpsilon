k today going taking go finding inverse function right already lined step follow right first thing going going change f x step number two going switch x going push step solve equation final step would function notation k going implement given function afunction f x equal x minus right step one say change f x thats right going change going replace equal x minus two say switch x left x right going literally switch two x minus right go new equation step three take little effort na sa solve going go equation going attempt solve right first thing want isolate get side say minus opposite would left hand side well right hand side going cross write next line want clean little bit go x plus equal alright still trying solve need opposite see got divided alright opposite dividing would multiplying gon na think going simpler approach multiply sides even though trying solve gon na happen going eliminate fraction multiplying cross son right hand side essence move left hand side alright gon na clean rewrite equation parenthesis x plus parenthesis equal k still trying solve want get one side binomial got set parentheses around multiply sides previous step multiply entire quantity turned tobe binomial divide sides right times binomial want isolate divide x plus x plus right hand side left hand side two binomial sare gon na cross want cleaning little bit equal x plus successfully solve equation fourth step say function notation found function right found inverse original function original function x rewrite function notation need indicate inverse inverse f equal x plus finding inverse function finding inverse function finding inverse function finding inverse function finding inverse function finding inverse function finding inverse function finding inverse function finding inverse function finding inverse function
