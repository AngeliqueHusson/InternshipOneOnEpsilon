last video proved sum positive integer n expressed n times n plus proved induction want video show theres actually simpler proof induction wouldnt included video ill show know induction way prove define function sum positive integer n equal plus plus plus way plus n minus plus n sum integer de fining well rewrite say sum n could rewrite thing could rewrite different order could say thing n plus n minus n minus plus way plus plus actually add two add n plus n going get times sum left also add right sum twice whats interesting going add going add term term term term really trying add two thing sand pick way want add plus n going n plus going add let pink n minus whats plus n minus write plus n minus thing plus n minus thing n plus minus also going n plus term plus n minus n minus thats going n plus going every term way get n minus plus also going n plus finally n plus right plus n plus whats whole sum going well many n plus well n every termin count way n n n n plus add something n times something n times right exactly equivalent n times n plus times sum positive integer sup n going equal n times n plus divide sides get expression sum sum positive integer going equal n times n plus proof didnt use induction really kind pure algebraic proof alternate proof induction integer sum khan academy alternate proof induction integer sum khan academy alternate proof induction integer sum khan academy
