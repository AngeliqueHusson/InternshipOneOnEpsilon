in this video we 're talking about primeand composite numbers and we 're tryingto figure out which of the numbers we'vebeen given our prime numbers and whichones are composite numbers numbers areeither prime or composite they ca n't beboth so what is a prime number and whatis a composite number well a primenumber is a number which is evenlydivisible by only one and itself inother words there 's no number besidesone and the number itself that will goevenly into the number we 've been givenso if we look at this first examplethree we know that one will go intothree because three divided by one isthree that goes in evenly we get a wholenumber answer we also know that three isa factor of 3 because 3 goes into 3evenly one time we get a whole numberanswer when we say 3 divided by 3 we get1 so we know that 1 goes into 3 and weknow that 3 goes into 3 but there are noother numbers that go evenly into 3 ifwe try to divide 3 by any number that'slarger than 3 we 're going to get adecimal answer and if we try to divide 3by a number between its factors forexample try to divide 3 by 2 we 're gonnaget a decimal answer when we 're talkingabout prime numbers and compositenumbers we do n't consider numbers thatare 0 or negative we 're only talkingabout positive whole numbers so the onlyfactors of 3 are 1 & 3 which means that3 is a prime numberwhat about 5 well we know 1 goes into 5evenly 1 will always go into everynumber evenly so that 's a givenwe know that 5 will go into 5 evenlyright the number itself is always gonnago in evenly but what about any othernumbers well the only numbers we have toconsider our numbers greater than 5 andthose are of course always going to giveus a decimal answer and trying to divide5 by any number between its factors here2 3 & 4 will give us a decimal answer sothere are no positive whole numbers thatwill go evenly into 5 other than 1 & 5which means that 5 is also a primenumberwhat about 35 well we know that 1 isgonna go in evenly and we know that 35is gon na go in evenly that 's alwaysgoing to be the case the number one andthe number itself but what about anyvalues between 1 and 35 well we knowthat 5 goes into 35 evenly in fact itgoes in 7 times which means that both 5 & 7 go into 35 evenly so because thereare factors of 35 other than 1 & 35other than 1 and thenumber itself we call this a compositenumber which means that the number hasfactors other than one in itself thatdivide evenly into the number prime and composite numbers (KristaKingMath) prime and composite numbers (KristaKingMath) prime and composite numbers (KristaKingMath)
