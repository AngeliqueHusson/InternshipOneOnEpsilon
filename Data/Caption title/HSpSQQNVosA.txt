alright video want example actually deter mining whether sort complicated product function going even neither remember gave definition even odd little handy dandy kind reference guide kind listing know basically plugging negative x whether get negative original original us even odd know kind refer video suppose want figure secant x times tangent x whether even either going use definition say look f negative x well going us secant negative x negative x remember even odd neither said secant negative x really replace seeking x right say tangent negative x replace tangent negative x negative tangent x well thing everything pull negative back front negative secant x times tangent x well original function secant x times tangent x really negative function know plugged f negative x got negative f x term definition get f negative x start get negative f x would say function turns graph secant x times tangent x going odd function mean graph going symmetric origin example trigonometric function even odd neither example example trigonometric function even odd neither example example trigonometric function even odd neither example example trigonometric function even odd neither example example trigonometric function even odd neither example
