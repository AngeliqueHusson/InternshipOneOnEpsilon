alright in this video I want to do anexample of actually determining whethersort of a more complicated product oftrig functions is going to be even oddor neither so remember we gave thisdefinition of even and odd and I 've madea little handy dandy kind of referenceguide for me kind of listing you knowbasically plugging in negative x andwhether you get the negative of theoriginal or just the original and thattells us that they 're even or odd so I'mgoing to you know kind of refer to thisand this is what we just justified inthe other video so suppose we want tofigure out if secant x times tangent Xwhether that 's even on or either wellokay we 're just going to use ourdefinition and say we 'll have to look atF of negative x well that 's going togive us secant of negative x timestangentof negative X but if you remember interms of these being even odd or neitherwe said that secant of negative X isreally we can replace that with justseeking X all right I 'll do thatand it says tangent of negative x itsays we can replace tangent of negativex with just the negative of tangent of Xwell okay things everything 's just beingmultiplied you can pull the negativeback out front so we have negativesecant X times tangent of X well thevery original function was secant xtimes tangent X so really we have thenegative of that function so we startedwith you know so we plugged out an F ofnegative x we got out negative f of Xand again in terms of our definitions itsays if you get F of negative x if youstart with that and get out negative fof X we would say that function is oddso it turns out that if you graph secantx times tangent xthat 's going to be an odd function andagain that just means when you graph itit 's going to be symmetric about theorigin Examples with Trigonometric Functions: Even, Odd or Neither, Example 2 Examples with Trigonometric Functions: Even, Odd or Neither, Example 2 Examples with Trigonometric Functions: Even, Odd or Neither, Example 2
