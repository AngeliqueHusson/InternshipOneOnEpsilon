g day welcome tech math channel going look video counting principle way counting really really quickly start series going looking permutation pretty much nice mathematical way saying working number different ways thing bear ranged instance many different ways many could combination lock many different ways could lotto come one instance say one two three four book thinking oh many different ways could arrange bookshelf instant food since could put order blue black red green put blue black green red might get red one first black one green one blue one might think well many different permutation start look specifically today counting principle looking going later part going going explain going example start choosing outfit anyway look cupboard first thing look shoe sand trying decide wear black blue next thing going decide color pants gon na wear day funky sort guy green pants also orange next thing side shirt going wear think red shirt blue shirt also black shirt many outfit many different combination wear pants shirt combination could make use counting principle work first going gon na draw tree diagram tree diagram pretty much list possible look different decision make first decision make going wear could either choose id wearing black ugly wearing blue different branch goes next thing decide color pants though might decide going either green one could either wear black black green pants blue pants could use wear orange pants either decision third thing look shirt si could wear three different yeah could wear red shirt could wear blue could wear black tree diagram exactly stuff combination see branch es see many different combination combination combination outfit could wear thinking thats thats pretty handy dandy look pretty funky various might think faster way without drawing tea tree diagram going show two pair two pair pants theyre simple way multiply two times times say instance sudden seven pair pants ill pair choose would go riley drawing one trade would take age honest rather squishy fun draw would go well multiply many different outfit times times together mate combination clothing could wear thats really really easy way could write rule think really probably get get number different combination multiply try menu go restaurant menu menu entree four entree mains main course ten different main dessert two three different type dessert sand ask many different three course could make get work reckon need probably reckon already worked great multiplying think go times times k thats going combination bit harder example say six ill draw one two three four five six get chosen one ball want know many different combination bit harder one way got really good thing driver six different ball choosing drawn six different theres gon na six different multiplying first slot first ball choose bold might think four first ball choose anywhere choose second bowl choose many one ball chosen left theyll next one well next one ball gone ball going next one many different combination might look work going multiply thats lot multiply number five billion million four hundred forty three thousand two one one one bit come come well recently used license like would three letter say letter letter letter around world seen everyone different type license way home could work one license place want know many could mean obviously going affected bit dont like rude word sort deal license going consideration know going p ho anything like many license could might think first one could choose letter letter theres first letter next one could choose letter theres still letter another worried next one could also choose letter letter snow different different work count combination multiply times times times times answer million five hundred seventy six could work license plate however work vary going finish one last thing idea say worried license plate repeat letter every letter number heck unique would work differently huge thing first number came would say number letter took would leave next possibility next one youve got rid two would leave start next one would next time wed work number even though would send multiply see slight variance take billion million anyway hopefully found video informative um fairly intuitive find lot stuff get little bit harder start get harder combination permutation dim sure people going come really gnarly sort question anyway hope found good see next time bye permutation combination counting principle permutation combination counting principle permutation
