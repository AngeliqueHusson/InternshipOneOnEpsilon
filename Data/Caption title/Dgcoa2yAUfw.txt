this video was sponsored by brilliant anan starts at one end of a hugerubberband and starts walking therubberband is 10 meters long in the antwalks one meter per day at the end ofeach day the rubberband stretches by 10meters and the ant moves with thestretch so after the first day therubber band is 20 meters long and theant is 2 meters from the start the antwalks another meter during the secondday getting to 3 meters by the end ofthe day the rubberband then stretchesanother 10 meters growing to 30 meterslong and taking the ant to 4.5 meters 3meters out of 20 stretches to 4.5 out of30 at this rate will the ant ever reachthe end of the rubber band to answerthis question let 's look at a seeminglyunrelated topic the harmonic series thisis the infinite sum 1 plus 1/2 plus 1/3plus 1/4 etc it gets its name from theGreek swear by listening to the pitchproduced by plucking various lengths ofstring Pythagoras found that musicalintervals correspond to the length ofthe string plucked a half length stringproduces a note one octave above theoriginal note a third link produces amusical v above the octave a fourthlength is the fourth above that and afifth length is a major third above thatthese intervals are called naturalintervals and although mathematicallypretty it does n't work well for modernmusic so the harmonic series is the sumof all these string lengths what is thevalue of the sum it 's infinite or as amathematician would say the seriesdiverges there 's an intuitive way toprove this compare the harmonic serieswith the following strictly smallerseries 1 plus 1/2 plus 1/4 plus 1/4 etcso adding the first two terms equals 1plus 1/2 the first four terms make 1plus 2 times 1/2 the first 8 terms make1 plus 3 times 1/2 and in general thefirst two to the N terms make 1 plus ntimes 1/2notice again that this new series isstrictly smaller than the harmonicseries as n becomes large and tends toinfinity so does the sum of the strictlysmaller terms so the harmonic seriesmust diverge as well we can be even moreexact about this divergence if we add upthe first n terms let 's call that H subn the nth harmonic number now look atthe graph of y equals 1 over x from xequals 1 to x equals n draw rectanglesof width one whose upper left cornertouches the graph notice that the heightof these rectangles lines up with theterms from the harmonic seriesin fact the areas of the rectangles are1 times 1 1 times 1/2 all the way up to1 times 1 over n minus 1 so the totalarea of the rectangles is simply the Nminus first harmonic number but a littlecalculus tells us that the area underthe curve 1 over X from x equals 1 to xequals n is log of n this means we canapproximate H sub n very well by log ofn with a little more work H of n isapproximately log of n plus gamma gammais an important constant in mathematicsup there with PI e and P since log of nbecomes arbitrarily large as n tends toinfinity this means that the harmonicseries diverges as well let 's look atsome related infinite series suppose wethin out the harmonic series so that itcontains only the reciprocals of theprime numbers the diversions of theharmonic series can be used to show thatthis thinner series also divergesmoreover the sum of 1 over P for allPrime 's less than n is approximately logof log event for large values of nsimilar to our earlier result with theharmonic numbers what about the sum ofthe reciprocals of squares of positiveintegers this actually converges and thevalue is PI squared over 6 anotherseries is the kempner series which ismade by removing any term from theharmonic series that containsix surprisingly with these terms removedthe Kempner series ends up converging bynow you might see where the original anton a rubberband problem is going thefirst day the ant travels one meter ofthe original 10 meter rubberband thesecond day the ant travels 1 meter on anow 20 meter rubberband but this isequivalent to saying the ant traveledhalf a meter on the 10 meter band thethird day the ant travels 1 meter on a30 meter band but this is equivalent totraveling a third of a meter on theoriginal 10 meter rubberbandso the cumulative distance the ant hastraveled by day n is equivalent totraveling 1 plus 1/2 plus 1/3 plus allthe way up to 1 over N on the originalband but this is the harmonic serieswhich we know diverges so the ant willeventually travel 10 meters and reachthe end of the rubber band equivalentlywe know the ant will reach the end ofthe stretching rubber band since we keptthe ratio of distance traveled the samefor our calculation now the bad news thenumber of days needed is the number nsuch that H sub N equals 10 or roughlylog of N equals 10 so n equals e to the10 a super-scary large number but itworks half faith in the ant you knowbrilliant for its collection
