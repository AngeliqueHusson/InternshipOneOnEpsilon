OhOhOhoh we were born to tackle some wildarithmetic sequences I 'm telling youfolks welcome back and we 're going tojump into a very very special kind ofsequences today well but just some realsolid review here before we get going Iwant to review some terms we want to bevery very very comfortable with and thefirst one says that a sequence all rightis an ordered blank of numbers is inordered what hopefully you can fill inthat last blank for me it 's called anordered list of numbers it 's basicallylike saying 1 comma 4 comma 7 comma 10comma Exedra that 's what we consider tobe a list of numbers numbers that arefollow a pattern hopefully and they'reseparated by commas now the sum of theterms within a sequence is called a whathopefully you 'd just spit out the wordseries so basically if we delete thosecommas and replace them with a plus signand we said 1 plus 4 plus 7 plus 10 plusdot dot now adding those terms togetherwould be called a series now while theseries that exists in the world of mathsome of the series have very randomvalues okay it just looks like peoplejust randomly pulled these numbers outof the thin air while others have a verydefinite pattern and those are the oneswe are concerned with here within ourchapter this year so everything that wedo all the sequences we look at shouldhave a very definite pattern those arethe ones we 're going to look at nowwithin that world of sequences that havedefinite patterns we are going to focusand put a lot of energy into two reallyspecial kinds the first being anarithmetic sequence and that 's whattoday 's lesson is all about soarithmetic is the first kind the secondreally special kind is called ageometric series and not only is thatgoing to be special this year but youcould ask my two students they also dealwith geometric series a lot so it 's areally popular one this year and beyondokay so now we 're going to get in andput all our energy andabout an arithmetic sequence and thisfollowing definition is the mostimportant by far and again I encourageyou if I go too fast just hit that pausebutton and make sure you get the wholething copied down and it really digeststhis definition and to think about itrather than just merely copying thewords down for the sake of getting yournotes done really digest what thisdefinition is say says if a sequencefollows a pattern of adding and writethere 's the key word of the day that'sour buzzword for the day if we 're addinga fixed amount each time from one termto the next it is called an arithmeticsequence alright so this is by far ourmost important definition of the day andwe need to just make sure we get thisentire thing copied down so if we'readding a fixed amount from one term tothe next this is called an arithmeticsequence a good example would be to lookat the sequence that I had written downon the previous slide what you 'll noticehere is to jump from one term to thenext okay if you want to jump from thefirst term to the second term from thesecond term to the third or it 's fromthird to the fourth what kind of patternare you following you 're adding threeeach time to get to the next term so wecould predict that the fifth term wouldbe 13 the sixth term would be 16 and soon and so on and we could continue toperpetuate this pattern more and morenow what we 're adding each time has avery special name okay that fixed amountthat we were adding each time is what wecall quote unquote the common differencenow that sounds a little funny becausedifference implies subtraction and I'mgoing to run out of room so hopefullyyou got that whole word in your notebookbut do n't you agree that the worddifference whenever you see the worddifference you think of subtraction andthat is true I 'm not trying to changethat idea but what we 're doing is you'retaking basically the second term whichup here was the 4 and if you subtractthe first term from it which was your 1what you get is your common differenceall right so a sub 3 minus a some 1 weuse the letter Dokay in the letter D is our symbol or avariable that we 'll use for commondifference and that 's the fixed amountthat we keep adding each time okay let'stake a look at another example and seeif we consider the one on the last slideto be our first example let 's take alook at the sequence 15 comma 10 comma 5comma 0 comma negative 5 comma so I'veshown you the first five terms of asequence and the first thing that I wantyou to do is I want you to readily saythat yes well if that 's the first termand that 's a sub 2 and it 's a sub 3 andit 's a sub 4 and this one 's a sub 5 thisis indeed an arithmetic sequence becausewe are adding a fixed amount each timeand I think this is a really easy one toremember this rule anyway because boththe word arithmetic and the word addingstart with the letter A so that makes itpretty handy to remember and it simplythe question becomes what are you addingto each term well we are adding ok avalue of negative 5 to each term to getthe next term or the shortcut if youever get confused you can always do asub 2 minus a sub 1 which in this caseis 10 minus 15 and you 'll notice we'regetting negative 5 if we were to saypositive 5 we would be incorrect so ourfinal answer is we 're going to say thatde equals negative 5 that 's our commondifference okay our next example I wantto try 1 comma three-halves comma 2comma 5 halves comma 3 there 's yourfirst 5 terms we it is arithmetic againbecause we 're adding a fixed amount eachtime what are we adding well you canalways try a sub 2 minus a sub 1 whichin this case is three-halves minus 1which gives you an answer of 1/2therefore our common difference aka thenumber that we 're adding each time is1/2 now compare that to this series orthe sequence what if I said 1 comma 1/2comma 0 comma negative 1/2 commanegative 1 ok another sequence lookskind of similar now in this particularsituation if I did the second term minusthe first term I get 1/2 minusone with an answer negative 1/2 so inthat case the common difference would benegative 1/2 and it 's very importantthat we get the correct sign in front ofthat number all right before we jumpinto some more examples there 's tworeally important formulas that you needto know all right the first one is whatI call the rule for the nth term okayand there 's others there 's other waysthat we 'll see in the future exampleshow they might word this rule for thenth term all right and this is thereally important one that we have tomemorize we 're going to say that a sub nis equal to a sub 1 plus the commondifference times the quantity n minus 1now when you look at thatjust a few quick clarifications a sub 1represents the very first term in thesequence so that will probably be givento you D represents the commondifference again okay that 's just whatwe 've been talking on the last fewslides that in other words that 's thenumber or the fixed amount that keepsgetting added from term to term nrepresents the number of the I guessthough we 'll call it the number of theterm you 're looking for so if they wantthe fifth term you would just sub simplysubstitute a 5 in for that and then asub n actually represents the termitself not the number of the term butthe term itselfokay so we 'll definitely practice usingthat now before we go any further I wantto introduce you to the second formulathat we 're going to need to know andthis is a called a formula for findingthe sum of a certain number of termsokay the sum of a certain number ofterms and this one looks veryintimidating but I have some good newson this one when I get done writing itso it says S sub n of course S standsfor sum and represents the number ofterms that you want the sum of okay it'sgoing to be n times the quantity a sub 1plus a sub n all divided by 2 and as faras clarification goes S sub n is the sumof the firstand terms okayand of course a sub 1 is the first terma sub n is the last term and itself isthe number of terms that were in thatpattern so we 'll definitely practiceusing that one as well now the good newsis this one right here is going to be onyour reference sheet as opposed to thisone that was up here okaywe really have to memorize this onelet 's put a couple asterisks next tothis one this will be on your nextMonday bite-sized quiz alright this willbe a really important one to memorizeright there okay here 's a really goodexample to get us going herewhat if they presented us with asequence five comma nine comma 13 comma17 dot and they 're simply asking us forto find the rule for the nth term so I'mgoing to do is I 'm just going to refreshmy memory and here 's the formula that Ihad to memorize the nth term is alwaysequal to the whoops I got erased that Iscrewed that up that that needs to be asub one so we 'll be the first term plusthe common difference times the quantityn minus one and so we say the nth termis really the first term which is thefive now the common difference is howmuch you had to add to that five to getto the nine and so I 'm thinking a whileI had to add four so my commondifference is four quantity n minus oneand then what I 'm going to do is I'mjust going to distribute that 4 and thenwe 'll combine like terms all right so wegot four and plus one and this is what Iconsider the rule for the nth term nowsomething that 's kind of worth notinghere do you notice how similar this isthis equals equation for lack of abetter word is to a linear function Iwant you to compare that to y equals MXplus B they 're very very similar thefour matches up with the be the onematches I 'm sorry the four matches upwith the M the one matches up with abeat alright so in other words here 's mylittle shortcut the coefficient of N andthis o is true for only an arithmeticsequence the coefficient of n willalways equal the common differencealright so there 's a little bit of ashortcut for you and that 'll be trueanytime you 're working with anmedic sequence and it 's kind of it hasthe same influence on that formula asthe slope has on a linear function it'svery very very similar idea they'regoing to increase at the same rate termafter term after term okay our secondexample now they 're going to ask me tofind the common difference and whatthey 're giving me is the rule for thenth term they 're going to tell me a subn is equal to 6n plus 3 and there 's areally long way in a really short way todo this problem I 'll do the long wayfirst the first thing you could do isjust start to expand this one out thefirst term substitute a 1 I got 9 thesecond term if I substitute a 2 12 plus3 is 15 so on and so forth and whatyou 'll notice is the difference betweenthose two terms is a 6 so I could saythat the D or common difference is a 6the shortcut is to simply say what wedid on the last slide where thecoefficient of n is guaranteed to be thecommon difference as long as it'sarithmetic and so we could instantly saythat the that coefficient is your Dvalue without showing any work at all aslong as you 're convinced that it'sarithmetic and we 'll talk more later onwhen we start to mix up the differenttypes of sequences how to know whetherit 's arithmetic or not right away butthe long and short of that story is ifit looks like a linear function okay ifit looks like a linear function thenit 's an arithmetic sequence here 's alittle more of a challenging problemthey 're asking me to find the 10th termand then the 100th term if the sequencesays 3 comma 5 comma 7 comma 9 now thoseare the first four terms that were givento us now as far as the 10th term goesthat 's not too hard you could recognizethe pattern the pattern appears to bethat we are adding two each time so thenI could say well let 's see the next termwould be 11 and then 13 and then 15 andthen 17 and then 19 how many is that 1 23 4 5 6 7 8 9 so I need to do one moreterm no turn on to be 21 I could saybingo there is the 10th term so it waskind of annoying but it was n't too badit was very doable now as far as thehundredth term goes you had two choicesyou could use the same technique I justused and keep adding to over and overand over again until you get to thehundredor or you could write the rule for theother term okay and we could justrefresh your memory our new formulalooks like this and then we can simplysubstitute here 's the first term thecommon difference was two and then whatwe could do is simply substitute a 100in for n so we can say a sub 100 isthree plus two times 100 minus one andI 'm going to go nice and slow here we'llsay well that means the 100th term isreally three plus two times 99 let 's seetwo times 99 is going to be oh boy thatone 98 must be so we could safely saythat the one 100th term is going to be201 and that 's what I consider ashortcut as opposed to manually findingeach term all the way until thehundredth term all right ready for ourfourth example here they 're asking me tofind the seventh term if you knew aheadof time that the first term was equal to3x and the common difference was equalto negative x okay is that enoughinformation to help you find the seventhterm well surely it is the rule for thenth term says you want the first termplus the common difference times thequantity n minus 1 and then if you wantthe seventh term all you have to do issubstitute a 7 in for the ends not theaxes the ends and so we clean this up alittle bit let 's say the seventh term isreally let 's see oh I guess I could havecombined the seven and the one rightthere first I was kind of a duhalright I just had a brain fart but itdoes n't make it wrong I guess that givesme an answer of negative 3x so theseventh term would be negative 3x andwhat 's so special I love the M termbecause the nth term gives you theflexibility and the overall freedom togo find any term your heart desires iffor some reason you wanted the 570 thirdterm you could instantly find that witha snap of your fingers by simplysubstituting 573 and for n alright ournext example is going to be by far thehais most challenging one and they'reasking us to find the fifteenth term ifif you knew that the third term a sub 3was equal to negative 4 plus 5i and whatif you knew that the sixth term wasnegative 13 plus 11 I okay so what'sdifferent is if you compare this one tothe last example they gave us the firstterm and the common difference which wasperfect because that 's exactly what Ineed in order to write the formula forthe nth term or the rule for the nthterm now this one was extra hard becausethey did n't give me a sub one or thecommon difference so a little extrachallenging so if I kind of had to makea list of my goals here the first thingI want to do is to try to find thecommon difference and then once I findthe common difference I 'm going to goahead and write my equation or myformula for the nth term all right andthen I can substitute a 15 in for n sothat right here is kind of my game planI 'm gon na try to find D then I 'm goingto write the equation for the nth termand then I 'm gon na substitute 15 friendsounds easy right well I wish it wasthat easy I 'm going to try to give you avisual image you know here 's our firstterm our second term all rightwe know our third term is negative 4plus 5i our fourth term is unknown rightnow our fifth term is unknown but we doknow that our sixth term is whatnegative 13 plus 11 I now here 's whereit gets tricky for now what I 'm going todo is I 'm going to conveniently ignorethose first two terms okay and I 'm goingto put a box around this I 'm going toput all of my energy into thisparticular sequence right here andinstead of calling negative 4 plus 5i onmy third term I 'm going to say that 's myfirst term for right now there 's mysecond term there 's my third term andthere 's my fourth term okay and rememberthat formula a sub N equals a sub 1 plusD quantity n minus 1 what I 'm going todo is I 'm going to say a sub 4equals a sub one plus the commondifference notice I substituted aforward for n so it 's going to look likethis and then I can I could substitutethe negative 13 plus 11 I in for a subfour I can substitute the negative 4plus 5i in for a sub 1 and then if Isimplify 4 minus 1 I get 3d now guesswhat I 'm trying to solve for yaI 'm trying to solve for D and that 's whythis strategy works so nicely I 'm goingto try to add 4 to both sides alrightand that will give me negative 9 I'mgoing to try to subtract 5 from bothsides and that will give me plus 6 Iequals 3 D okay just to recap what I didI added 4 over to the other side andthen I took this 5i and subtracted himover to the other side just kind ofsimplifying like terms there and thenthe last thing I 'm going to do is simplydivide everybody by 3 and I get negative3 plus 2i equals D so that was by farthe trickiest thing that we 're going totalk about today and we 're definitelygoing to reference that little strategytomorrow in class with a few examples sobut we 're not quite done we have to findhow we we formed a little game planearlier in this problem we said we'regoing to find D now once you find Dwe 're now going to write the formula forthe nth term so I could now say that asub n is equal to a sub 1 plus let 's putin parentheses perhaps negative 3 plus2i times the quantity n minus 1 justremember that we just substituted our Dright there and now once we write thenth term they 're now asking me for thefifteenth term I believe let me scrollup and double check before I screw thisup let 's see where 'd that go yesfifteenth term okay so we need to getthe fifteenth term we 're going tosubstitute a fifteen and for this n wecould say a sub fifteen equals a sub onewell actually I want to call a quicktimeout here I want to I 'm going totweek one little thing here for us Iwant to scroll back up just a splitsecond up 15 look at the pattern we hadwe kind of tweaked things a little bitand this is legal as long as we stayconsistentwe kind of deleted this term here inthis term here and we said you know whatlet 's make what they told me was thethird term let 's make that the firstterm and so forth and so forth so if weproject this forward what used to be thefifteenth term is now the thirteenthterm because we deleted these first twoto make our life a little easier soagain this is legal as long as we'reconsistent and we 're going to substitutea thirteen in down here so come on downhere and I apologize for that I justwant to I want to just fix this I thinkthis is the easiest way to do it so thatwhen they say fifteenth term that'sactually the thirteenth term based offof the fact that a sub one is going tobe let 's see what did we said negativefour plus five I was the first term upthere in the red box plus our commondifference of negative three plus 2itimes and then we 're going to substitutethe 13 and for the one alright so we gotour hands full here we 're going to startto clean things up negative 4 plus 5ilet 's see this right here is really a 12so I 'm going to distribute the 12 andget minus 36 plus 24 I combining liketerms oh boy let 's say give me negative40 plus 29 I so it kind of feels likeit 's the 13th term based off of the redbox we had at the top but it 's reallythe 15th term if you included thosefirst two terms so a very tricky exampleI hope you 're able to fight your waythrough that one and we 'll work on thosetogether tomorrowall right ladies a job we 're going tofinish with one more example and theywant me to find the number of terms inthe following sequence we 'll call itseven comma 10 comma 13 comma comma 55that 's a 55 okay period so we have thismysterious number of terms that fallwithin or in between 13 and 55 I don'tknow exactly how many terms fall withinthere and of course there 's a reallylong way if you 're really mentallytough and you could fight your waythrough this you could list out all theterms but I 'm going to try to show youthe most concise shortcut to the answerhere what you do know instantly is youknow the first term is seven you knowthe common difference is three becausethat 's the fixed amount you keep addingto each term and then we know that thenth term or the last term here is a 55the trick is we want to find the valueof n that 's our goal can you find n howmany terms are there in the sequence sorecall our our secret formula for todayall right a sub n is 55 the first termis 7 the common difference is 3 and thenwe have the quantity n minus 1 so atthis point all we 've got to do is try tosolve for n so let 's see 55 equals 7plus 3 n minus 3 we 'll combine the liketerms on the right side that looks like4 plus 3 n we 'll subtract the 4 over andthen we just got 2/3 and I think 3 goesin there 17 times so N equals 17 andwhat we 're trying to say is that if westarted at 7 and went all the way to 55that 's a grand total of 17 terms withinthat sequence alright ladies John hopeyou had a good time let 's memorize thatformula for the nth term of anarithmetic sequence and we will see youtomorrow test
