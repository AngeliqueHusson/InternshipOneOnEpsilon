conditional probability probability looking given one outcome already trying find another outcome imagine running race probability gold giving place top three probability event actually going higher overall without knowing top three could sort realm conditional statement really sort window looking theres formula calculating conditional probability probability b little line basically saying given told event already occur red trying find probability event b happen well probability b given event would probability win gold giving place top three equal probability event probability gold top three probability given probability top three little bit complicated surface really remember formula pretty straight forward actually use sometimes see multiplication multiply sides probability thats end probability times probability b given equal probability b thats perfectly fine multiplication cross multiply statement still true general form conditional probability probably probability b given equal probability b probability conditional probability conditional probability conditional probability conditional probability conditional probability conditional probability conditional probability conditional probability conditional probability conditional probability conditional probability conditional probability conditional probability conditional probability conditional probability conditional probability
