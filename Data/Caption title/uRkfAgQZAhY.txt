that never gets old okay so multiplyingpolynomials is the same as distributiveproperty except it 's a distributiveproperty party it goes like this so ifyou could please write the followingokay so we 're gon na build onto thistruckokay okay distribute this yes5x plus 23 intro and distributivepropertyokay next problem we 're gon na do thesame thing except allow for a littlespace alright I 'll show you what I meanso I know there 's space here but we'regonna pretend there 's no space and we'regonna do distributive property again soimagine like there 's no space you have agood imagination yeah okayvolunteer to distribute this yes xsquared Y a plus 4x x squared plus 4xcorrect the next squared plus 4x goodquestions on this distributed so if youclaim to have a good imagination writethe following next to your X okay thefollowing next your X and with yourstrong imaginations pretend that the Xis no longer there and we 're simplylooking at 6 times X like okay who candistribute this one out please 6x plus24 correct writing that inokay so in other words we distributedthe first X as a next time Zechs in thenext times for that gave us toastthen we distributed the six that 's 6xplus 24 so this is the type of problemswe 're going to be working with todayall right can these be combined in anyway simplification yes what 's gon na beyesx squared plus plus 24 great x squaredplus 10x plus 24 so questions on thatthat 's foiling all right the reason theycall it boil is the following youmultiply the first terms there it isthat 's f here you can even write it hereif you like then you multiply the outerterms that 's here Oh anyone know what Iinner there there 's the inside termsnotice 6 and X are both on the inside somultiply those two that 's I we find theL stands for yes laughs that 's good sothat 's 6 and 4 are both the last termsin these two sequences and that gives us24 and here 's a big hint the oh and theI usually will combine like they do thatthe O and I combined two main tenetsokay let 's tryokay yeah I did sing just not as wellright yeah okayusing your vast knowledge and yourstrong imaginations as we did aboveusing the foil method multiply these twopolynomials so what 's good is thatyou 're doing it and then you want athomes doing this so we can actually worktogether to fix remedial oh okayvolunteer to distribute this first Xmeaning F and oh yes please I 'll be xsquared x squared is x times X plus 4 Xplus 4 X if that is achieved bymultiplying X by 4 okay oh that is doneSusanI am L I am out please I so- 2 X - 8 and do n't be afraid to speakup you 're rightbe proud I 'm right ok catch on fast okso the last step is to simplify themiddle two terms and what are theyx squared plus that 's all it isit 's all it is and what we 're gon na donext is we 're gon na find some patternsabout when you 're multiplying these twosometimes magical things happen I wasn'tmath let 's do that now okay okay saygoodbye test
