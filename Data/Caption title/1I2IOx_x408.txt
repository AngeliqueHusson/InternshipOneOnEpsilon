x equal minus thats less equal negative f x equal plus thats x greater negative ill link actually graph piecewise function another video take look want see graph basically see f x thinking value output like x value thats less equal negative part function equation want use calculate value x greater negative want touse part graph part function piece speak thats works look first one weve got f negative equal blank k let see whatever parentheses see x value input negative less equal negative yes mean want put negative right x thats going negative minus negative thats next one f negative well see negative negative notice equal equal going go first equation place x times negative thats negative minus negative last one f let see x greater negative yes see greater negative mean want second equation right plus thats plus thats answer figure part equation apply part piecewise function evaluate piecewise function evaluate piecewise function evaluate piecewise function evaluate piecewise function evaluate piecewise function evaluate piecewise function evaluate piecewise function evaluate piecewise function evaluate piecewise function evaluate piecewise function evaluate
