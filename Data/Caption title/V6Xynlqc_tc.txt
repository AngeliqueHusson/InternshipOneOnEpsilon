We 're asked to convert these linear equations intoslope-intercept form and then graph them on a singlecoordinate plane.We have our coordinate plane over here.And just as a bit of a review , slope-intercept form is a formy is equal to mx plus b , where m is the slopeand b is the intercept.That 's why it 's called slope-intercept form.So we just have to algebraically manipulate theseequations into this form.So let 's start with line A , so start with a line A.So line A , it 's in standard form right now , it 's 4x plus2y is equal to negative 8.The first thing I 'd like to do is get rid of this 4x from theleft-hand side , and the best way to do that is to subtract4x from both sides of this equation.So let me subtract 4x from both sides.The left hand side of the equation , these two 4x'scancel out , and I 'm just left with 2y is equal to.And on the right-hand side I have negative 4x minus is 8 , or negative 8 minus 4 , however you want to do it.Now we 're almost at slope-intercept form.We just have to get rid of this 2 , and the best way to dothat that I can think of is divide both sides of thisequation by 2.So let 's divide both sides by 2.So we divide the left-hand side by 2 and then divide theright-hand side by 2.You have to divide every term by 2.And then we are left with y is equal to negative 4 divided by2 is negative 2x.Negative 8 divided by 2 is negative 4 , negative 2x minus 4.So this is line A , let me graph it right now.So line A , its y-intercept is negative 4.So the point 0 , negative 4 on this graph.If x is equal to 0 , y is going to be equal to negative 4 , youcan just substitute that in the graph.So 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4.That 's the point 0 , negative 4.That 's the y-intercept for line A.And then the slope is negative 2x.So that means that if I change x by positive 1 that y goesdown by negative 2.So let 's do that.So if I go over one in the positive direction , I have togo down 2 , that 's what a negative slope 's going to do , negative 2 slope.If I go over 2 , I 'm going to have to go down 4.If I go back negative 1 , so if I go in the x directionnegative 1 , that means in the y direction I go positive two , because two divided by negative one is still negativetwo , so I go over here.If I go back 2 , I'm going to go up 4.Let me just do that.Back 2 and then up 4.So this line is going to look like this.Do my best to draw it , that 's a decent job.That is line A right there.All right , let 's do line B.So line B , they say 4x is equal to negative 8 , and youmight be saying hey , how do I get that into slope-interceptform , I do n't see a y.And the answer is you wo n't be able to because you this can'tbe put into slope-intercept form , but we can simplify it.So let 's divide both sides of this equation by 4.So you divide both sides of this equation by 4.And you get x is equal to negative 2.So this just means , I do n't care what your y is , x is justalways going to be equal to negative 2.So x is equal to negative 2 is right there , negative 1 , negative 2 , and x is just always going to be equal tonegative 2 in both directions.And this is the x-axis , that 's the y-axis , Iforgot to label them.Now let 's do this last character , 2y is equal tonegative eight.So line C , we have 2y is equal to negative 8.We can divide both sides of this equation by 2 , and we gety is equal to negative 4.So you might say hey , Sal , that does n't look like thisform , slope-intercept form , but it is.It 's just that the slope is 0.We can rewrite this as y is equal to 0x minus 4 , where they-intercept is negative 4 and the slope is 0.So if you move an arbitrary amount in the x direction , they is not going to change , it 's just going tostay at negative 4.Let me do a little bit neater.y is just going to stay at negative 4.Or you can just interpret it as y is equal to negative 4 nomatter what x is.So then we are done .
