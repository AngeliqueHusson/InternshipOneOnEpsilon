our last video explained the famousMonty Hall problem and from what I cantell reading your comments there arethree types of people here those whounderstand the problem or even betterwere helped by our video those who stilljust do n't get it and those who areabsolutely adamant that we got it wrongbut one thing everyone has in common itseems is a desire to discuss and explainhow they see the problem I 'm nodifferent so what I 'd like to do now isquickly recap what the Monty Hallproblem is and then explain to you how Isee itso we have these three doors one hidesthis shiny red sports car the other twohave these worthless goats you thecontestant choose a door let 's choosedoor one in this example the gameshowhostsMonty Hall himself who knows what'sbehind each door is then forced toreveal a goat from behind one of the tworemaining doors you 're then given achoice to stick or switch with two doorsremaining it seems some of you thinkthis has become a 50/50 choice stick orswitch it does n't really matter thereare two doors one 's got the car and onedoes n't but that 's not true and yourbest chance of winning is to switch nowthe reason for this is an important factthat I can not emphasize enough MontyHall the host knows what 's behind allthe doors and he 's forced to show you agoat from behind one of those tworemaining doors after your first choicethis is very important there isinformation here that 's about to be putinto the system let me explain whathappens when you made that first choicethere was a 1 in 3 chance that the carwas behind your door surely we agreehere now in that situation Monty had twogoats he could have revealed to you frombehind these other two doors now that'snot very helpful and of course if youthen switched like I tell you you shouldyou 'd have moved away from the car andlost I 'm sorry I just lost your sportscar I apologize but let 's be honestthere was only a one in three chance ofthat happening let 's wipe the slateclean or the brown paper clean and nowthis time let 's imagine your firstchoice was that dreaded goat now this istwice as likely there 's a two in threechance that this is what you 've done weagree on that right two and three chanceyou 've chosen a goat so this scenario ofcourse should be of more interest to usit 's the more likely scenario and thistime you have forced Monty 's hand heknows where the one remaining goat is heknows it and he has to show it to you inthis case in two thirds of the games youever play he is indirectly telling youexactly where the car is it 's herebehind the door he did n't open let mesay that again in two thirds of thegames Monty can only open one doorbecause he knows and therefore youshould know the car is behind the otherone and because you notice you shouldswitch now you do n't know for sure thishas happened there 's a one in threechance this has n't happened but there'sa two in three chance it has happenedit 's more likely to have happened it'smore probable so there you go switchswitch probability tells you to switchand this is because of Monty 's knowledgeif Monty did n't know what was behind thedoor was this would be completelydifferent then after his big revealyou 'd be none the wiser and the oddswould indeed be fifty-fifty you may aswell stick but it 's also worth noting inthat case a third of the time Montywould accidentally open a door thatreveals a car that 's not the game we'replayingMonty knows where everything is andwo n't reveal the car that 's the rulesMonty has the knowledge and thereforeyou have the knowledge and knowledge asthey say is power leave a comment Monty Hall Problem for Dummies - Numberphile Monty Hall Problem for Dummies - Numberphile Monty Hall Problem for Dummies - Numberphile
