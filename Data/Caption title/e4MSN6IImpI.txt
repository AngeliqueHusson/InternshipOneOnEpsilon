OK , let 's say you 're me , and you 're in math class.You 're supposed to be learning about exponential functions , but you 're having trouble caring about exponential functionsbecause , unfortunately , your math class is probably notterribly engaging.You 're supposed to be drawing and labeling some axesso that you can graph this y equals 2 to the x thing.And your teacher seems to think that drawing and labeling axesis the very essence of mathematics.But you 're bored and can't help but wonder , why ? So you do what any conscientious studentwould do in this situation and start doodling.And because you 're me , you like to play games with yourselfwhen you doodle.Here 's one game.You 're drawing a line.But when it crosses one of the blue linesone your little piece of paper , it splits into two lines.Maybe this line is like the neck of a mythical hydra , whereevery time one of its heads gets chopped off by a blue line , it grows two more in its place.You want to see if you can get all the wayto the bottom of the page following this rulebecause , if you do , then you can draw all of the little hydraheads at the end.But you do n't get very far on your first try.You decide to try again , this time spacing things outa little more at the beginning.Unfortunately , things are fillingup fast , though you got farther than last time.Maybe if you have more room , or maybeif you sharpen your pencil more , youcan get to the bottom of the page.Oh , and do n't forget to draw and label your axes.If each broad swing of Hercules 's sword chopsoff all the heads , that's doubling your number.Well , you can see where I 'm going.I 'm not going to try and teach you math , just how to wield it for doodling purposes.In this case , that 's going to be a lot of heads.Good luck Hercules.But maybe drawing binary trees all straight like thatis not an interesting enough gameto hold your attention for long.So you start drawing them in arbitrary shapes.Or less arbitrary shapes.Maybe you start drawing a binary tree that looks like a tree.And maybe you ca n't see this tree in very high qualitybecause your camera , much like your math class , is fuzzy , unfocused , and altogether not very good.Maybe you change the rules slightlyand make a ternary bush , where each branch sprouts three morebranches.Unfortunately , your math class is 45 minutes long , and soon you need a more interesting doodle game.So you go back to the game where your line splitsat every level , only this time , insteadof trying to squish all the lines in , you let them hit each other.And when they crash , there 's a fiery explosion , and the crashing lines end.There.Maybe you turn your notebook sidewaysso that you can make sure you're getting the horizontal spacingright.Maybe , to go back to mythology , Herculeshas a method where , instead of cauterizingthe necks of the Hydra to keep them from growing back , he 's found that the necks stick together if they get too close.And instead of growing new heads , they just fill up with blood.It might seem a little morbid for math class , but maybe if the curriculum was n't so appalling , and the teaching methods were n't so atrocious , you would n't have to entertain yourselfwith these stories and games.Speaking of this doodle game , something very interestingis happening.Looks like your simple rules about splitting and crashingare creating Sierpinski 's triangle , which is a pretty awesome fractal.But the point is not to learn about fractals , or cellular automata , or Sierpinski , but to show that simple doodle games canlead to mathematical results so cool and beautifulthat they 're famous.At least , famous to people like me.And if you 're good at inventing doodle games , you might even end up doing some real mathematicsduring your math class.Anyway , maybe you don't care about accuracy.Maybe you try the game again , onlyyou do n't keep track of spacing , and when you make a mistakeand accidentally grow heads where you should n't , you justroll with it.Now you 've introduced an element of random error , and you want to know how this will affect the final picture.It still looks like a pretty awesome doodleand has many of the same elements , though it lacks the structure.Speaking of the structure , maybe because you 're really , superbored , and your class is seemingly never going to end , you start looking at the number of necks at each leveland trying to figure out the pattern.Maybe you have n't forgotten about powers of two.Anyway , I hope I've provided you with somethingentertaining to do next time you 're bored.Good luck with your math class . test
