I want to take the look at theparticular transformation called thereciprocal transformation given thegraph of a function y equals f of X whatdoes the graph of y equals 1 over f of Xlook like to figure that out I want tostart with a simple example let 's usethe graph of y equals 1 minus 1/2 X tograph y equals 1 over 1 minus 1/2 Xfirst thing I want to do is graph yequals 1 minus 1/2 X and that 's prettyeasy alright this is gon na be a linewith y-intercept 1 and slope negative1/2 so it 's gon na go down 1 over 2 andright away when you have two points fora line you can graph the lineimmediately so that 's our line now howdo we get points for this graph 1 overthat well you can just take reciprocalsright for example this point has ay-coordinate of 1 the reciprocal of 1 is1 so the reciprocal graph will passthrough this point this point has ay-coordinate of 1/2 the reciprocal ofthat is 2 so it 's gon na the thereciprocal grapple pass through thispoint let 's pick a nice integer herewe 're gon na have a y-coordinate of 2 sothe reciprocal will have a y-coordinateof 1/2 here we have a y-coordinate of 3the reciprocals 1/3 and you can kind ofsee what 's gon na happen as the graphgoes up to infinity the reciprocal goesdown to 0 and we get this kind of shapenow what happens passed here notice thatthe Y values of my my line are gettingclose to 0 well let 's take a table ofvalues I 've got X 1 minus 0.5 X + 1 over1 minus 0.5 X let 's let X get closer andcloser to 2 and see what happens as weget close to this point so we 've alreadydone x equals 1 let 's do one25 now half of 1.5 is 0.75 and 1 - thatis 0.25 the reciprocal of 1 of 0.25 is 4okay so it 's going up with if we wantedto we could plot that point it would beup here 1.9 half of that is 0.95 1 minus0.9 5 is 0.05 and the reciprocal of thatis 20 you might be able to tell alreadythat as these numbers get closer to 2these numbers are going to get closer to0 and these numbers are going up toinfinity so that 's what our graph isgoing to do as we get close to 2 thisgraph is going to move up to infinityall right that means that we have avertical asymptote at x equals 2 let medraw that in it 's a vertical line avertical line that the graph is going toget closer and closer to as it moves upnow what happens on this side again wecan just plot plot some points like onthe line at this x value which lookslike 4 we 're gon na have negative 1 thereciprocal of negative 1 is negative 1so my reciprocal graph will actually gothrough that point here the Y value isnegative 1/2 the reciprocal that'snegative 2 so we 'll go through thispoint and well let 's say here at 3 wehave 3 halves the reciprocal of that is2/3 and you can see that we 're gon na geta similar graph a similar kind of graphdown here is up here now is this gonnahappen as X approaches 2 from the rightare we going down to negative infinitylet 's checks really quickly with somevalues to point 5half of that is 1.25 1 - 1 point 2 5 isnegative 0.25 and the reciprocal ofthat 's negative 4 so this is 1 over 1minus 0.5 X what about 2 point 1 half ofthat is 1.0 5 1 minus that is minus 0.05and the reciprocal that 's negative 20 soyeah you can see that as this goes to 24 approaching 2 from the right this isapproaching 0 this is going to negativeinfinity that that verifies that thegraph should actually just go downstraight down to negative infinityso we 've got a vertical asymptote xequals 2 and you might also recognizethat the x-axis is a horizontalasymptote right the graph is gettingcloser and closer to it as X goes toinfinity or as X goes to negativeinfinity so this purple graph is a graphof my reciprocal function y equals 1over 1 minus 0.5 X and the red graph isa graph of my original line y equals 1minus 0.5 X test
