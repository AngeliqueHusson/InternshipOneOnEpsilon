DR. JAMES GRIME : So I 've got a very big number to show youtoday used by NatWest Bank so that you can send them yoursecret bank details.It starts 2 3 4 5 3 6 7 6 2 8 -- [ MULTIPLE CLIPS OF NUMBERS BEINGCOUNTED AT THE SAME TIME ] -- 7.Did you get that , or do you want me to repeat it ? So this number that we are reading outis 617 digits long.All banks have similar numbers when you want to send themyour credit card details.This is not a secret number.In fact , your computer will download this number when itwants to send your credit card details.It 's there to find.This is public.So this code that they use on the internet is called RSA.It 's named after the three people who came up with it , who were Rivest , Shamir , Adleman.Should I show you how it works ? BRADY HARAN : Please.DR . JAMES GRIME : All right.Imagine if you had a secret that you wantedto send to the bank.So the bank provides you with a box , and it provides youwith a key to lock the box.So you can put your secret inside and you can lock it , and then you can send the secret to the bank.That 's good , is n't it ? But the problem is that the bank is giving everyone one ofthese boxes and a key that goes with it , and that meansthat , well , one person could steal someone else 's box anduse the key to unlock it and read their secrets.That would be terrible.We ca n't do that.So what the banks do , same sort of idea but instead ofgiving out keys , they give out padlocks.So they give everyone a box.You 've got a secret.Put it inside the box.Lock it not with a key but with a padlock.It goes click.It 's snapped shut.Once it 's locked and snapped shut , you do n't have thepadlock key , so you ca n't reverse it.You ca n't open it up.So if someone steals your box , they don'thave the key either.They 've got padlock , but they do n't have thekey to open the padlock.The only person that does is the bank themselves.And it 's a way to send secret messages without having tosend out the keys.It 's easy to lock the code , but it 's hardto unlock the code.First of all , I have to explain this with the smallestexample I can , and then I'll show you why we use thatmassive number.Let 's say you 're the bank and you give out two numbers.They 're public , so everyone can know them.They 're not secret numbers.I 'm going to choose the number 3 and the number 10.The bank also has a secret number.The bank secret number , for now , you don'tknow what it is.No one knows what it is.Only the bank knows what that secret number is.I had a very bad breakfast this morning , so I 'm going tosend the message BAD CHEF.The first thing you do if you have a message like that is toturn the letters into numbers.That 's quite simple.A is 1 , B is 2 , and Z is 26.Simple stuff.C is 3 , D is 4.Now I 'm going to turn it into a code , and I 'm going to usethe number 3.Now there are some codes that would just add 3 , or there aresome codes that would multiply by 3.What we 're going to do is raise to the power 3 , so we'regoing to cube these numbers here.Let 's do that.So I get 2 cubed , which is 8.1 cubed , which is 1.5 cubed is 125.And 6 cubed , 216.The final step is to use the second number , the number 10.I 'm going to divide by 10 , and I 'm goingto look at the remainder.So if I take something like 512 , when I divide by 10 , itwould be 51 10's and 2 leftover.So that 's just 2.5 here , 1 and 4.And that 's your code.And that 's what you would send.The bank , or the person who is going to decode this message , has a secret number.Now the secret number in this example is going to be 3.There 's a formula to work out the secret number.I 'm going to gloss over that for a second , but I 'm going toshow you what to do next to decode the message.This is my code.I 'll write it out again.I 'm going to do the same thing I did before.This time I 'm going to use my secret number.It does n't have to be the same as 3 , but it just happens tobe the same as the 3 we used before.But nevermind , it doesn't have to be.But I 'm going to cube again.So I cube these numbers.We do like we did before.We divide by 10 , and find the remainder.And then the decoder will turn that into letters , which is B , and he gets the message back again , BAD CHEF.Now that 's just a taste of how it works.That 's the process that your computer does every time youbuy something on Amazon or eBay.One of the important numbers in this code was this 10.Now this 10 was made by multiplying twoprime numbers together -- 2 times 5 are prime numbers.Multiply them together and you get 10.Now that massive number that I showed you that NatWest usesis the same idea.It 's two massive prime numbers multiplied together.That 's what it is.If you want work out the decode key , the secret key , you need to know the original prime numbers.Now the only way a spy , someone who wants to break thecode , could work out the original prime numbers is totake that massive number and factorize it -- turn it back , break it up into the original two prime numbers.This is really hard.So hard that it 's impractical to break with moderntechnology.The massive number I showed you was a 2,048-bit number.That means it 's about 2 to the power 2,048.Now about a decade ago , we did manage tobreak 512-bit numbers.We were able to take that number and factorize it intoits original primes.A few years ago , a team of academics managed to break the768-bit number.It took this team of academics with all their resources twoyears to break at 768-bit key.And they said that to break what we use now , which isabout 1,024 , would take thousands of times longer.But given the speed of technology , they reckon thatthis sort of code , 1,024-bit , could be broken within a fewyears , they said.They said that a few years ago.So this should now start to be replaced.Gmail still uses this , but this should be replaced.And as you can see , NatWest have done that.All the banks have done that.They are now using 2,048-bit number , which again would takecomputers -- and I mean even with a proper attack -- big computers , it would still take them thousands of yearsto factorize that number into its original prime number.Now hidden in the details for this code is a mathematicalfact that was worked out in the 17th centuryby Pierre de Fermat.He 's famous for Fermat's Last Theorem.Well , this was Fermat's Little Theorem.If I take a number , a whole number , aninteger , any number -- call it x.I 'm going to raise it to a power.And it 's going to be a prime number , so p for prime.I 'm going to raise it to a power , and I 'm going totakeaway x.This is a multiple of p , the prime number.Let me do an example.What I mean is if you took a number like 4 , and then I tooka prime number like 5 , and then I takeaway 4 , I would get4 to the power 5 , which is 1,024 , takeaway 4 , which is 1,020.And that is a multiple of 5 , but that would be guaranteed.You 're guaranteed to have a multiple of 5.Now you can imagine that in the 17th century when Fermatcame up with this factor , people said , well , very nicemathematical fact , but that's pretty useless.What use are you going to have for that ? And then suddenly the internet comes along , and it'smassively useful.In fact , our whole modern world depends on this fact.So to use this code , the public key has two numbers.I 've shown you the massively long one that NatWest uses.The other number that we need , which is the power that youhave to raise , that is not as big.That is 65,537.Quite a big number.When you compare it to the second number , it 's small.BRADY HARAN : If you 're in the mood for even more about banksand really big numbers , then check out my latest video fromthe Chemistry Channel Periodic Videos , where we 've beeninside the Bank of England gold bullion vault , where theyhave a couple hundred billion pounds worthof gold lying around.That 's not something you see every day.The link is here on the screen and below the video .
