I , Carlo S¨¦quin , will prove to you that any triangle that you draw is equilateral.That means it has the same length of the sides all around.So I 'm starting with three intersecting lines , and a second one here , and a third one here , and I mark the intersection vertices as the vertices of a triangle : A , B , and C.That does not look , you know , equilateral ( not too far off ) , but it is certainly arbitrarily drawn.Now , I 'm taking the middle point of the side BC ( I call this M ) , and I draw the perpendicular bisector.So I 'm drawing a line that 's perpendicular , coming out of M , going off in that particular direction.And , of course , we have a right angle here.Now you know that this line is the locus of all the pointsthat are equidistant from point B and from point C.I 'm going to draw another extra line , and that is the angle bisector coming out of A here , So that should look something like that , I guess.and this line , of course , let 's call it angle divider `` d '' , is the locus of all the points that are equidistant from lines AB and from line AC.So , If I 'm going to the intersection point between these two lines , which is about here , which I 'm calling X , then I know that this point is equidistantfrom B and from C , because it lies on the perpendicular bisector.So , let 's draw these two lines.And we know that these are equal because they are on the perpendicular bisector.Okay , But also , If I draw the shortest distance from X to line AB , Which might look something like that , And comes in , of course , at a right angle here.and I draw the shortest distance from X on to line AC , and has a right angle here.Let 's call this point B* , and let 's call this point C* , then I know that XB* is equal to XC*because they 're on the angle bisector , and these are all the points that are equidistant from those two lines.Okay.Now , we focus on these two small triangles.And here , we have a triangle with a right angle ; adjacent to the right angle we have this double-marked line , XB*.And here we have a right angle ; and adjacent to the right angle we have this double-marked line , XC* ; And we know these two lines are the same length.We also have the third side of a triangle which is opposite of the right angle , marked with this one slash , and it is the same as this slash over here , ( that 's the hypotenuse in this case ) And so , because two triangles have two equal sides , and they have the longer side being opposite to an angle that also happens to be equal , then these two triangles are congruent.As a matter of fact , in this case , we can see they 're basically mirror images of one another.Now , this of course tells us that , we also now know that , BB*BB* must be equal toBB* must be equal to CC*.BB* ( I 'll mark it with three slashes ) BB* is equal to CC*.Now , we have more congruent triangles.We also have the triangleWe also have the triangle AWe also have the triangle AXWe also have the triangle AXB*We also have the triangle AXB* , being a mirror image ofWe also have the triangle AXB* , being a mirror image of AXC*And so those two triangles are congruent.And this , of course , tells us thatAB* equals to AC*Okay ! Now , what can we conclude from all that ? Well , we can say thatAB* minus BB* is really just the side AB.And we can say thatAC* minus CC* is just the side AC.Now we 're almost there.We have proven up here that AB* is equal to AC* , we have proven that BB* is equal to CC* , and so these two sides being equal , it essentially then follows that AB equals AC.So , we have done nothing special about the triangleand we have now proven that these two sides are of equal length . ( From the background ) So we 've got an isosceles triangle ? That 's right.And now or course , I can go around and do exactly the same constructionon two other sides , making this what was A before , and proving that these two sides are the samewith the same construction hanging off to this side.I do n't have to do it a third time , becauseonce I 've proven that , I can really show that all sides of this triangle are of equal length.I can just start from another vertex , draw my angle bisector , do my perpendicular bisector over there anddo exactly the same construction.So , you of course know that this can not possibly be true , and so I encourage you to go very carefully , step-by-step , through here.and try to find out , you know , where is that one bogus step ?
