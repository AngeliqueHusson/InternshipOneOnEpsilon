perpendicular bisector theorem is usedin many congruence proofs and is alsovery simple to understand but let 's seewhat a perpendicular bisector actuallyis say we have a line segment a B withline L as its perpendicular bisector ifthis is true then line L will intersectthe segment at a right angle and we'lldivide the segment into two equal partsif the perpendicular bisector intersectsthe segment a B at Point P then a P willbe equal to P B what does theperpendicular bisector theorem saythough take any random point C whichlies on line L the distance of point Cfrom the endpoints of segment a B willalways be equal this distance will equalthis distance in this case AC willsurely be equal to BC say we haveanother point D on line L then thislength will equal this length that is adwill equal BD even if we have point Eunder the line like this then these twolengths will be equal a e will be equalto B e in short each point on theperpendicular bisector is equidistantfrom points a and B but why is this truewe will see its proof in the next videoyou test
