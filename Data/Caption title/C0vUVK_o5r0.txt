whereas to find the height of thetriangle pictured above if the area isequal to 18 square units the areaformula for a triangle is area equalsone-half base times height where for thepictured triangle this side is the basewhich has a length of six units and thislength is the height which is unknownlet 's go ahead and label this side B forbase and this length H for height andbecause we know the area of the trianglewe can use the area formula to set up anequation and solve for H and sometimeswe 'll see the area formula written asbase times height divided by two becausedividing by two is equivalent tomultiplying by one half but we 'll goahead and use this form of the areaformula so the area is equal to 1/2times the base which is 6 units timesthe height which is unknown which weknow must be equal to 18 and now we needto solve this equation for H byisolating H on one side of the equationlet 's first simplify the left side 1/2times 6 or 1/2 of 6 is equal to 3 andtherefore the left side simplifies to 3H so we have 3 H equals 18 if we need toshow some work here we could write 6 asa fraction with the denominator of 1 andthen simplifying before multiplying wehave a common factor of 2 between thenumerator denominator there 's one twoand two and three twos and sixthis product is 3h and because 3h means3 times H in order to solve for H weneed to undo this multiplication bydividing both sides by 3so dividing by 3 undoes multiplying by 3so the left side is H or 3 divided by 3is 1 1 times H is H on the right side wehave 18 divided by 3 which equals 6 sonow I know the height of the triangle isequal to 6 unitsthe triangle has a base of 6 units and aheight of 6 units the area will be 18square units I hope you found thishelpful Ex: Find the Height of a Triangle Given Area (Even Base) Ex: Find the Height of a Triangle Given Area (Even Base) Ex: Find the Height of a Triangle Given Area (Even Base)
