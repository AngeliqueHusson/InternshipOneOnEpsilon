hello this videos is the quick refresheron how to convert between the units usedwhen measuring distance so we 'll getstraight into itwith Whistler mafia millimeterscentimeters meters and kilometers theyhow to convert between there 's morefirst off I destroyed a few of ERconversion facts there are tenmillimeters in one centimeter there area hundred centimeters in one meter thereare thousand meters in one kilometerokay so how do we convert between thesewell first off I 'll consider meters tokilometers okaynow I 'll write this down in onekilometer there is the thousand metersso to getto convert between meters and kilometersto convert between this one here whichis a thousand to get the number one whatI have to do is I have to divide by athousand convert between kilometers andmeters well to get from one to athousand I multiplyfive thousand so two thousand meters askilometers or two thousand divided by athousand would give me two kilometersand three kilometers say or four or sofour kilometers as meters or four timesa thousand would give us four thousandokay so that 's that onethe next one will consider is convertingbetween meters and centimetersokay sofirst off there is a hundred centimetersin one meter so to convert between theseso to get from centimeters to meters toget from a hundred to one what we havedone is we divide by a hundred okayso one hundred centimeters divided by100 equals one meter so 400 centimeters400 divided by a hundredwe give us four meters and to convertand answer that is meters intocentimeterswe do the opposite three times by 100okay seven meters times 100 would giveus seven hundred centimeters okay nextoff will consider converting centimetresto millimetres okay so in one centimeterthere 's ten millimeters so to convertbetween theseafter you have centimetres tomillimetres from say one centimeter to10 millimeters we times by 10 and sayokay so 7 centimeters 7 times 10 is thesame as saying 70 millimeters all rightand you get between 4 millimeters tocentimeters we divide by 10 okay 90millimeters 90 divided by 10 is the sameas 9 centimeters okay so what we havehere is a nice little table a little barchart which allows us to convert betweenall the units of R which we use inmeasuring distancein order to convert between these unitsthe easiest way which I 'd find to do itis because these numbers are like a tena hundred a thousand then we 're dealingwith basically all it involves is movinga decimal place a lot at the time andI 'll show you what I mean by thisokay so say what I want to convert Istart off with one it 's a little bitmore difficult so I want to convertseven meters into kilometers and to getfrom meters to kilometerswhat I dois always guythis way okay so I divide by a thousandnow I get my calculator out now a 7/8affairs and I 'd get whatever answer Iget but I 'll show you what I mean bymoving in decimal place now because I'mdividing this number is going to getsmaller so the decimal place is going tomove that way as you 're probably wellaware there 's a decimal place afterthat 's seven at the moment how manytimes do I move itwell there 's one two three zeros when Idivide by thousand so that 's how manytimes I move it for one two threedecimal place ends up herewrite that in blue and the answerbecomes point zero zero seven okay soseven meters is the same as point zerozero seven kilometers I 'll go throughanother oneokay how about this one 9.2 kilometersbecausehow many millimetersokay so to do this let 's think aboutwhat we have to do we go from Palmadoorstwo millimeters so what we 're doing isfirst we 're gon na get a number in thetimes of by a thousand times then answerby hundred and times then answer by 10so this 9.2 here the answer is going toget bigger the numbers going to bebecause we 're time T okay so how manytimes do I have to move this decimalplace here well let 's count it one twothree four five six times the answer isgetting bigger so test one place itagain this way it 's moving six times onetwo three four five sixand we put zeros yeahokay so 9.2 km/h as millimeters goes isnine million two hundred thousandmillimeters okay we 'll give anotherexample agookay what I want to know is 90millimetersor know what that isas it matters okay so how many Mainersso let 's work this outwhat we 're doing is we go frommillimeterstwo meters so we 're going dividing 90 by10 and then we can divide by 100 okay somy 90 here with the decimal place here Ihave to move the decimal place becauseI 'm dividing and I was going to getsmaller destiny and it 's going to movethis way the decimals and I have themoment one two three times a card wascounting the number of zeros so one twothree up a zero there all right 90millimeters equals zero point zero ninezero literswhat about one final example okay whatabout four point three eight kilometersequals how many centimetersokay okay it 's get between these let'shave a look so we going from kilometersand we 're moving to centimeters so we'regoing to divide and four points rightfirst we 'll get a times 5,000 and thenwe have the times 500 because we'retiming the number is going to get biggerall right all right we 4.38 here andI 'll count how many times I have to movethis decimal place one two three fourfive so one two three four five and I'llput some zeroes thereokay I 'll get rid of that decimal placeso in four point three eight kilometersthere is four hundred and thirty eightthousand centimeters okay nice now whatI really recommend with this you reallyshould know how to convert between thisthis is one of these fundamental thingswith math so you really should be ableto do however what I 'd recommend is ifyou 're stuck doing it the first thingthe bottom the bottom line and mostbasic things you should know is thatthere are ten millimeters in onecentimeter that there are a hundredcentimetersin one manner there are a thousandmeters in one kilometerfrom this you should then be Autoattempt to drawa diagram like we have here okayand in that same method that wouldshould we did before using this youshould be adding convert between meterskilometers centimeters millimeterswithout really that much of a problemthe way might I 'd recommend especiallywe doing a building Trotter somethinglike that to be able to convert betweenis millimeters and meters we 're okay togo from meters to millimeters all uptyping by 110 so it 's a thousand so youget use this conversion with thousand inbetween each time anywayI hope you get really good at these goodluck with that they kept by Converting distance
