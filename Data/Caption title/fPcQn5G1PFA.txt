welcome lesson interior exterior angle triangle goal define interior exterior angle triangle also state several theorem exterior angle triangle interior angle triangle triangle formed sides triangle angle one two three interior angle triangle vertices point sides triangle meet vertices b cand vertex singular vertices vertex vertex b vertex c exterior triangle angle form linear pair interior angle extending sides triangle actually two set exterior upon sides extend mean take look vertex c notice triangle left extended side b c vertex cand notice triangle extended vertex c continue pattern think going counterclockwise extension clockwise angle one two three interior angle angle four five six would exterior angle triangle notice form linear pair interior angle sand looking triangle angle four five six would exterior form linear pair interior angle sit really n matter sides extend angle four congruent angle four angle five congruent angle five angle six congruent angle six let take look couple example want determine measure indicate couple thing remember first sum interior triangle always one hundred eighty degree sand know also know exterior linear pair interior angle looking angle two know measure angle two plus one hundred thirty eight equal one hundred eighty degree form linear pair subtract one hundred thirty eight sides equation know measure angle two must forty two degree sand similar way measure angle one plus ninety four equal one hundred eighty subtract ninety four sides measure angle one degree sand looking interior angle know measure angle one plus measure angle two plus measure angle three must equal one hundred eighty degree well measure angle one eighty six degree measure angle two forty two degree n know measure angle three know sum one hundred eighty eighty six plus forty two one hundred subtract one hundred twenty eight sides measure angle three would give us fifty two degree sand determine measure angle four know angle three angle four form linear pair one hundred eighty fifty two degree give us measure angle four one hundred twenty eight take moment sum exterior triangle ninety four degree one hundred twenty eight degree one hundred thirty eight going twenty carry two going eleven thirteen sixteen carry one three hundred sixty degree notice interior exterior angle formed three three times one hundred eighty degree would give hundred forty degree subtract sum angle always one hundred eighty degree would get three hundred sixty match es sum exterior come back idea later video let take look another example go little bit quick er know interior exterior angle linear pair therefore sum would one hundred eighty one eighty minus one twenty four going give us fifty six degree angle one hundred eighty degree minus ninety five degree eighty five degree sand know sum interior angle going one hundred eighty degree fifty six degree plus eight five degree gong one hundred forty one one eighty minus one forty one going give us thirty nine degree angle one two form linear pair one eighty minus thirty nine going give us one hundred forty one degree angle let talk couple theorem involve exterior angle prove next couple sum exterior angle triangle well polygon always three hundred sixty trying point ear lier know interior exterior three linear pair therefore sum angle one six would one hundred eighty degree times three five hundred forty degree sand also know sum interior angle triangle one hundred eighty degree take five hundred forty degree subtract one hundred eighty degree always hundred sixty degree sum exterior angle triangle always hundred sixty degree also true polygon talk last theorem let define remote remote angle two angle triangle adjacent angle specific exterior angle pick one exterior angle let say angle two interior angle adjacent angle one would angle two angle three angle two angle three remote angle one angle special relationship exterior angle sum remote interior angle equal nonadjacent exterior angle angle one angle two three remote angle measure angle two plus measure angle three equal measure angle one let talk call angle four measure angle one plus measure angle four equal one hundred eighty also know sum interior angle one hundred eighty know measure angle two plus measure angle three plus measure angle four equal one hundred eighty degree swell solve first equation measure angle one measure angle one one hundred eighty degree minus measure angle solve equation measure angle two plus measure angle three would thing one hundred eighty degree minus measure angle four conclude measure angle one equal measure angle two plus measure angle three take look formal proof two theorem next two watching introduction interior exterior angle triangle introduction
