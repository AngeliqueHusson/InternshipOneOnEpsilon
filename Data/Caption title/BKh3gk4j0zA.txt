g'day welcome to Tech math Channel whatwe 're going to be having a look at inthis video is a method of working out awhole bunch of things ratios rightspercentages currency conversions it'scalled the box method so I 'll show youhow to do this I think of this Lloydstraight into an example all right thefirst question six Australian dollars isequal to four dollars fifty US how manyUS dollars would I get for 25 Australiandollars so the way that we do thismethod is we draw up a box hence thename the box method okay and we break itup into four like this alright the firstthing we do is we 're just going to startputting in our values here so this issix Australian dollars and for thiswe 're going to get four dollars 50 uslining this up we 're after to find outwhat for twenty five Australian dollarsso I 'm keeping the Australian dollars ina line here and I want to know what I'mgoing to get in u.s. dollars okay or notthese US Dollars are this is the unknownnow it 's fairly simple what we do nowwhat we 're going to do it 's going tomultiply these diag and also here theones that are filled in so we 're goingto multiply those and divide by theother one so we 're going to multiplythese guys alright this is 25 times 450and then we divide by this one okaydivided by six and the innocence patternrepeated a fair bit so when we do thisfour dollars fifty times 25 is onehundred and twelve dollars fifty dividedby sixthis is 1875 US Dollars and that 's howthis method works it 's fairly simple andit works for a whole variety of thingslet me show you another one okay for thenext question 85 percent of what numberis 34 or you get eighty five percent fortest 34 questions correct how manyquestions on the test so when you lookat this you might think okay eighty-fivepercent here is 85 add off how muchpercent out of 100 yea this is 85 over100 and we want to knowthis here 34 out of how many okay sowith this first thing we do is we drawup our box here alright so what do wehave here we have 85 out of 100 and Iwant to know what 34 out of how manyyears okay so this is the one I 'm afterso what do we do first off what youNovember is you mentally multiply to thediagonals here so 34 times 100 which is3400 and then we divide by this one hereso once again multiply by these dividedby this so this divided by 85 how manyquestions are on the test there were 40so that 's another example of how youmight use this we 'll go through a couplemore of these okay for the next questiona car goes 160 kilometers in three hourshow far to gotherefore in 45 minutes so I will drawup this box to work this outand you might notice with this justsomething we might have to be aware ofwhich is this this particular time unitis in hours and this particular timeunit is in minutes we 're going to haveto make them into the same I 'll show youwhat I mean in a second so this 160kilometers and it is in three hours nowwe 're going to put in our 45 minuteshere but I need to convert this acrosstwo hours so this is not just a matterof saying it 's point four or five hoursbecause that let 's face it times out of60 so this is 45 minutes out of 60minutes which is 0.75 hours okay 60minutes in an hour so 0.75 hours andthen what we 're going to do is we'rejust going to treat this exactly likeevery other one we 've done we 're goingto multiply the diagonals and divide bythis one here so we 're going to get 160we 're going to times it by 0.75and then we 're going to divide so we'vemultiplied these we have divided by thisthree here so 160 times 0.75 or 3/4 of160 1/4 160 is 40 3/4 is 120 120 dividedby 3 this is 40 kilometers pretty coolrightso in here 40 kilometers all right okaylet 's have a look at this next one okayfor the last questionthe school has a girl boy ratio of 5 to4 that is to say for every 5 girlsthere 's 4 boysso first off if it 's 205 girls in schoolhow many boys are there and the secondquestion we have a look at if there's972 kids all together how many boys arethere so for both of these we 're goingto draw up our box all right so I'lldraw it up here and this will be goodbecause they 'll keep everything nice andordered so we have a five girls to fourboys ratio and then we have over here205 girls right so everything 's nice andlined up and what we do is we 're justgoing to multiply these and divide bythis so 205 times four and then we'lldivide that by five all right so what dowe get 205 times four that 's going to be820 divided by five that 's going to be164 okay so this is 164 boys okay 164all right what about part two here okayif there are 972 kids all together howmany boys are there so I 'm going to drawup my box once againand what I 'm going to do is just aslight tweak now and that 's this we'relooking at how many boys are so how manyboys under this four boys and this isout of what we 're looking at five tofour this adds up to nine or guinnessesfor every nine kids or ISIL is for everyfour boys is nine kids all right say letme know there 's 972 kids all togetherand I want to know how many boys are okso this is fairly simple because we'rejust going to now multiply 972 thisdiagonals here times 4/9 so if you dothat we 're going to get 432 it has is432 boys in this particular circumstanceanyway that 's the box method of how todo a whole bunch of things percentagesratios there 's a whole bunch of thingsyou can do with this it 's a reallyreally good little bit so anyone commenttell us what you think I hope this videowas of some help to you see you nexttime bye test
