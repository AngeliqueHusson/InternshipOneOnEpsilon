let start algebra nice simple equation like x plus equal course hard solve equation get x equal equation whole number sand solve whole pretty soon write equation ca n solve whole equation x plus whole number solution xi would need minus thats x equal minus need introduce negative good might face equation like plus equal need well keep go equation begin wondering n multiply get polynomial equation polynomial something like constant times x n plus another number times x n minus plus blab la b la equation got power right really function function f x talk could solve equation equation needs equal sign f x equal equation talk solution function f x talk root function thing solution habit alternating talking root sand solution n want confuse anybody let look equation x squared minus x could plus solution another solution minus polynomial equation though easy find solution instance simple one would x squared equal rational number equation something discovered considered adeep philosophical mystery course write x equal square root another one believe square root surely believe minus square root another solution two solution pretty nice could go way unfortunately quickly hit n solution something like x squared plus real number put real number x always positive square add even positive never get point begin nice begin graph ing equation instance f x x squared plus get value put x example would somewhere everybody probably seen parabola n root sit n value x make value f x see picture solution would place graph crossed x axis line function root equation solution graph function cross like electric fence magic special magic law magic line right one kind polynomial equation always root case f degree every polynomial case exponent highest power polynomial odd degree well one even degree turns way n root let take one odd degree took instance function f x equal x well f x course odd degree graph straight line goes origin see solution x could could say f x equal x maybe x squared times x minus look like well see way wrote f x equal x equal one x equal graph going look turns something like explain knew see root see really robust root one sort almost id move little bit wouldnt root instance put minus whole picture would move one would still root really robust picture somehow theorem behind love write word theorem especially prove write polynomial mean odd degree coefficient graze polynomial polynomial odd degree right begin something fifth plus seven x fourth plus something else odd least one real root odd exponent going key thats right going show x plug give zero answer pretty amazing say knowing little piece polynomial anyway proof really think going graph polynomial might ask graph polynomial n know anything going anyway going assume positive sake argument make make one picture would exactly corresponding picture negative want find value x zero course place graph cross x axis x axis really graph equal zero magic point axis want get ask zero take equal seven goal could exactly proof would want graph well unfortunately n even know start graph function know little know one thing positive number odd power positive negative number odd power negative number make absolute value number really really big get really really big number number positive really really really positive number negative really really negative let say b cand constant bounded something anyway take x hundred times big biggest constant x exponent sake argument x fifth power hundred times x fourth power extra time x first term enormous ly anything else fact graph function wo n even see influence term scale trying draw basically first term going dominate going important term least approximate especially x large thinking first term course x small bet cant say thing x large understand take x large let take x hundred times pretend hundred sake argument big x big x x big going say absolute x big way mathematician would write absolute x much bigger zero minus good x big x hundred x positive power much bigger exponent hundred plus one big number going draw think axis different scale x axis point put confidence n know exactly pretty close way right take x reason get enormous absolute value x fifth x plus n odd get enormous negative value first point proof say something way second point proof two graph afunction like cal led continuous function drawn without lifting pencil going start drawing n know graph really goes going draw goes somehow get point oh gosh cross x axis get well right crossed root equation goes somehow idea really root might left might right order get hereto without lifting pencil simply draw line ca n walk canada without going us right course could swim around maybe could dig tunnel might little worried really know n little tunnel place maybe real like sea let red thing well really basic point real wasnt completely understood think nineteenth century decide think took instance suppose said n know real let rational said would n worked example x cube minus real odd degree polynomial line would slip rational rational number square root cube n enough add work know hole one great mathematics due debt definition real term nice even though might already convinced real going draw rational like lot rational also lots hole seen idea whata real number really way dividing rational let say going tobe real number hey e tic said really set rational less together rational greater two set tell reason left whole would find would define number two rational number greater number hole existence way really funny term really trick saying definition avid left side body plus right side body worse saying thats space left together space right little tell real number sitting existence kind proof really construction sort thing people study maybe junior year course mathematics philosophy cut really important idea want graph function want happen buy x want find point convince point blue point go zero red side odd equation odd
