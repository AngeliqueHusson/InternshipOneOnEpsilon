let start algebra nice simple equation like x plus equal course hard solve equation get x equal equation whole number sand solve whole pretty soon write equation cant solve whole equation x plus theres whole number solution xi would need minus thats x equal minus need introduce negative thats good might face equation like plus equal need well keep go equation begin wondering didnt multiply get polynomial equation polynomial something like constant times x n plus another number times x n minus plus blab la b la equation got power right theyre really function function f x talk could solve equation equation needs equal sign f x equal equation talk solution function f x talk root function thats thing solution habit alternating talking root sand solution dont want confuse anybody let look equation x squared minus x could plus thats solution theres another solution minus polynomial equation though easy find solution instance simple one would x squared equal theres rational number equation thats something discovered considered adeep philosophical mystery course write x equal square root theres another one believe theres square root surely believe theres minus square root thats another solution two solution pretty nice could go way unfortunately quickly hit dont solution something like x squared plus real number put real number x always positive square add even positive never get point begin nice begin graph ing equation instance f x x squared plus get value put x example would id somewhere everybody probably seen parabola doesnt root sit doesnt value x make value f x see picture solution would place graph crossed x axis line function root equation solution graph function cross like electric fence magic special magic law magic line right one kind polynomial equation always root thats case f degree every polynomial case exponent highest power polynomial odd degree well one even degree turns way didnt root let take one odd degree took instance function f x equal x well f x course odd degree graph straight line goes origin see solution x could could say f x equal x maybe x squared times x minus look like well see way wrote f x equal x equal one x equal graph going look turns something like ill explain knew see root see theres really robust root one ill sort almost id move little bit wouldnt root instance put minus whole picture would move one would still root really robust picture somehow thats theres theorem behind love write word theorem especially prove theyre write polynomial mean odd degree thats coefficient graze polynomial polynomial odd degree thats right begin something fifth plus seven x fourth plus something else odd least one real root odd exponent going key thats right going show theres x plug give zero answer thats pretty amazing say knowing little piece polynomial anyway proof really think going graph polynomial might ask graph polynomial dont know anything going anyway going assume positive sake argument make make one picture would exactly corresponding picture negative want find value x zero course place graph cross x axis x axis really graph equal zero magic point axis want get ask zero take equal seven goal could exactly proof would want graph well unfortunately dont even know start graph function know little know one thing positive number odd power positive negative number odd power negative number make absolute value number really really big get really really big number number positive really really really positive number negative really really negative let say b cand constant bounded something anyway take x hundred times big biggest constant x exponent sake argument x fifth power hundred times x fourth power extra time x first term enormous ly anything else fact graph function wont even see influence term scale trying draw basically first term going dominate going important term least approximate especially x large thinking first term course x small bet cant say thing x large understand take x large let take x hundred times ill pretend hundred sake argument big x big x x big going say absolute x big way mathematician would write absolute x much bigger zero minus good x big x hundred x positive power much bigger exponent hundred plus one thats big going draw think axis different scale x axis point put confidence dont know exactly pretty close way right take x reason get enormous absolute value x fifth x plus n odd ill get enormous negative value first point proof say something way second point proof two graph afunction like cal led continuous function drawn without lifting pencil going start drawing dont know graph really goes going draw goes somehow get point oh gosh cross x axis get well right crossed thats root equation goes somehow idea really root might left might right order get hereto without lifting pencil simply draw line cant walk canada without going us right course could swim around maybe could dig tunnel might little worried really know wasnt little tunnel place maybe real like sea let red thing well thats really basic point real wasnt completely understood think nineteenth century decide think took instance suppose said dont know real rational said wouldnt worked example x cube minus real odd degree polynomial thats line would slip rational theres rational number square root cube enough youd add work know hole one great mathematics thats due debt definition real term nice even though might already convinced theres real going draw rational like lot rational theyre also lots hole weve seen idea whata real number really way dividing rational let say going tobe real number hey e tic said really set rational less together rational greater two set tell reason left whole would find would define number two rational number greater number hole existence way really funny term really trick saying definition avid left side body plus right side body worse saying thats space left together space right little tell real number thats sitting existence kind proof really construction sort thing people study maybe junior year course mathematics philosophy cut really important idea want graph function want happen buy x want find point
