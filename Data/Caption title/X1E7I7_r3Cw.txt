Ok , so I 've been learning about Pythagorasand the dirt on him is just too good.You 've probably heard of the Pythagorean Theorembut not the part where Pythagoraswas a crazy cult leader who thought he 'd madea deal with a god thousands of years agoand could remember all of his past lives.Oh , and he killed a guy.I mean maybe it was a long time ago and he was afraid of beans.As in beans , they just like freaked him outor something , I do n't know.But mostly I want to talk about the murdery part.See , Pythagoras and his cult of Pythagoreanshad this cool-kids club where they'dtalk about proportions all day.They 'd be like , `` Hey , I drew a two by threerectangle using a straight-edge and compass.Is n't that awesome ? `` And then someone would be like , '' Hey guys , I have a box that 's two by three and a half ? `` And the cool kids would be like , '' Three and a half ? That 's not a number ! Get out of our club ! `` And then they 'd make the units half the lengthand call it four by seven , and everything was okay.Even if your box is 2.718 by 6.28you can just divide your units into thousandthsand you 'd get a box that 's a nice , even2,718 by 6,280 . It 's not a simple proportionbut hey , the box still has a whole number proportion , so Pythagoras is happy.Unless it 's a box of beans , then he freaks out.I 'd like to imagine what it would be like tothink of numbers the way they did.Maybe you think of numbers as being on a line.Numbers one way , zero , and negative numbers the other , and there are numbers between them : fractions , rationals , filling in the gaps.But Pythagoras did n't think about numberslike this at all.They were n't points in a continuumthey were each their own , separate being , which was still pretty modern becausebefore that people only thought of numbers as adjectives , numbers of . In Pythagoras 's world , there isno number between seven and eight , and there is no number three over two so much asa relationship between three and two , a proportion.Six to four has the same relationshipbecause the numbers share this evenness , which when accounted for makes it three to two.The universe to Pythagoras was made upof these relationships . Mathematics was n't numbers , mathematics was between the numbers.Though while people admire how much Pythagorasloved proportions , there 's a darkflip side to that obsession.How far was he willing to go to protectthe proportions he loved ? Would he kill for them ? Would he die for them ? And the answer was he 'd go pretty faruntil beans got involved.It 's time for Time Line Time.Mathematicians like lines.I want the context , because in school todayif you bring out the ruler and compassand are like , `` Let 's do some geometry ! Let 's draw two lines at 90 degree anglesusing a straight-edge and compass ! Here 's a happy square ! `` Then you 've probably had years of math classalready and think of geometry as being harderthan adding big numbers together.You probably think that zero is a simple , easy conceptand have heard of decimals too.Well , here 's now , 2012.Here 's Einstein , Euler , Newton and Da Vinci -- that sure was a while ago ! Now let 's go all the way back to whenArabic numerals were invented andbrought to the West by Fibbonacci.Before that , arithmetic was nightmarishly hard , so if you can multiply multi-digit numbers togetheryou can go back in time and impressthe beans out of Pythagoras.And before that there was no concept ofzero , except in India where zerowas discovered around here.And if you keep going back you get to the year one , ( there 's no year zero , of course , because zero had n't been invented ) and back a bit more you get to folk likeAristotle , Euclid , Archimedesand then finally Pythagoras , all the way back in 6th century BCE.Point is , you can do some pretty cool mathematicswithout having a good handle on arithmeticand people did for a long time.And in school when they tell youyou need to memorize your multiplicationtable and graph a parabolabefore you can learn real mathematics , they are lying to you.In Pythagoras 's time there were no variables , no equations or formulas like we see today , Pythagoras 's theorem was n't ' a squared plus b squared equals c squared , 'it was 'The squares of the legs of a right trianglehave the same area as the square of the hypotenuse , 'all written out.And when he said 'square ' he meant 'square . 'One leg 's square plus the other leg 's squareequals hypotenuse 's square.Three literally squared plus four made into a square.Those two squares have the same area asa five by five square.You can cut out the nine squares hereand the sixteen here and fit them togetherwhere these 25 squares are , and in the same way , you can cut out the 25 hypotenuse squaresand fit them into the two leg squares.Pythagoras thought you could do this trickwith any right triangle , that it was just a matter of figuring outhow many pieces to cut each side into.There was a relationship between the lengthof one side and the length of anotherand he wanted to find it on this map.But the trouble began with the simplest right triangleone where both the legs are the same length , one where both the legs ' squares are equal.If the legs are both one then thehypotenuse is something that , when squared , gives two . So what 's the square root of two andhow do we make it into a whole number ratio ? Square root two is very close to 1.4which would be a whole number ratio of 10:14but 10 squared plus 10 squared is definitelynot 14 squared , and a ratio of 1,000 to1,414 is even closer , and a ratio of100,000,000 to 141,421,356 is very close indeedbut still not exact , so what is it ? Pythagoras wanted to find the perfect ratiohe knew it must exist , but meanwhilesomeone from his very own Pythagorean brotherhoodproved there was n't a ratio , the square rootof two is irrational , that in decimal notation ( once decimal notation was invented ) the digits go on forever . Usually this proofis given algebraically , something likethis , which is pretty simpleand beautiful if you know algebra , but the Pythagoreans didn't.So I like to imagine how they thoughtof this proof , no algebra required.Okay , so Pythagoras is all like , '' There 's totally a ratio , you canmake this with whole numbers . `` And this guy 's like , '' Is not ! '' `` Is too ! `` `` Is not ! '' `` Is too ! '' `` Fine have it your way.So , there 's a whole number ratio in simplestform , where this square plus this square equalsthis square . '' `` Yeah , that 's the Pythagoreantheorem , I made it . '' `` Yeah , though for this triangleyou do n't even need the full theorem.it 's easy to see that it 's the same areaby cutting each part into four triangles . `` `` But I do n't want to divide the squares upinto triangles , I want unit squares . `` `` So kind of like this , where this square isdivided into units and so is this one andthey all fit perfectly into this one and vice versa , but not like this . It almost works , but youstart dividing this square evenly to fill upthe two equal other squares , and you 've gotthis one odd one out . There 's an odd numberof squares to begin with , so you can'tdivide them evenly between the two squares . `` `` That 's not even a right triangle , what 's your point ? `` `` Just that you know an odd number like sevenis n't gon na be it without even trying.An odd number times itself gives an odd numberof squares , so whatever this number is , it ca n't be seven , it has to be even . `` `` Ok , so the hypotenuse is even , that 's fine . `` `` So what if I proved the leg is even too ? `` `` Then it 's not in simplest form . `` `` Any ratio where both are even you divide by two untilyou ca n't divide anymore , because one of them is oddand then that ratio is the best . I thoughtwe assumed we were talking about the simplest form ratio . `` `` We are . If there 's a ratio in simlest form at leastone of the numbers is odd and since the hypotenuse has toliterally be divisible by two , then the leg must be the odd one.So what if I proved the leg had to be even ? `` `` You just proved it 's not . It ca n't be both . `` `` Unless it does n't exist ! What you forget Pythagoras is that if this is a squarethen the two sides are the same . Just as this is divsibleright down the center so too is it divisible the other way ! And the number squares on this side , which arethe number of squares in just one leg is an even number.And for a number of squares to be even whatdoes the number have to be , Pythagoras , oh my brother ? `` `` If leg squared is even then the leg is even.But it ca n't be even , because it 's already odd . `` `` Unless it does n't exist . `` `` But if they 're both even you can divide bothby two and start again , but this still has to be evenwhich means this still has to be even , which meansyou can divide by two again , but then it has to be evenso everything is even forever and you never findthe perfect ratio . Aww , beans '' He had a vision , a beautiful vision of a worldmade up of relationships between numbers.If this was n't a whole number ratio , then what was it ? The Pythagoreans still believed , wanted to believethat irrationality was somehow false and the worldwas as they wanted it . So this proof stayed secret.Until someone spilled the beans.According to some , it was all a guy named Hippasusand Pythagoras threw him of a boat to drown himas punishment for ruining what had been perfect.Or maybe it was someone else who discovered itor Hippasus or someone else who was killedby the Pythagoreans long after Pythagoras wasdead or maybe they just got exiled , who knows ? And how did Pythagoras die ? Well , according to one guy some guys got madbecause they did n't get into the cool kids ' club.So they set Pythagoras ' house on fire.And Pythagoras was running away and theywere chasing him , but then they came upon a fieldand not just any field , but a field of beans.And Pythagoras turned around to face his pursuersand proclaimed : `` Better to be slaugheteredby enemies than to trample on beans ! `` And he was . Others say he ran off and starvedhimself to death . Or just got caught by his enemiesbecause he ran around the bean field instead of through itor who knows what happened . People claim Pythagorasdid n't like beans because he thought they werebad for digestion , or gave you bad dreamsor reminded him of male genitalia orbecause he did n't want a clubhouse full offlatulating mathematicians or he just didn'tlike them metaphorically.He and his followers were or were n't vegetariandid or did n't sacrifice animalspossibly were only allowed to eat certain colors of birdsI mean he definitely had a lot of rules to followbut just what they were and what they meantis lost to history.I 'd like to give you a colorful story about exactlywhat happened with Pythagoras , but somehowthat kind of truth does n't last.What I do know is that the square root of two isirrational , that there 's no way to havethe length of a side of a square and of thesquare 's diagonal both be whole numbers.Mathematical truth is truth that indures.This proof is just as good now as it was2500 years ago , I mean it 's awesome andit shows that there 's more to theworld than whole numbers andshame on the Pythagoreans who did n't havethe beans to admit it . test
