In the last videos I talked about the derivatives of simple functions , things like powers ofx , sin ( x ) , and exponentials , the goal being to have a clear picture or intuition to holdin your mind that explains where these formulas come from.Most functions you use to model the world involve mixing , combining and tweaking thesethese simple functions in some way ; so our goal now is to understand how to take derivativesof more complicated combinations ; where again , I want you to have a clear picture in mindfor each rule.This really boils down into three basic ways to combine functions together : Adding them , multiplying them , and putting one inside the other ; also known as composing them.Sure , you could say subtracting them , but that¡¯s really just multiplying the secondby -1 , then adding.Likewise , dividing functions is really just the same as plugging one into the function1/x , then multiplying.Most functions you come across just involve layering on these three types of combinations , with no bound on how monstrous things can become.But as long as you know how derivatives play with those three types of combinations , youcan always just take it step by step and peal through the layers.So , the question is , if you know the derivatives of two functions , what is the derivative oftheir sum , of their product , and of the function compositions between them ? The sum rule is the easiest , if somewhat tounge-twisting to say out loud : The derivative of a sum oftwo functions is the sum of their derivatives.But it¡¯s worth warming up with this example by really thinking through what it means totake a derivative of a sum of two functions , since the derivative patterns for productsand function composition won¡¯t be so straight forward , and will require this kind of deeperthinking.The function f ( x ) = sin ( x ) + x2 is a function where , for every input , you add together thevalues of sin ( x ) and x2 at that point.For example , at x = 0.5 , the height of the sine graph is given by this bar , the heightof the x2 parabola is given by this bar , and their sum is the length you get by stackingthem together.For the derivative , you ask what happens as you nudge the input slightly , maybe increasingit to 0.5+dx.The difference in the value of f between these two values is what we call df.Well , pictured like this , I think you¡¯ll agree that the total change in height is whateverthe change to the sine graph is , what we might call d ( sin ( x ) ) , plus whatever the change tox2 is , d ( x2 ) .We know the derivative of sine is cosine , and what that means is that this little changed ( sin ( x ) ) would be about cos ( x ) dx.It¡¯s proportional to the size of dx , with a proportionality constant equal to cosineof whatever input we started at.Similarly , because the derivative of x2 is 2x , the change in the height of the x2 graphis about 2x*dx.So , df/dx , the ratio of the tiny change to the sum function to the tiny change in x thatcaused it , is indeed cos ( x ) +2x , the sum of the derivatives of its parts.But like I said , things are a bit different for products.Let¡¯s think through why , in terms of tiny nudges.In this case , I don¡¯t think graphs are our best bet for visualizing things.Pretty commonly in math , all levels of math really , if you¡¯re dealing with a productof two things , it helps to try to understand it as some form of area.In this case , you might try to configure some mental setup of a box whose side-lengths aresin ( x ) and x2.What would that mean ? Well , since these are functions , you might think of these sides as adjustable ; dependenton the value of x , which you might think of as a number that you can freely adjust.So , just getting the feel for this , focus on that top side , whose changes as the functionsin ( x ) .As you change the value of x up from 0 , it increases in up to a length of 1 as sin ( x ) moves towards its peak.After that , it starts decreasing as sin ( x ) comes down from 1.And likewise , that height changes as x2.So f ( x ) , defined as this product , is the area of this box.For the derivative , think about how a tiny change to x by dx influences this area ; thatresulting change in area is df.That nudge to x causes the width to change by some small d ( sin ( x ) ) , and the height tochange by some d ( x2 ) .This gives us three little snippets of new area : A thin rectangle on the bottom , whosearea is its width , sin ( x ) , times its thin height , d ( x2 ) ; there¡¯s a thin rectangleon the right , whose area is its height , x2 , times its thin width , d ( sin ( x ) ) .And there¡¯s also bit in the corner.But we can ignore it , since its area will ultimately be proportional to dx2 , which becomesnegligible as dx goes to 0.This is very similar to what I showed last video , with the x2 diagram.Just like then , keep in mind that I¡¯m using somewhat beefy changes to draw things , sowe can see them , but in principle think of dx as very very small , meaning d ( x2 ) and d ( sin ( x ) ) are also very very small.Applying what we know about the derivative of sine and x2 , that tiny change d ( x2 ) is2x*dx , and that tiny change d ( sin ( x ) ) is cos ( x ) dx.Dividing out by that dx , the derivative df/dx is sin ( x ) by the derivative of x2 , plus x2by the derivative of sine.This line of reasoning works for any two functions.A common mnemonic for the product rule is to say in your head ¡°left d right , rightd left¡±.In this example , sin ( x ) *x2 , ¡°left d right¡± means you take the left function , in thiscase sin ( x ) , times the derivative of the right , x2 , which gives 2x.Then you add ¡°right d left¡± : the right function , x2 , times the derivative of theleft , cos ( x ) .Out of context , this feels like kind of a strange rule , but when you think of this adjustablebox you can actually see how those terms represent slivers of area.¡°Left d right¡± is the area of this bottom rectangle , and ¡°right d left¡± is the areaof this rectangle on the right.By the way , I should mention that if you multiply by a constant , say 2*sin ( x ) , things end upmuch simpler.The derivative is just that same constant times the derivative of the function , in thiscase 2*cos ( x ) .I¡¯ll leave it to you to pause and ponder to verify that this makes sense.Aside from addition and multiplication , the other common way to combine functions thatcomes up all the time is function composition.For example , let¡¯s say we take the function x2 , and shove it on inside sin ( x ) to get anew function , sin ( x2 ) .What¡¯s the derivative of this new function ? Here I¡¯ll choose yet another way to visualize things , just to emphasize that in creativemath , we have lots of options.I¡¯ll put up three number lines.The top one will hold the value of x , the second one will represent the value of x2 , and that third line will hold the value of sin ( x2 ) .That is , the function x2 gets you from line 1 to line 2 , and the function sine gets youfrom line 2 to line 3.As I shift that value of x , maybe up to the value 3 , then value on the second shifts towhatever x2 is , in this case 9.And that bottom value , being the sin ( x2 ) , will go over to whatever the sin ( 9 ) is.So for the derivative , let¡¯s again think of nudging that x-value by some little dx , and I always think it¡¯s helpful to think of x starting as some actual number , maybe1.5.The resulting nudge to this second value , the change to x2 caused by such a dx , is whatwe might call d ( x2 ) .You can expand this as 2x*dx , which for our specific input that length would be 2* ( 1.5 ) *dx , but it helps to keep it written as d ( x2 ) for now.In fact let me go one step further and give a new name to x2 , maybe h , so this nudge d ( x2 ) is just dh.Now think of that third value , which is pegged at sin ( h ) .It¡¯s change d ( sin ( h ) ) ; the tiny change caused by the nudge dh.By the way , the fact that it¡¯s moving left while the dh bump is to the right just meansthat this change d ( sin ( h ) ) is some negative number.Because we know the derivative of sine , we can expand d ( sin ( h ) ) as cos ( h ) *dh ; that¡¯swhat it means for the derivative of sine to be cosine.Unfolding things , replacing h with x2 again , that bottom nudge is cos ( x2 ) d ( x2 ) .And we could unfold further , noting that d ( x2 ) is 2x*dx.And it¡¯s always good to remind yourself of what this all actually means.In this case where we started at x = 1.5 up top , this means that the size of that nudgeon the third line is about cos ( 1.52 ) *2 ( 1.5 ) * ( the size of dx ) ; proportional to the size of dx , where the derivative here gives us that proportionality constant.Notice what we have here , we have the derivative of the outside function , still taking in theunaltered inside function , and we multiply it by the derivative of the inside function.Again , there¡¯s nothing special about sin ( x ) and x2.If you have two functions g ( x ) and h ( x ) , the derivative of their composition function g ( h ( x ) ) is the derivative of g , evaluated at h ( x ) , times the derivative of h.This is what we call the ¡°chain rule¡±.Notice , for the derivative of g , I¡¯m writing it as dg/dh instead of dg/dx.On the symbolic level , this serves as a reminder that you still plug in the inner functionto this derivative.But it¡¯s also an important reflection of what this derivative of the outer functionactually represents.Remember , in our three-lines setup , when we took the derivative of sine on the bottom , we expanded the size of the nudge d ( sin ) as cos ( h ) *dh.This was because we didn¡¯t immediately know how the size of that bottom nudge dependedon x , that¡¯s kind of the whole thing we¡¯re trying to figure out , but we could take thederivative with respect to the intermediate variable h.That is , figure out how to express the size of that nudge as multiple of dh.Then it unfolded by figuring out what dh was.So in this chain rule expression , we¡¯re saying look at the ratio between a tiny changein g , the final output , and a tiny change in h that caused it , h being the value thatwe¡¯re plugging into g.Then multiply that by the tiny change in h divided by the tiny change in x that causedit.The dh¡¯s cancel to give the ratio between a tiny change in the final output , and thetiny change to the input that , through a certain chain of events , brought it about.That cancellation of dh is more than just a notational trick , it¡¯s a genuine reflectionof the tiny nudges that underpin calculus.So those are the three basic tools in your belt to handle derivatives of functions thatcombine many smaller things : The sum rule , the product rule and the chain rule.I should say , there¡¯s a big difference between knowing what the chain rule and product rulesare , and being fluent with applying them in even the most hairy of situations.I said this at the start of the series , but it¡¯s worth repeating : Watching videos , anyvideos , about these mechanics of calculus will never substitute for practicing themyourself , and building the muscles to do these computations yourself.I wish I could offer to do that for you , but I¡¯m afraid the ball is in your court , myfriend , to seek out practice.What I can offer , and what I hope I have offered , is to show you where these rules come from , to show that they¡¯re not just something to be memorized and hammered away ; but insteadare natural patterns that you too could have discovered by just patiently thinking throughwhat a derivative means.Thank you to everyone who supported this series , and once more I¡¯d like to say a specialthanks to Brilliant.org.For those of you who want to go flex those problem solving muscles , Brilliant offersa platform aimed at training you to think like a mathematician.I don¡¯t know about you , but I¡¯ve always found it all too easy to fall into the habitof just reading math or watching lectures without taking the time to do some real problem-solvingin between , even though that¡¯s always the part where I learn the most.Brilliant is a great place to get that practice , and if you visit brilliant.org/3b1b , or moresimply follow the link on the screen and in the description , it lets them know you camefrom this channel.Their calculus material is a nice complement to this series , but some of my other favoritesare their probability and complex algebra sequences . test
