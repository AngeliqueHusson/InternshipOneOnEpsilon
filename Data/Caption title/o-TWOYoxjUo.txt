Identify complementary and supplementaryangles in the image below . So just as a remindercomplementary angles are two angles that add up to 90 degrees andsupplementary angles , supplementary angles add up to180 degrees . So let 's look at this diagram . First let 's look for the complementary , complementary angles . So angles that add up to 90 degrees and so they drew this right angle right over here.So we know that angle FAHis a right angle , because they did this little half box right over there , and it 's made up of two adjacent anglesand these two adjacent angles make up a 90 degree angle so they must add up to 90 degrees.so the two angles -- angle FACAngle FACand AngleCAH andAngle CAH , let me do it in a different color since I already used that ) and angle CAH andAngle CAH arecomplementary because the measures of these two anglesmust add up to 180 degrees are -- sorry , must add up to this 90 degrees right over here.And I think that 's all the complementary angles.Just these two , they add up to this right angle , to this 90 degrees.Now let 's think about the supplementary angles , sosupplementary , supplementary angles . They add up to 180 degrees.So you have angle FAC , or we could call it CAF . It 's the same angle . So angle CAF , and then this angle out here , FAB.When they 're adjacent to each other and they clearly form a straight anglewhich is 180 degrees when you add their two measures.So these two are clearlysupplementary andangle FAB . FAB.CAF and FAB together definitely add up to 180 degreesso they 're supplementary . And then the other one -- we can do angle CAH , angle CAH , which is this right over here , that plus HAB clearly add up.They form -- They 're adjacent.They form a straight angle.So they are clearly adding up to 180 degrees . So they are also supplementary.CAH andangle HAB.And we 're done . These two angles add up to 90.These two add up to 180 , these two add up to 180 . test
