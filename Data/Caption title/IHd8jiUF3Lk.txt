- WELCOME TO A LESSON ON CONVERSE , CONTRAPOSITIVE , AND INVERSE OF AN IF-THEN STATEMENT.IT CAN BE HELPFUL TO MODEL A CONDITIONAL STATEMENTBY USING A VENN DIAGRAM.WE CAN DRAW A CIRCLE TO REPRESENT THE STATEMENT P , AS WE SEE HERE.SO IF WE 'RE INSIDE P , P IS TRUE.AND IF WE 'RE OUTSIDE P , P WOULD BE FALSE , OR WE COULD SAY `` NOT P. '' SO FOR THE CONDITIONAL IF P THEN Q , THE VENN DIAGRAM WOULD HAVE SET P INSIDE SET Q , GUARANTEEING THAT IF P IS TRUE , Q WOULD ALSO BE TRUE.FOR THE CONVERSE , IF WE SWITCH THE ORDER OF THE HYPOTHESIS AND CONCLUSION , WE WOULD HAVE IF Q THEN P.NOTICE HOW WE ALSO SWITCHED THE SETS P AND Q , SO IF Q IS TRUE IT 'S GUARANTEED THAT P WOULD ALSO BE TRUE.AND FOR THE BICONDITIONAL , P IF AND ONLY IF Q.REMEMBER , THAT MEANS IF P THEN Q IS TRUE , AND IF Q THEN P IS TRUE , P AND Q WOULD ACTUALLY BE THE SAME SET.SO IF WE 'RE IN P WE 'RE ALSO IN Q.NOW LET 'S TALK ABOUT THE CONVERSE , INVERSE , AND CONTRAPOSITIVE OF A GIVEN CONDITIONAL STATEMENT.IF WE WANT TO MODEL THE CONDITIONAL STATEMENT , '' IF I WAKE UP EARLY THEN I WILL LIFT WEIGHTS , '' ASSUMING THIS IS IN THE FORM OF IF P THEN Q , WE 'D HAVE TO HAVE THE SET P INSIDE SET Q.SO IF WE 'RE INSIDE P , MEANING WE WAKE UP EARLY , THEN WE 'LL ALSO BE INSIDE SET Q , MEANING WE 'LL LIFT WEIGHTS.SO FOR THE CONVERSE IF Q THEN P , WE INTERCHANGE THE HYPOTHESIS AND CONCLUSION.SO WE 'D HAVE , `` IF I LIFT WEIGHTS THEN I WAKE UP EARLY . `` LOOKING AT THE VENN DIAGRAM , '' IF I LIFT WEIGHTS '' MEANS I 'M INSIDE SET Q , '' THEN I WAKE UP EARLY '' MEANS I 'M INSIDE SET P.SO JUST BECAUSE I 'M INSIDE Q DOES N'T GUARANTEETHAT I 'M INSIDE P , THEREFORE THIS IS NOT LOGICALLY EQUIVALENT TO IF P THEN Q , WHICH MEANS IT MAY BE TRUE OR IT MAY BE FALSE.THE CONTRAPOSITIVE WOULD BE IF NOT Q THEN NOT P.SO WE INTERCHANGE THE HYPOTHESIS AND CONCLUSIONAND ALSO NEGATE THEM.SO THE STATEMENT WOULD BE , '' IF I DO N'T LIFT WEIGHTS THEN I DO N'T WAKE UP EARLY . `` AGAIN , LOOKING AT THE VENN DIAGRAM , '' IF I DO N'T LIFT WEIGHTS '' -- AND THIS MEANS I 'M NOT INSIDE Q OR THAT I AM OUTSIDE Q -- SO IF I 'M OUTSIDE Q THEN `` I DO N'T WAKE UP EARLY , '' WHICH MEANS I 'M OUTSIDE P.SO IF I 'M OUTSIDE Q I 'M GUARANTEED TO BE OUTSIDE P , THEREFORE THIS STATEMENT IS LOGICALLY EQUIVALENTTO IF P THEN Q.AND THEN FOR THE INVERSE WE WOULD HAVE IF NOT P THEN NOT Q.SO WE NEGATE THE HYPOTHESIS AND CONCLUSION , SO WE 'D HAVE `` IF I DO N'T WAKE UP EARLY I WILL NOT LIFT WEIGHTS . `` SO `` IF I DO N'T WAKE UP EARLY '' MEANS I 'M OUTSIDE P.SO IF I 'M OUTSIDE P THEN '' I WILL NOT LIFT WEIGHTS '' OR I 'M OUTSIDE Q.SO IF I 'M OUTSIDE P I 'M NOT GUARANTEED TO BE OUTSIDE Q , AND THEREFORE THIS IS NOT LOGICALLY EQUIVALENT TOIF P THEN Q , WHICH MEANS IT MAY BE TRUE OR FALSE.NOW LET 'S TAKE A LOOK AT A SECOND EXAMPLE.HERE WE WANT TO USE THE GIVEN STATEMENTTO DETERMINE THE CONVERSE , CONTRAPOSITIVE , AND INVERSE , AND THEN DETERMINE IF THE NEW STATEMENT IS EQUIVALENT , AND WE 'LL ALSO DETERMINE IF IT WOULD BE TRUE OR FALSE.THE GIVEN STATEMENT IS , '' IF I 'M HIKING IN THE GRAND CANYON THEN I 'M IN ARIZONA . `` THE GRAND CANYON IS ONE OF THE LARGEST TOURIST ATTRACTIONSLOCATED IN ARIZONA , AND IT 'S ALSO A NATIONAL LANDMARK.SO IF I 'M HIKING THE GRAND CANYON COULD BE MODELEDBY THIS CIRCLE P , AND IF I 'M IN ARIZONA WOULD BE MODELED BY CIRCLE Q.NOTICE HOW IT 'S POSSIBLE TO BE IN ARIZONABUT NOT BE HIKING THE GRAND CANYON , MEANING OUTSIDE P BUT INSIDE Q.SO THE CONVERSE IF Q THEN P WOULD BE , '' IF I 'M IN ARIZONA THEN I 'M HIKING THE GRAND CANYON . `` SO IF I 'M INSIDE SET Q I 'M NOT GUARANTEED TO BE INSIDE P , AND THEREFORE THE CONVERSE IS NOT EQUIVALENT TO IF P THEN Q.SO IN THIS SPECIFIC CASE , JUST BECAUSE I 'M IN ARIZONADOES NOT MEAN THAT I 'M HIKING THE GRAND CANYON , THEREFORE THIS WOULD BE FALSE.THE CONTRAPOSITIVE IS IF NOT Q THEN NOT P , AND THIS WOULD BE , '' IF I 'M NOT IN ARIZONATHEN I 'M NOT HIKING THE GRAND CANYON . `` `` IF I 'M NOT IN ARIZONA '' WOULD MEAN THAT I 'M OUTSIDE Q , AND IF I 'M OUTSIDE Q I 'M GUARANTEED TO BE OUTSIDE P , THEREFORE THE CONTRAPOSITIVE IS LOGICALLY EQUIVALENT TOIF P THEN Q , THEREFORE THIS IS GUARANTEED TO BE TRUE.THE INVERSE WOULD BE IF NOT P THEN NOT Q.SO `` IF I 'M NOT HIKING THE GRAND CANYONTHEN I 'M NOT IN ARIZONA . `` IF I 'M NOT HIKING THE GRAND CANYON , THAT WOULD MEAN I 'M OUTSIDE P.SO IF I 'M OUTSIDE PTHEN `` I 'M NOT IN ARIZONA '' WOULD BE OUTSIDE Q.WELL , JUST BECAUSE I 'M OUTSIDE P DOES N'T MEAN I 'M OUTSIDE Q.SO THIS IS NOT LOGICALLY EQUIVALENT TO IF P THEN Q.FOR THIS SPECIFIC CASE , '' IF I 'M NOT HIKING THE GRAND CANYON THEN I 'M NOT IN ARIZONA '' WOULD BE FALSEBECAUSE THERE ARE A LOT OF OTHER PLACES TO BE IN ARIZONAOTHER THAN THE GRAND CANYON.FOR EXAMPLE , IF I 'M IN PHOENIX I 'M NOT HIKING THE GRAND CANYONBUT I AM IN ARIZONA.AND JUST IN CASE YOU HAVE N'T SEEN THE GRAND CANYON BEFORE , HERE 'S A NICE PICTURE OF IT.AND TO HIKE TO THE BOTTOM AND BACK UPTAKES MOST PEOPLE THE ENTIRE DAY.I HOPE YOU FOUND THIS VIDEO HELPFUL.THANK YOU FOR WATCHING . test
