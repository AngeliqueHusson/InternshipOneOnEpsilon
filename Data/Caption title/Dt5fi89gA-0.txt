so in this video we 're going to find thearea of a triangle in the formula thatwe use to find the area of a triangle isa equals 1/2 times the base times theheight the a stands for the area the Bstands for the base and the H stands forthe height and before we get startedwith an example I want to talk about howwe find our base and our height what Ilike to do is I always like to pick thebottom side of the triangle to be mybase and if you do that the height isalways going to be the distance betweenthe top of the triangle and the base butnotice how the height has to be verticalor the line has to go up and down thisis an easy example because the righttriangle has a left leg that goesstraight up and down so the height isjust a distance of this leg but let'stake a look at example where it 's not soobvious let 's go down to this bottomleft example notice how I pick thebottom side of the triangle to be mybase and then to find the height we haveto go to the top of the triangle and wehave to draw a line that goes straightup and down right to the base in thatdistance straight down from the top ofthe triangle to the base is going to beyour height and the same thing for thistriangle on the bottom right notice howthe base is the bottom side of thistriangle and in order to find the heightwe have to go to the top of the triangleand we have to draw a line goingstraight up and down and that distanceto the base is going to be our height sonow I think we 're ready to get startedwith an example so here we have a righttriangle with one side with the lengthof 10 meters and another side with alength of 4 meters the first thing I'mgoing to do is find the length of thebase of my triangle I always pick thebase to be the bottom side of thetriangle and since the bottom side has alength of 10 meters I know that my baseis going to equal 10 meters and now I'mgoing to find the height of the trianglethe height of the triangle is always thevertical distance between the top of thetriangle and the base and since this isright triangle the vertical distancebetween the top and the base is exactlythe same as the left leg of the triangleso the left side of this triangle of 4meters is going to be equal to ourheight so now that we found our base inour height we can plug everything intoour formula the area is going to beequal to 1/2 times the base and we knowthat the base is 10 meters so I 'm goingto plug in 10 meters for our base andthis is multiplied by the height and weknow that our height is equal to 4meters so I 'm going to plug in 4 metersfor the height so now we just need tomultiply everything together our area isgoing to be equal to 1/2 times 10 whichis 5 and 5 times 4 which is equal to 20and we ca n't forget about our units areais always expressed in square units suchas feet squared or yards squared butsince we were given meters in thisparticular problem our units are goingto be meters squared so the area of thistriangle is equal to 20 square meters test
