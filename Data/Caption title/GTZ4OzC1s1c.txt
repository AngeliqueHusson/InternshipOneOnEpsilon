hi welcome section probability statistics tutor section going build last section dealing probability distribution introduce going section talk first real probability distribution cal led binomial distribution binomial distribution read first time really make feel confused make feel like really thing need know really big learned last section probability distribution function really fancy big word really mean know function algebra one number get number outwell probability distribution speak instead getting old number given value random variable x probability variable actually occur ring value thats whats happening binomial distribution specific type distribution oka yin last section talking general term probability distribution write chart form histogram form know bar graph something kind show learned section gon na study specific useful common probability distribution cal led binomial distribution find learn way problem know binomial distribution whats going happen every time write going write actual function f x equal write function like know function form algebra one yeah trigonometry something know f x equal x squared one time loo ked really foreign beginning binomial distribution look little foreign tackle problem see applied big deal actually big function gon na gon na write binomial distribution learn calculate function various value x also going talk little bit end tables back book almost every book statistics teach kind use well book writing binomial distribution telling love try teach want start example feel thats thats best thing forget learning something complicated cal led binomial distribution work example want think let say test test theres question question question idea test didnt study test question choice b c e right actually something might actually enjoy learning anyway giggle whats probability getting right wrong whats probability well poorly test question let ask completely guess given question forgive fact theres four question question number one completely guess theres five choice probability gon na get question right five right learning probability know theres one way get right answer theres probability getting aright answer right probability guessing one question first one probability getting right answer gon na call probability po kay p thats gon na say equal said since theres gon na go convert decimal think convince put calculator find probability would probability wrong answer guessing wrong answer probability wrong answer question number got right answer many choice many wrong choice sare theres wrong choice every single question right probability getting wrong answer pretty theres four ways get wrong answer instead p used thing q already said probability q getting wrong answer also know q equal one minus p know equal said equal word probability right answer probability wrong answer minus probability right answer weve minus business ever since beginning probability look foreign go back review probability right probability awrong would guess minus right far rocket science one question first one test right wrong question going ask actually form binomial distribution thing going learn form going like total probability particular problem guessing three four right answer correctly four two three four know probability getting wrong individual question theres want calculate whats total probability lesson binomial distribution probability tutor lesson binomial distribution probability tutor lesson binomial distribution probability tutor lesson binomial distribution probability tutor lesson binomial distribution probability tutor lesson binomial distribution probability tutor lesson binomial distribution probability tutor lesson binomial distribution probability tutor lesson binomial distribution probability tutor lesson binomial distribution probability tutor
