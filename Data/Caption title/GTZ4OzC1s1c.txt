hi and welcome to this section of theprobability and statistics tutor and inthis section we 're going to build onwhat we did in the last section dealingwith probability distribution functionswhen we introduced that and we 're goingto in this section talk about our firstreal probability distribution called thebinomial distribution okay so thebinomial distribution when you read itfor the first time it really sometimescan can can make you feel confused andmake you feel like it 's a really toughthing but the thing that you need toknow is that it 's really not a big dealokay what we learned in the last sectionis that a probability distributionfunction is just a really fancy big wordand all it really means is that you knowyou have functions from algebra one youput a number in you get a number outwell these probability distributions arefunctions so to speak that instead ofjust getting any old number out at anygiven value of your random variable Xyou have a probability of that of thatvariable actually occurring with thatvalue that 's what 's happening here sothis is a binomial distribution it 's aspecific type of distribution okayin the last section we were talking ingeneral terms here 's a probabilitydistribution and I just write it down ina chart form or in a histogram form youknow in a bar graph or something to kindof show you what it is we learned aboutit in this section we 're gon na study avery specific very useful very commonprobability distribution called thebinomial distribution so what we'regonna find for each of these problemsreally is that once you learn the waythe problem is constructed and know thatit 's a binomial distribution what'sgoing to happen every time is you'regoing to write down with your pencilyou 're going to write down an actualfunction f of X is equal to and you'regonna write down what this function isjust like a you know a function formalgebra one yeah or or trigonometry orsomething you know f of X is equal to xsquared at one time that looked reallyforeign to you so here in the beginningwith the binomial distribution it'sgonna look a little foreign to you butonce we tackle some problems and see howit 's applied it 's not a big deal it'sactually not a big function at all sowhat we 're gon na do is we 're gon na writedown this binomial distribution we'regonna learn how to calculate the valuesof the function at various values of Xand we 're also going to talk a littlebit at the end about using the tables inthe back of your book that that almostevery book on statistics will have andteach you kind of how to useas well so most books will just startout by writing down what the binomialdistribution is and telling you to learnit and love it and try to teach you howto do it I want to start out with anexample because I feel that that 's thatthat 's the best thing to do so forgetthat we 're learning about somethingcomplicated called a binomialdistribution and just work with me onthis example okay here 's what I want youto think about let 's say we have fourquestions on a test it 's amultiple-choice test so there 's question1 question 2 question 3 question 4 Ihave no idea what this test is aboutokay because I did n't study so I 'm gonnaguess at this test each question hasfive choices a B C D and E right so it'sactually something you might actuallyenjoy learning about anyway just forjust for giggles because what I 'm gonnaend up asking you is what 's theprobability of getting some of thesequestions right and wrong okay andwhat 's the probability of doing well anddoing poorly on the test okay so fourquestions and each question has fivechoices okay so let me ask you this ifyou completely guess at any givenquestion No forgive the fact thatthere 's four questions on questionnumber one if I completely guess at itand there 's five choices what is theprobability that I 'm gon na get thatquestion right five choicesall right so learning from probabilitywe know that there 's only one way to getthe right answer and there 's fivechoices so the probability of getting aright answer is 1/5 right okay okay sothe probability of guessing on one ofthese questions just the first one okaythe probability of getting the rightanswer I 'm gon na call that probability Pokay just P so that 's what I 'm gonnacall it and I 'm gon na say that it'sequal to 1/5 because we just said thatat the probabilities 1/5 since there 's 5choices and we 're gon na go and convertthat to a decimal I think you canconvince yourself you put that in acalculator you 'll find out that theprobability 0.2 okay 1/5now what would be the probability of thewrong answer of guessing the wronganswer the probability of the wronganswer so again it 's just questionnumber 1it 's 1/5 that we got the right answerhow many choices how many wrong choicesare there there'sfor wrong choices in every singlequestion right so the probability ofgetting the wrong answer is pretty highfour-fifths because there 's four ways toget the wrong answer and only fivechoices so instead of using P I'vealready used that thing so I 'm gonnacall him Q and we already said that theprobability of Q getting the wronganswer is a is 4/5 but we also know thatQ is equal to one minus P and we knowthat it 's equal to 4/5 because we justsaid it 's equal to 4/5 in other words ifthe probability of the right answer is1/5 then the probability of the wronganswer is just 1 minus the probabilityof the right answer and we 've been doingthis this 1 minus business ever sincethe beginning of the probability so thatshould not look foreign to you okay ifit is go back and review that now soprobability a right probability of awrong and so you would guess this is 0.81 minus 0.2 0.8 right so far it hasn'tbeen rocket science so for for onequestion the first one on the test 1/5of being right 4/5 of being wrong okaynow the question I 'm going to ask youand actually the form of all of thesebinomial distribution things we 're goingto learn about the form of the questionsalways going to be like this what is thetotal probability for this particularproblem of guessing three out of four ofthe right answers of their otherquestions correctly so four questionsone two three four we know what theprobability of getting the questionsright and wrong is of each individualquestion but now that there 's fourquestions we just want to calculatewhat 's the total probability that test
