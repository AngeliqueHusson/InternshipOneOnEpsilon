Hello , everyone ! OK , I 've got a new one for you today.It 's one that I only learned myself last year.When I saw it , I was really impressed.It 's called `` Simpson 's Paradox . `` OK , it 's not about why it sucked after season nine.Or why the glove did n't fit.There you go ! Two references , fifteen years out of date.That 's a good way to start a video.No -- instead , you 're suffering from a mysterious , and embarrassing , illness , OK -- so , the best kind , really.There are two drugs to cure this illness -- Drug A , Drug B.So we put them on trial.On Day 1 , Drug A cures 63 out of 90 people.So , hurray ! Cures 63 out of 90 people.Or , in other words , it cures 70 % of people.Now , again , on Day 1 , Drug B cures 8 out of 10 people.So it cures 80 % of people.So on Day 1 , Drug B is winning . It cures 80 % of people , versus 70 % of people.Right . So Day 2 , we try the drugs again.On Day 2 , Drug A cures 4 out of 10 people.So , hurray.Right . Cures 4 out of 10 people , or to put it another way , it cures 40 % of people.Drug B , however , cures 45 out of 90 people , so it cures 50 % of people.So , again , Drug B wins . It cures 50 % of people , versus 40 % of people.So Drug B appears to be the better drug.It 's better on Day 1 , and it 's better on Day 2.But , have a look ! Overall -- overall , Drug A cures 63 people there , 4 people there , so it cures 67 out of 100 people.It cures 67 out of 100 people -- 67 % .Drug B , however , cures 8 people there , 45 people there , It cures 53 out of 100 people -- so it cures 53 % of people.So overall , Drug A appears to be better.It cures 67 % versus 53 % . So this is the paradox.Which is the better drug ? Drug B appears to be better on Day 1 , and better on Day 2 , but overall , Drug A appears to be better.Which is the better drug ? In fact , this paradox is fairly easy to solve.It 's Drug A.Drug A is the better drug.This is the result to use.The overall result -- it cures 67 % of people.Drug A is the better drug.Now , if you just follow the percentages alone , then you will come to the wrong conclusion.So if you just look at the 70 % , the 80 % , the 40 % and the 50 % , you will come to the wrong conclusionthat Drug B is the better drug.But you see , these things are weighted.They 're not the same.We 're not comparing like with like here.So we cured 63 out of 90 people there , and only 8 out of 10 people there.You 're not comparing the same thing.So it is this figurethat you should be using -- the overall result.Now , this is not just in medical trials.This turns up in sport statistics , exam results , all sorts of places.It 's really important to be able to interpretyour results correctly.Or otherwise , you 'll just end up sticking pins in peopleto cure people 's headaches , which would bea ridiculous thing to do ! So that 's all for now.And , if you have been , thanks for watching . test
