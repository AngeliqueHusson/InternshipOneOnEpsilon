Find the volume of a sphere with a diameter of 14 centimeters.So if I have a sphere -- so this is n't just a circle , this is a sphere.You could view it as a globe of some kind.So I 'm going to shade it a little bit so youcan tell that it's three-dimensional.They 're giving us the diameter.So if we go from one side of the spherestraight through the center of it.So we 're imagining that we can see through the sphere.And we go straight through the centimeter , that distance right over there is 14 centimeters.Now , to find the volume of a sphere -- and we 've proved this , or you will see a proof for this later when you learn calculus.But the formula for the volume of a sphereis volume is equal to 4/3 pi r cubed , where r is the radius of the sphere.So they 've given us the diameter.And just like for circles , the radius of the sphereis half of the diameter.So in this example , our radius is going to be 7 centimeters.And in fact , the sphere itself is the setof all points in three dimensions that is exactlythe radius away from the center.But with that out of the way , let 's justapply this radius being 7 centimeters to this formularight over here.So we 're going to have a volume isequal to 4/3 pi times 7 centimeters to the third power.So I 'll do that in that pink color.So times 7 centimeters to the third power.And since it already involves pi , and you could approximate pi with 3.14.Some people even approximate it with 22/7.But we 'll actually just get the calculator outto get the exact value for this volume.So this is going to be -- so my volume isgoing to be 4 divided by 3.And then I do n't want to just put a pi there , because that might interpret it as 4 divided by 3 pi.So 4 divided by 3 times pi , times 7 to the third power.In order of operations , it 'll do the exponentbefore it does the multiplication , so this should work out.And the units are going to be in centimeters cubed or cubiccentimeters.So we get 1,436.They do n't tell us what to round it to.So I 'll just round it to the nearest 10th -- 1,436.8.So this is equal to 1,436.8 centimeters cubed.And we 're done .
