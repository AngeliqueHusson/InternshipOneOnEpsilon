Okay , hours of fun to be had working out codes in two-one machinesand three-one machines and so on.In fact I had another flash of insight after that because I realizedI could also do a four-one machine or a five-one machine or a six-one machine.Crazy ! So what I want to do now is be extra crazyand go all the way up to something wild like a ten-one machine.In fact , lets be insane.Let 's put in 273 dots in a ten-one machine.What 's the code for this number going to be in this machine ? Wild.All right , first off , let me draw 273 dots.One , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight , nine , ten¡ªAlways the right most box remember.Eleven , twelve , thirteen , fourteen , fifteen , sixteen , seventeen , eighteen¡ªAll right , I guess I 'm going to be here a while.Dah dah dah dah dah ... 273 dots.Dah dah dah ... am I there yet ? [ tap tap tap on the board ] Okay , I 'm getting bored , is that close enough ? Close enough , we 'll say that 's 273 dots.Brilliant.All right , so I need to think my way through this slowly.I 'm a little bit slow on these things so here goes.First question , its just a yeso question.Will there be any explosions ? Well , yes , there will be explosions.In fact , how many explosions will there be among 273 dots ? Well , each group of ten explodes , I guess that makes what , twenty-seven explosions will occur ? And , any dots left behind ? Uh , yes , I bet three dots will be left behind.All right , so let 's do that.Let 's do twenty-seven explosions , Ka-boom , ka-thwow , ka-thwack , twenty-seven times.Oh-oh , so if twenty-seven explosions how many dots will appear here ? Well , each explosion makes a dot so I guess that makes twenty-seven dots here.Um , can I just write twenty-seven rather than draw the dots ? Is that okay ? All right , so twenty-seven explosions makes twenty-seven dots in the next box overleaving what we said three behind.Grand.Next questions , will there be any more explosions ? Why yes , I bet there 's what , two more explosions , leaving how many dots behind ? Probably seven behind.All right , two more explosions , ka-boom , ka-dot , and then seven behind.Oh , oh , look what we 've got.So what 's the secret code for the number 273 in a ten-one machine ? It 's two , seven , three.Whoa.What 's going on ? These machines are obviously doing something.In fact , you might already know what they 're doing.You might be cleverer than me.But that 's a good question , what are these machines actually doing ? The code for 273 in a ten-one machine is surprisingly 273.That 's our next job.Let 's figure out what these machines are actually doing.Wow , that 's going to be cool .
