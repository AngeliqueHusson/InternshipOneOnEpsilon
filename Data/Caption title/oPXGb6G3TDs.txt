what do you think will be the outcomewhen an even number is divided byanother even number consider the case of12 divided by 6 the quotient is 2 whichis even what about 20 over 4 it gives us5 which is odd and what about 10 dividedby 4 now we have a non integer so in thecase of an even number divided by aneven number we may get an even number oran odd number or a non integer thesecond case we can look at is odd / oddno matter what odd numbers you choosethe quotient can not be an even numbertry examples of odd / odd and you willsee that you do not get an even quotientin any case 15 over 5 both are odd andthe quotient is an odd number 15 over 7it will give us a non integer so in thecase of odd / odd we may get an oddquotient or a non integer but definitelynot an even integer the third case wewill consider is that of even by odd 6divided by 3 gives us an even number canwe get an odd number by dividing an evennumber by an odd one try out a fewexamples yourself and you will see thatthe result we get is never odd the logicis simple the numerator will be 2multiplied by something and as thedenominator is odd it will not have a 2so this 2 will surely remain no matterwhat hence even by odd can never be oddanother example of even by odd is 8 by 3which will result in a non integer thefourth and the final case we will lookat is odd / even this might surprise youall over even will only result in a nonintegerI say that so easily again plain logicthe factor two of the even number willremain in the denominator if we havesomething like 5 by 10 which is 5 by 2times 5 we can see that 2 remains if weare sure about getting a non integer wecan be sure that the quotient can not beeven or odd an example would be 3/8 oddover even it will always give us a noninteger Operations on Odd and Even Numbers - Division ( GMAT / GRE / CAT ) Operations on Odd and Even Numbers - Division ( GMAT / GRE / CAT ) Operations on Odd and Even Numbers - Division ( GMAT / GRE / CAT )
