know find area rectangle want video think find triangle starting right triangle degree angle right right triangle let think find area well maybe construct rectangle triangle construct rectangle maybe somehow find area part rectangle best way construct rectangle really duplicate flip put right top verify definitely rectangle know degree right let say x degree right x thing equal thing thing add let call let flip thing rotate around look like would another triangle would look like right angle version right angle right angle right x angle right angle right see x give right angle x give right angle four sides four right angle definitely dealing rectangle rectangle two original triangle write write area triangle area triangle bracket mean area triangle going equal area entire rectangle entire rectangle let add another point let call going area rectangle know find area rectangle going equal going equal base rectangle going equal part right let use different color area equal base width rectangle length b c parentheses n b c length segment right parentheses n get letter jumble going width base right times height rectangle times ad sorry times b base height give us area entire rectangle area right triangle half base height area right triangle general ever right triangle ever right triangle right angle right need one right angle order right triangle base length b side length h know area area going equal base triangle base triangle b c height triangle view way look actual letter point use measure base height base height works right right triangle let think type triangle n necessarily right triangle kind arbitrary triangle approach area wan na split two right triangle gon na draw perpendicular b gon na really actual structure literally drop something straight line going perpendicular base right c let call point let call point useful turned one triangle two right triangle say area let write way say area triangle wan na figure equal area character right equal area triangle area triangle area magenta triangle plus area useful know find area right triangle obviously degree also going degree area base height going base length ad ad height length b right assuming figure length b area blue triangle find area magenta triangle well right triangle gon na let magenta let magenta going length base right c length segment c length b factor factor b term b get b ad left ad shade blue left ad c close parenthesis ad c ad length length c length add two length get length c whole thing whole thing length c left area equal use new color equal switch order right gon na write color c b well base c height b pretty cool worked right triangle actually know height triangle n one sides right triangle one sides arbitrary triangle n know area triangle still base height triangle like figure area well let try thing let see somehow either construct right triangle maybe right triangle make another right triangle easiest way could kind drop rock right kind ground would form right angle let call point care wan na find wan na find area wan na find area triangle care triangle wan na find area area triangle gon na area right triangle set gon na triangle minus area smaller one right minus area ad c ad c blue one ad b whole thing whole thing clear talking area ad b well know find area right triangle ad b area ad b going going base b length segment b height length ad times ad wan na subtract area smaller triangle gonne base c length base c length height ad ad factor factor ad ad let factor ad left inside b c let put parenthesis white well take length b length whole thing subtract length c gon na left c b character right c c b area going equal c b switching order multiplication yellow color c b ad base height height case cause right triangle one sides someone would give information figure actual height form triangle area base height height kind sides right triangle easy figure given might tricky way figure height somehow anyway hope find useful triangle area proof perimeter area volume geometry khan academy triangle area proof perimeter area volume geometry khan academy triangle area proof perimeter area volume geometry khan academy triangle area proof perimeter area volume geometry khan academy triangle area proof perimeter area volume geometry khan academy triangle area proof perimeter area volume geometry khan academy triangle area proof perimeter area volume geometry khan academy triangle area proof perimeter area volume geometry khan academy triangle area proof perimeter area volume geometry khan academy triangle area proof perimeter area volume geometry khan academy triangle area proof perimeter area volume geometry khan academy
