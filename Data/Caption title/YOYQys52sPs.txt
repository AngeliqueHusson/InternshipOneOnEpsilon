We now know how to find the area of rectangles . What I want to do in this video , is think about how we can find the areas of triangles . So , we 're starting here with a right triangle , has a 90 degree angle right over here . Right triangle ABC . And let 's think about how we can find this area . Well , maybe we can construct a rectangle out of triangle ABC . And if we can construct a rectangle out if it , and then , maybe we can somehow find our area of part of that rectangle . And the best way to construct a rectangle is to really duplicate ABC , and then flip it over and put it right on top of this . And just to verify , that definitely will be a rectangle . So we know that this is 90 degrees right over here . Let 's say that this is x degrees right over there . We have x + 90 + this thing have to be equal to 180 . So , this thing and this thing have to add up to 90 . Let 's just call this 90-x . Now , let 's flip this thing and rotate it around , so that it will look like this . So , then you would have another triangle that would look just like this . Where now , this right angle , on the flipped version is that right angle right over there . This angle right over here , this x , is now this angle right over there . And this 90-x is now this angle , right over there . And you can see x + 90-x , that 'll give you a right angle . And then you have x + 90-x , that gives you a right angle . And you have four sides and four right angles , you 're definitely dealing with a rectangle . And this rectangle has two of our original triangles in it . So , we can write , we can write that the area of triangle ABC , the area of triangle ABC , that 's what the brackets mean , area of triangle ABC , is going to be equal to ? * the area of our entire rectangle . And our entire rectangle , let me add another point here . Let me call this D , is going to be ? the area of rectangle ABCD . And we know how to find the area of rectangle ABCD . It 's going to be equal to , it 's going to be equal to the base of the rectangle . So , this is going to be equal to ? * and so this part right over here . Let me just use a different color . The area of ABCD is equal to the base or the width of the rectangle . So , that 's just the length of BC . I 'm just putting this in parentheses , it does n't meanÄÅº I just , BC is just the length of this segment right over here I 'm just putting in the parentheses so that we do n't get the letters jumbled up . So it 's going to be this width or this base right here times the height of the rectangle . So , times AD . TimesÄÅº sorry , times AB . So , it 's this base * this height gives us the area of the entire rectangle . And the area of a right triangle is half of that . So , there we have it . It 's ? * this base * this height . It 's the area of a right triangle . So , in general if you ever have a right triangle , if you ever have a right triangle , and this is a right angle right over there which is , you need one right angle in order for it to be a right triangle . And this base has length B , and this side over here has length H. You know that the area , the area is going to be equal to ? * the base of the triangle . That 's the base of the triangle BC * the height of the triangle . So you can view it this way , if you look at the actual letter points . And if you just use these measures as a base * height , it 's just ? base * height . And we only that this works right now for a right triangle . Now , let 's think about it for other types of triangles that are n't necessarily right triangles . So , here I have a kind of an arbitrary triangle ABC . And to approach figuring out its area , what I wan na do is just split this up into two right triangles . So what I 'm gon na do is draw a perpendicular from B , so I 'm just gon na really , if this was , if this was an actual structure , you 'll just literally drop something straight down from here , and that line is going to be perpendicular to this base right over here , to AC . And let me call that point , let me call that point D. And what 's useful here is now we 've constructed , we 've turned that one triangle into two right triangles . So we can say that the area , let me write it this way , we can say the area of triangle ABC , that 's what we wan na figure out . It 's equal to the area of this character right here . So it 's equal to the area of triangle ABD + the area of triangle , + the area of this magenta triangle . So , plus the area of BCD , of BCD . And this is useful because we know how to find the area of right triangles . Now , obviously this is 90 degrees and this is also going to be 90 degrees . The area of ABD is ? base * height . So it 's going to be ? * the base , which is the length AD . So ? * AD , * the height , which is the length of BD right over here , assuming that we can figure that out . So this * that length , so , BD . So that 's the area of the blue triangle , and I 'll find the area of the magenta triangle . Well , once again it 's a right triangle . It 's gon na be ? , let me do that in magenta . Let me do that in magenta . So it 's going to be ? * the length of this base right over here , which is DC , the length of segment DC * the length of BD again . Now , you can factor out a ? , we can factor out a ? BD from both of these terms , ? BD . So you get ? BD * AD , we 're left with AD , and that 's not the same shade of blue . We 're left with AD + DC . We close the parenthesis . And what is AD + DC ? AD is the length , that length . And then DC is this length . So if you will add those two lengths , you get the length of AC . So this whole thing , this whole thing is the length AC . So , we 're left with the area of ABC is equal to , I 'll use in a new color , it 's equal to ? , and I 'll just switch the orders right over here . ? * , which I 'm gon na write in that same color , * AC * BD . Now , what is this again ? Well , this is now ? * the base , which is this AC , * the height , which is BD . So that 's pretty cool . It worked for right triangles , and it actually , if we know the height of a triangle . Now , this is n't one of the sides now . For a right triangle , it was one of the sides . Now , for this arbitrary triangle , it is n't . But if we know it , the area of this triangle is still ? * the base * the height . Now , what about a triangle like this ? How can we figure out its area ? Well , let 's try doing the same thing . Let 's see if we can somehow , either construct this out of right triangles , or maybe out a right triangle of this to make it into another right triangle . And the easiest way to do that is , we could kind of just drop a rock from right over there . And then this , and then where it kind of hits the ground would form a right angle . And let 's call this point D. And what we care about , what we wan na find in this , what we wan na find the area of , we wan na find the area of triangle ABC . So that 's what we care about . Triangle ABC is what we wan na find the area . But the area of triangle ABC is gon na be the area of this larger right triangle that we 've set up . That 's gon na be this larger triangle . Minus the area of this smaller one right over here . So , minus the area of ADC , of ADC . So I just , this blue one ADB , this is just the whole thing . This is the whole thing , just so we 're clear of what we 're talking about . Now , what is the area of ADB . Well , we know how to find the area of right triangles . ADB , the area of ADB is going to be , is going to be ? * our base , which is DB , the length of segment DB * our height , which is the length of AD . Times AD . And then from that we wan na subtract the area of the smaller triangle . So that 's gonne be ? * our base , which is DC , that 's the length of our base , DC , * the length of our height , which is AD , AD . So , here we can factor out a ? , and we can factor an AD . A ? , and an AD , so let 's do that . So we factor out a ? * AD . And what 's left inside is a DB - a DC . Let me put the parenthesis in a white again . Well , if you take the length , DB is the length of this whole thing . You subtract from that the length DC , you 're gon na be left with CB . So this character right over here , this is C , this is CB . And so the area of ABC is going to be equal to ? * CB , I 'm just switching the order of multiplication , with a yellow color . ? * CB * AD Now , what is this ? Once again , it 's ? * our base * our height . And once again the height in this case , 'cause it 's not a right triangle , it 's not one of the sides . Someone would have to give you that information . You 'd have to figure out what this actual height is . But what 's needed is , in any form of triangle the area is ? base * height . The height is , kind of , if you have the sides of a right triangle , it 's easy to figure out . For these others , if it 's not given , you might have to do it in some tricky way , figure out the height somehow . But anyway , I hope that you find that useful .
