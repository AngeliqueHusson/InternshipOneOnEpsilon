Hi ! Welcome to Math Antics . In this lesson , we are gon na learn about long division . If you havenâ€™t already watched our video about basic division , then be sure to go back and watch that first . It will make learning long division a lot easier . Long division is just a way of breaking up a bigger division problem into a series of short division steps like the ones that we did in the basic division video . The nice thing about long division is that once you know the procedure , you can divide up all kinds of numbers , even if they are REALLY big . The key to long division is to think about our division problem digit-by-digit . If our dividend ( the number weâ€™re dividing up ) has a lot of digits , then that means that there will be a lot of division steps to do . When we learned basic one-step division , all of the dividends were small enough that we could just use the multiplication table to help us find the answer . But what if we have a division problem like this ? 936 divided by 4 936 is definitely NOT on our multiplication table ! In fact , thereâ€™s not anything even close to 936 , so what do we do ? Well , instead of trying to divide the entire 936 by 4 all at once , letâ€™s break this problem up into smaller steps by just trying to divide each digit by 4 , one digit at a time â€¦digit-by-digit . Do you remember how with multi-digit multiplication and addition , we always start with the smallest digit ( the ones place digit ) and we work from right to left ? Well division is backwards ! We still go digit by digit , but the other way . We start by trying to divide up the digit in the biggest number place first and we work our way from left to right . So the first step in this problem is to divide the FIRST digit of our dividend by 4 . Weâ€™ll just ignore the other digits for now , and that makes it look like we have the division problem 9 divided by 4 . Great ! Thatâ€™s easy ! Itâ€™s just a basic division problem like in the last video . So we ask , â€œHow many â€˜4â€™s will it take to make 9 or almost 9 ? â€ Well , two â€˜4â€™s would be 8 , and thatâ€™s almost 9 . So just like before , we put the 2 in our answer spot on top of the line . But wait a minuteâ€¦ thereâ€™s a lot of room up there . Where exactly do we put it ? Well , the answer digit should always go directly above the digit weâ€™re dividing . Since weâ€™re dividing the digit 9 , our 2 should go right above the 9 . Okay , now we multiplyâ€¦ 2 times 4 is 8 , and the 8 goes below the 9 so that we can subtract to get our remainder . 9 minus 8 is 1 , so our remainder is 1 . Now at this point in our basic one-step division problems , we would re-write our remainder up in our answer with a little â€˜râ€™ next to it . But we arenâ€™t going to do that yet because this is long division and we still have more digits to divide ( the ones weâ€™ve been ignoring ) . Since weâ€™re going digit-by-digit , letâ€™s stop ignoring the next digit in our dividend ( the 3 ) . Now you might think that our next division step is to divide that 3 by the 4 . But itâ€™s not quite that simple . We had a remainder from our last division step , and we canâ€™t just forget about that . We need to combine that remainder with our next digit and divide them both together . We do that by bringing down a COPY of the next digit ( the 3 ) and put it right beside the remainder ( which is 1 ) . When we do that , it looks like our remainder is 13 . Itâ€™s kind of like our remainder is teaming up with the next digit over . And if you think about it , that makes sense because the digits that we were ignoring during our first division step really are part of the remainder , because we still need to divide them . Okay , so bringing down that next digit makes our remainder bigger . And thatâ€™s good because before , the remainder was so small that 4 couldnâ€™t divide into it . But now itâ€™s 13 , and 4 will divide into 13 . So we ask , â€œHow many â€˜4â€™s will it take to make 13 ? â€ Well , three â€˜4â€™s would be 12 , and thatâ€™s really close without being too big . So letâ€™s put 3 in our answer line . Yep - it goes right over the 3 because that is the next digit we were dividing in this digit-by-digit process . And then 3 times 4 is 12 which we put right below the 13 so that we can subtract to get the next remainder which will also be 1 . See how weâ€™re just repeating the basic division procedure ? But weâ€™re going further down the screen as we do . Alright , now that we have a new remainder , itâ€™s time for our next division step . Letâ€™s stop ignoring the last digit in the dividend ( the 6 ) and bring down a copy of it to team up with our new remainder . Together , they form a remainder of 16 . Ah ha ! Thatâ€™s good because itâ€™s gon na be easy to divide 4 into 16 because 16 is a multiple of 4 . It takes exactly fours â€˜4â€™s to make 16 . So we put a 4 in the last place of our answer line , and then we write the 16 below our new remainder . Now if we subtract 16 from 16 , we see that our last remainder will be zero , which means thereâ€™s no remainder left . Thatâ€™s great ! We solved the whole division problem digit-by-digit by breaking it up into three basic division steps . And now we know that 936 divided by 4 equals 234 . And we also know why they call it long division ! ! In fact , that was so long , I think I need a coffee breakâ€¦ Oh manâ€¦ that was some looooooooooooong division ! Wheewâ€¦ letâ€™s seeâ€¦ Okay , so that problem had a three-digit dividend and it also had three division steps . But the number of steps isnâ€™t always the same as the number of digits we have . And thatâ€™s because the number of steps also depends on how big our divisor is . To see what I mean , letâ€™s work two division problems side by side . These both look like the basic one-step division problems that you did in the last video , donâ€™t they ? But as youâ€˜ll see , one of them is actually a two-step problem . Letâ€™s start with the first problem : 72 divided by 8 . We just ask , â€œHow many â€˜8â€™s does it take to make 72 ( or almost 72 ) ? â€ Well thatâ€™s easy ! On our multiplication table you can see that 72 is a multiple of 8 . 8 Ã— 9 = 72 So we put 9 in our answer line , and we write 72 below , and we see that we have no remainder . Now letâ€™s try the next problem : 72 divided by 3 . If we ask , â€œHow many â€˜3â€™s will it take to make 72 ( or almost 72 ) ? â€ , we can see that the answer is not on our multiplication chart . The biggest multiple of three listed there is 30 which isnâ€™t even close . The reason is that this should really be a two-step problem . Letâ€™s try using the new digit-by-digit method we just learned . Instead of asking , â€œHow many â€˜3â€™s make 72 ? â€ , letâ€™s just focus on the first digit and ask , â€œHow many â€˜3â€™s does it take to make 7 ? â€ Ah - thatâ€™s easy . Two â€˜3â€™s would give us 6 , which is very close . So letâ€™s put a 2 in the answer line right above the 7 . Then we multiply 2 times 3 , and that makes 6 . And we subtract 6 from 7 to get a remainder of 1 . Now for the second stepâ€¦ We bring down a copy of the next digit ( the 2 ) and we combine it with the 1 to get a new remainder of 12 . Then we ask , â€œHow many â€˜3â€™s does it take to make 12 ? â€ and the answer to that is exactly 4 . So we write a 4 in the answer line , and 3 Ã— 4 = 12 . 12 âˆ ’ 12 = 0 So we have no remainder ! Weâ€™re done ! 72 divided by 3 is 24 . Now hereâ€™s the interesting thing about these examples . The first problem could have been a two-step problem also . If we had taken it digit-by-digit , we would have first asked , â€œHow many â€˜8â€™s does it take to make 7 ( or almost 7 ) ? â€ But the answer would have been zero since 8 is too big to divide into 7 . We would have put zero in our answer line and the remainder would have just been 7 . So basically , we just skipped that step . And thatâ€™ll happen with digit-by-digit division sometimes . If the number is too small to divide into , you just put a zero in the answer line and you move on to the next digit . Okay , now that you know the procedure for long division , are you ready to see a really long problem ? Good - I thought so ! Letâ€™s divide 315,270 by 5 . Now donâ€™t worryâ€¦ itâ€™s really not that hard if you just go digit-by-digit . Iâ€™m gon na work the problem pretty fast , so donâ€™t worry if you donâ€™t follow all the math . Just focus on the repeating division process as we go along . Are you ready ? The first digit is 3 . How many times will 5 divide into 3 ? Zero . 5 is too big . So letâ€™s just skip that step and combine our first digit with our next digit . So how many times does 5 divide into 31 ? Six . 6 times 5 is 30 . And 31 minus 30 gives us a remainder of 1 . Now on to the third digitâ€¦ We bring a copy of it down to join with the remainder . And we ask how many times will 5 divide into 15 ? Three . 3 times 5 is 15 . And 15 minus 15 is zero . On to the next digitâ€¦ Now even though our previous remainder was zero , we still bring down a copy of the next digit . Now we ask how many times will 5 divide into 2 ? Zero . 5 is too big , so we need to move on to the next digit and bring a copy of it down also . There , thatâ€™s better . Now we ask , how many times will 5 divide into 27 ? Five . 5 times 5 is 25 . And 27 minus 25 gives a remainder of 2. â€¦now for that last digit , which is a zero . And you might wonder , â€œWhy do we even have to bring a copy of a zero down ? Isnâ€™t that nothing ? â€ But the zero is an important place holderâ€¦ and when we bring a copy of it down , it changes our remainder of 2 into a remainder of 20 . Now thatâ€™s a big difference ! Now we ask , how many times will 5 divide into 20 ? Four . 4 times 5 is 20 . And 20 minus 20 is zero . Yes ! Weâ€™re done ! Thereâ€™s no more digits to divide . And you can see that our final answer is : 63,054 . Alrightâ€¦ thatâ€™s the procedure for long division . As you can see , itâ€™s kinda complicated , so donâ€™t get discouraged if youâ€™re confused at first . Like almost everything , it just takes practice . So , as you get ready to practice some long division problems on your own , hereâ€™s a few tips that will help you out . First : If you havenâ€™t already done it , memorizing your multiplication table will really help with division . Second : When youâ€™re working problems , itâ€™s really important to write neatly and stay organized . If your writing is messy , it might be hard to keep your columns lined up and that could lead to mistakes . And if thatâ€™s the case , try using graph paper to help keep things lined up . Third : Start with some smaller two or three-digit dividends so you only have a few division steps to do . Then work up to the longer problems . And last of all : After each practice problem you do , check your answer with a calculator . That will let you know right away if youâ€™ve made any mistakes so you can correct them , and most importantly , learn from them . And it will give you practice with a calculator , which is also important . Alright , thatâ€™s all for this lesson . Thanks for watching Math Antics , and Iâ€™ll see ya next time .
