Okay , so here 's another little fun problemSince the division problem turned out to be so much fun the multiplication and division one . Here 's another one thatSomebody pointed out to meso I think it'sjust I do n't know let 's take a look soSo negative twenty wellThat certainly equals negative 20 no arguments there , I thinkLet 's break up negative 20 . I 'm gon na break it up on the leftI think I 'm gon na write that as 16 minus 36 certainly you still get negative 20 there andOn the right side . I 'm gon na write that as 25minus 45 okay , soNow I 'm gon na rewrite things a little bit moreI 'm gon na rewrite 16 is 4 squared and then I 'm Gon na rewrite 36 as 4 times 9On the right side . I 'm gon na rewrite 25 as just 5 squared and then I 'm Gon na rewrite 45 as5 times 9 andAlright , well , I think what I 'm gon na . Do now is I 'm Gon na addTo both sides and the number that I 'm gon na add to both sides is I 'm Gon na add 81 over 4All right , so that 's what we 've got so farwell actually I think we can factor this now a little bit , sowe can do a couple things here andYou know you can you can check that this all works , so I 'm gon na leave the 4 squared aloneWe can just rewrite4/9 pretty easily , I 'm Gon na write that as 2 Times 4times 9 over 2 so I 'm just breaking up the 4 over 9 here a little bit andthen I 'm Gon na rewrite 81 over 4 as9 Over 2Squared on the right side . I 'm gon na do the same thing . So we 've got 5 squaredWhat I 'm gon na do here is I 'm gon na write this as 2 times 5Times 9 over 2 and then plus 9 over 2 squaredOkay , so you know we 're just basically just the Tube and the nine halves would cancel hey give us back our or our nine thatWe had up there so all right so far so good well the reason why we do . This is this now factors nicelythis actually factors as 4 minus 9 over 2Times 4 minus 9 over 2And the right side is gon na factor as 5 5 minus 9 over 2Times 5 minus 9 over 2All right , wellWhat that tells us is well . We 've got 4 minus 9 over 2squared that equals5 minus 9 Over 2Squared and now well that means 4 minus 9 over 2 equals 5 minus9 over 2 andwell , we could add 9 over 2 to both sides so that tells us that 4 equals 5 and well if we subtract 4 fromboth sidesThat now tells us that 0 equals 1 so proof complete A Proof that 0 = 1  (Can You Spot the Mistake?) A Proof that 0 = 1  (Can You Spot the Mistake?) A Proof that 0 = 1  (Can You Spot the Mistake?)
