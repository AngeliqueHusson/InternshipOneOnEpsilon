let talk four color theorem favorite easy state statement every map colored four colors two neighboring different colors would wasnt map done four word saying map need five colors obvious youd think complicated map would need colors apparently map done four colors problem unsolved long year unsolved solve finally method used solve little controversial time large effect mathematics today story problem came around kind cute apparently guy trying color dont know trying suspected could four brother brother math student brother lecturer man cal led august us de famous mathematician well de morgan spread problem around prove either need show every map done four colors better need find one example needs five colors people trying try map work try map world color four colors try map united four colors try real map four mean get problem right want keep quiet start maybe ill need invent map maybe invent weird complicated find one needs five colors thats start doesnt look like sort real life map got map going color let start middle think orange next country different color purple try next country fairly simple cant use purple cant use orange theyre touching ill use blue next one u h want want well cant use blue orange r grime oh could use purple grime ah wise wise use purple let go expense fourth let use blue grime use blue one excellent might put us good position next country weve got cant use blue cant use purple use orange r grime use orange wan na use orange opposite one well one need fourth grime need go fourth color yeah yeah yep purple blue orange used go fourth got pink opposite side obviously ill use pink look like use four colors map solvable four another important map gon na make like theres try color ill something similar ill orange middle purple well one cant purple cant orange mean blue country cant orange cant bepurple cant blue forced touse fourth color pink example map definitely needs four colors going boil problem little bit let say took map ill draw map instead coloring section let say colorin center get idea wont use ink maybe instead drawing whole map maybe said two touching share right ill connect line made turn map network map made network question map colored four colors better question saying network colored four colors better two connected line color kind boil problem make abstract thats actually good thing easier solve learn map instead reason want use start two map ill show mean look like yeah map look like handbag told draw network map going dot region ill connect theyre connected like find get network previous map give network effectively map even though look different study different kind map even look different map network ill show mean going valid map say theyre going touching theyre mutually share like got right look like going valid map try turn map going work problem cross try turn map doesnt make sense try doesnt make sense untangle might happen ill show mean say let say touch well would connect line see cross dont way could drawn line like could untangled untangle thats fine thats valid map map learn looking one particular map going country let scall country right theres going country every map thats either like country connected one country might happen country connected two get network like country middle might country connected seem perfectly reasonable thats center country could connected put country could connected every map one country look like one cant every country connected six saying one country map thats either connected one two three four five map theyre mutually connected six thats network cant untangled map feature one one list start talking four color theorem actually going useful four color theorem hard prove tried long time like took year manage easier version four color theorem four color theorem map need five probably prove need seven colors thats probably easier explain go imagine map need seven colors map cant done better right map pick one youve got small one map going contain country going one cal led list country pull delete take away youve made smaller map smaller map mean six colors remember map use seven take country away smaller doit six great put country aback mean spare color use mean worst case scenario last one could different colors put back still going color sixth color use show map done six colors show map done five colors thats little bit harder proof exactly proof exactly except end um becomes harder five different colors put country back might color dont want argument bit complicated show recolor still spare color harder proof along try four show map done four colors argument doesnt quite work wasnt strong enough went unsolved long time people thought proved thought actually done people accepted proof thought solve decade thought oh done oh found actually doesnt holdup oh wasnt go back square one find way prove problem took till solve problem final solution done two guy ken neth university kind similar proof made list said every map must least one sho wed every one one colored four colors colored four colors enough every map done four colors hard proof apart problem show list could colored four colors long list many list sic used computer controversial time first computer assis ted proof mathematics commonplace lots mathematics done first people wary proof astart one problem lots case thats best kind proof proof valid problem doesnt give understanding something true case mathematician necessarily like kind proof best kind still valid proof proof improve long list show could color got think like something think shorter sure short moment though proof massive check ing still beautiful proof episode brought get ten percent first order going pretty much every day maintain sort thing line store sort great one setup everything right buy ing domain name start designing page got award winning template theyre really good tweak see fit course importantly look equally good mobile device taken care whatever next move line square space going make much easier also look much professional give really doesnt matter days whether sort c v type site kind shop really need classy thats going get go check even free trial remember use get ten percent first use code thanks supporting video four color map theorem four color map theorem four color map theorem four color map theorem four color
