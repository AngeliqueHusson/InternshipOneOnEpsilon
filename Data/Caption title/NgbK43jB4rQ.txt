So let 's talk about the four color theorem ! It 's a favorite with mathematicians.It 's easy to state , so the statement is , every map can be colored using four colors , such that two neighboring countries are different colors.That would be confusing if it wasn't.So all maps can be done in four colors.In other words I 'm saying there are no maps that need five colors.It 's not obvious , and you 'd think more complicated maps would need more colors , but apparently all maps can be done with just four colors or better.So this problem was unsolved for a long time.125 years , it was unsolved.It was solved finally in the 1970s , although the method they used to solve it was a little controversial at the time , but has had a large effect on mathematics today.So the story of how this problem came around is kind of cute.Apparently there was a guy who was trying to color in the counties of Britain.I do n't know why he was trying to do that , but he was , and he suspected he could do it using four colors.And he mentioned it to his brother , and his brother was a Maths student.And his brother mentioned it to his lecturer who was a man called Augustus De Morgan.He 's a famous mathematician , and , well , it was De Morgan who spread this problem around.So to prove it , we either need to show that every map can be done with four colors or better , or we just need to find one example that needs five colors.So people were trying it.And if you try it with maps , it does work.If you try it with the map of the world , you can color it with four colors.If you try it with the map of the United States , you can do it with four colors.You can try any real map , you can do it with four colors.I mean you can get this problem to children , right , you want to keep them quiet.After a while , you start to think , '' Well , maybe I 'll need to invent a map.Maybe if I can invent a weird , complicated map , I can find one that needs five colors . `` So that 's what you start to do -- does n't look like any sort of real-life map.So we got this map , and now we 're going to color it in.So let 's start with the middle ; I think orange.Next country has to be a different color , so I 'm using the purple here.Let 's try the next country ; so this is all fairly simple -- I ca n't use purple , I ca n't use orange , because they 're touching -- I 'll use the blue.Next one , uh , what do you want , what do you want , Brady ? [ Brady ] Well , we ca n't use blue or orange ... [ Dr. Grime ] Mm . [ Brady ] Oh we could use purple again ! [ Dr . Grime ] Ah , wise . That is a wise choice.Let 's use purple again.Why not ? Let 's not go to the expense of using a fourth color.So now let 's do this one . [ Brady ] We can use blue again. [ Dr . Grime ] And we can use blue again for that one , excellent.That might put us in a good position when we do the next country.So here we 've got -- we ca n't use blue , we ca n't use purple ; what should we use ? [ Brady ] We can use orange again . [ Dr. Grime ] We can use orange , why not ? Uh , do you wan na use the orange on the opposite one ? So we 'll do this one in orange ... [ Brady ] And now we need a fourth color. [ Dr . Grime ] We do need -- we have to go to the fourth color , do we ? Yeah , yeah , yep , purple , blue and orange are being used ; this does have to go into the fourth color.I 've got pink here . On the opposite side , it 's the same , obviously ; I 'll use pink over here.It looks like we had to use four colors for that.So okay , so this is a mapthat was solvable with four colors.Here 's another important map . I 'm gon na makeit like that . There 's only fourcountries , but if we try and color it in , Uh , I 'll do something similar . I 'll dothe orange in the middle again , purple up here.Well this one ca n't be purple ; itca n't be orange . That means it 's blue and thiscountry it ca n't be orange ; it ca n't bepurple ; it ca n't be blue ; so I 'm forced touse the fourth color which is the pink.So this is an example of a map thatdefinitely needs four colors so we'regoing to boil the problem down a littlebit . Let 's say I took this map again -- I'lldraw it here . Same map . Instead of coloring inall the sections , let 's just say I colorin at the center of each region.That 'll just get the same idea wo n't it ? I don'thave to use all that ink . and maybeinstead of drawing out the whole mapmaybe if I just said if two countriesare touching each other , they share aborder . Right , I 'll just connect them witha line . What I 've made is I turn thatmap into a network so this map has madethis network and the question `` Can thismap be colored using four colors orbetter ? '' is the same question of saying '' can this network be colored using fourcolors or better such that two countriesthat are connected with a line are notthe same color ? '' So it kind of boils downthe problem ; it makes it more abstractbut that 's actually a good thing . itmakes it easier to solve , there arethings we can learn now about maps bystudying networks instead . So the reasonwe want to use networks ; for a start , itshows when two maps are the same . I'llshow you what I mean . What about if I had amap that looks like this yeah so thisthis map looks like a handbag as Bradyjust told me , but if we draw the networkfor this map , so I 'm just going to puta dot in each region and then I'llconnect them if they 're connected likethis . You will find that you get the samenetwork as this previous map we did . Sojust 4 countries again , it gives me thesame network -- it is effectively the same mapeven though it looks different . So bystudying networks we can study all thedifferent kinds of maps even when theylook different . Now all maps makenetworks but not all network are validmaps . I 'll show you what I mean this isnot going to be a valid map and I'mgoing to say they 're all going to be touchingeach other . They 're all mutually touchingcountries . They all share borders so itlooks like -- if I got this right -- looks likethat . Now this is not going to be a validmap , because if you try and turn thatinto a map it 's not going to work . Theproblem is the lines cross which whenyou try and turn it into a map doesn'tmake sense . You can try but it justdoes n't make sense . It is allowed if wecan untangle the lines and that mighthappen . i 'll show you what i mean so saythese are countries here and let 's saythese countries touch each other as wellso i would connect them with a line , butif I do that you see the lines cross . Ido n't have to do it that way : I couldhave drawn a line like that . So I couldhave untangled that . So if I can untangle itthat 's fine . That 's a valid map . And bystudying networks there are some featuresof maps that we can learn by looking atnetworks , this one in particular . In anymap you 're going to have a country let'scall it A . Country A . Right , there 's goingto be a country in every map that'seither just by itself , like anisland , or country A is connected to oneother country ; that might happen.Or country A is connected to two othercountries , so you 'll get a network thatlooks like that . That 'd be country Athere in the middle , or you might havecountry A which is connected to threecountries , this all seems perfectlyreasonable . That 's A in the center . Country Acould be connected to 4 countries , ( now put A in ) , or country A could be connectedto 5 countries . And that all seemsreasonable , but every map will have atleast one country that looks like one ofthese . What you ca n't have is everycountry connected to six other countriesor more . All I 'm saying is there is atleast one country in that map that'seither connected to one , or two , or three , or four , or five . But if you have a mapwhere they 're all mutually connected tosix or more countries , that 's a networkthat ca n't be untangled . So all maps havethis feature one of the countries is oneof these on this list . Now we can starttalking about the four color theoremthis is actually going to be useful . So thefour color theorem is hard to prove andthey tried for a long time , like I saidit took 125 years . They did manage toprove easier versions of the four colortheorem . So the four color theorem meansthere are no maps that need five colors.I can probably prove that there are nomaps that need seven colors . That'sprobably easier to explain okay . I'mgoing to have a go . Okay imagine thereare maps that need seven colors . Theseare maps that ca n't be done with better , right , so there are maps that needseven . Pick the smallest one , okay , soyou 've got a small one . Now , because it'sa map it 's going to contain a countrywhich is going to be one of these A'sthat I 've called here on this list . Sotake that country and pull it out , justdelete it , take it away . you 've made asmaller map . Now , because it 's a smallermap , that means you can do it in sixcolors . Do you remember , the map I had wasthe smallest that had to use seven ? So ifI take a country away , smaller , I can doit with six , great . If I put my country Aback in , that means i have a spare colorto use for A. I mean the worst casescenario is this last one here . and thesecould be all different colors . If Iput A back in I 'm still going to have aspare color , a sixth color that i can use , which shows that the map can be done insix colors after all . Now to show thatall maps can be done with five colors -- that 's a little bit harder , the proof isexactly the same , the proof is exactlythe same except , in this worst-casescenario , down here at the end here umit becomes harder , because if those arefive different colors , and you put yourcountry A back in , you might have toreuse a color which you do n't want to do.So the argument 's a bit more complicated.you have to show that you can recolor it , and you still have a spare color for A.So it 's a harder proof but it 's alongthe same lines . Then , they try to do itwith four ; can we show that all maps canbe done with four colors ? And thatargument does n't quite work . It justwas n't strong enough . So this wentunsolved for a long time . There were somepeople who thought they 'd proved it . Theythought they 'd actually done it andpeople accepted the proof , and theythought it was solved for a decade . Wethought `` Oh ! It 's done . '' And then oh ! They found amistake and when actually that does n't holdup and then `` Oh no , it was n't proved . `` And we have to go back to square one , we haveto find a way to prove this problem . Soit took till the 1970s to solve thisproblem . So the final solution : it wasdone by two guys , Kenneth Appel andWolfgang Haken from the University ofIllinois.They did it in 1976 . It 's kind of similar to my proof Imentioned before . They made a list ofnetworks and they said , every map musthave at least one of these networkswithin it . And they showed that every mapcontains one of these networks . Each oneof those networks can be colored withfour colors or can be recolored withfour colors . And that -- that is enough toshow that every map can be done withfour colors . Now it is a hard proof and apart of the problem was having to showthat this list could be colored withfour colors because it was a long list.There were -- how many networks was on thislist ? 1,938 [ sic ] networks , and to do that theyused a computer . And that wascontroversial at the time . This was thefirst computer assisted proof inmathematics . Now it 's commonplace andlots of mathematics is done withcomputers , but this was the first , andpeople were wary of this proof . For astart , one of the problems is -- it involveschecking lots of cases . That 's not thebest kind of proof . It is a proof and it isvalid , but the problem with that is itdoes n't give you a deeper understandingof why something is true : just checkinglots of cases . Mathematicians not -- do notnecessarily like that kind of proof ; it'snot the best kind . But it 's still a validproof . The proof has been improved forstarts , we had this long list of networksthat we had to show we could color in.That got shortened . I think it gotshortened to some like 1400 andsomething -- I think it 's shorter now . I'mnot sure how short it is at the moment.At the moment though the proof stillrequires this massive checking of cases , so it 's still not a beautiful proof.This episode has been brought to you bySquarespace ; get ten percent off yourfirst order with them by going tosquarespace.comumberphile .
