marc us u quite incompleteness theorem many year kind place extraordinary limitation might able know mathematics fact quite un nerving theorem heart say might conjecture example something like conjecture might actually true might true every even number sum two maybe within axiomatic system mathematics proof real worry theres true statement working away actually doesnt proof big kind revelation mathematics think ever since ancient believe true statement mathematics proof might quite difficult find like last theorem took year colleague ox ford drew wile found proof think kind feeling like well surely every true statement proof show actually theres gap truth proof wrote quite cute one card statement side card false let suppose thats true mean statement side card false turn say statement side card true well thats meant false mean one side also false oh suppose true thats false side true mean get kind infinite loop verbal paradox es fine dont expect every verbal sentence truth value went university realize mathematics cant yet took course mathematical logic learned incompleteness theorem used kind self referential statement really undermine belief true statement could proved feeling like able prove mathematics something cal led consistent mathematics wont give rise contradiction kind inspired certain kind little paradox es people like russel l come people might come across idea set set dont contain member challenge well set set actually really nice kind version another sort mathematical kind verbal paradox defined less word example taxicab number hardy tal ked define less word number sum two two different ways less word define following number number defined less word think count add defined number less word go well thats bit worrying surely sort kind number might define number certain property real feeling paradox es set theoretic paradox es beginning real challenge mathematics turn century avid one big problem challenge mathematics century big unsolved problem second one prove mathematics fact consistent included every true statement provable shock got actually year later along comes logician blow idea prove math consistent water show true statement cant proved within mathematical system mathematics work set thing cal led axiom kind thing believe way geometry works example take six add seven dont think going different taking seven six seem blindingly obvious thats one axiom way work maybe somewhere goes wrong dont really care interested mathematics true rule allow make deduction axiom thats mathematics works time make logical deduction expand conclusion axiom add new axiom feel like know havent actually capture whole mathematics somehow mission want set axiom strong enough believe basic deduce statement proof feeling like well yeah well maybe havent got axiom got true statement cant proved could add new axiom expand prove within mathematics important trying prove set axiom deduce truth mathematics something clever coo ked way mathematics talk produced thing cal led cod ing sho wed statement particular code number fact use prime order make cod ing every statement mathematics could turned number example axiom mathematics trying make deduction would code true statement mathematics example last theorem example code number also false statement like even number code number k code look like theyre obviously theyre absolutely huge unique cod ing every code number worked backwards statement every number meaningful mathematical statement interesting way every mathematical statement unique number associated bit like thing computer good away write name change ascii code number associated coo ked useful actually talk proof mathematics start talk mathematics mathematics example might want know well particular statement provable axiom going completely simplify give feel essentially bit like saying statement whose code number divisible code number axiom provable axiom thats incredible simplification good mean talk proof within mathematically say something provable say example code number must divisible axiom challenge following statement statement proved axiom system mathematics actually something code number talk proof statement change mathematical equation mean equation mathematics either true false let start saying statement false mean statement provable axiom true provable statement must true weve star ted something assumed false weve deduce true weve got contradiction assuming mathematics consistent cant contradiction important mean cant false mean must true mathematical statement either true false like linguistic paradox es dont truth value equation mathematics either true false weve shown false lead contradiction mean statement must true ah great weve got true statement let reinterpret say say statement proved axiom got true statement proved true axiom mathematics thats exactly wan ted got statement mathematics true proved go hold actually prove true proved true important articulate done within system mathematics certain axiom found true statement within cant proved true within system weve proved true working outside system looking add axiom true statement wont make something consistent inconsistent could add axiom say well weve got proof axiom one kind infinite regress es say thats going help still cook within new system another statement true unprovable sort infinite regress thing say matter much expand mathematics axiom always missing something little bit like remember proof infinitely many say suppose finitely many prove theres missing list say well ill add keep trick well thats still good enough still thing missing similar kind feel might try expand mathematics add axiom wont help keep game like though problem restricted little self referential corner like doesnt feel like put gold bach reach thing reach one little game play mathematician hope theres weird logical sentence really dont really much mathematical content think people hoped thing like gold bach would one hope really blown away mathematician came statement think kind like gold bach nature think well yeah thats something id want able prove true sho wed sentence true provable within quite standard system mathematics weve discovered cant hope weird self referential sentence going could gold bach could gold bach twin might also something like even talk riem ann hypothesis might trouble proving havent expanded axiom mathematics level provable sentence like riem ann intriguing riem ann turns mathematical statement doesnt proof could prove doesnt proof weirdly would prove riem ann hypothesis must true go ah h riem ann hypothesis false mean theres zero line mean theres actually constructive way find set computer eventually finite process false find reason false false must provably false find riem ann actually undecidable proved axiom mathematics theres way false provable must true really weird way might prove riem ann hypothesis prove actually undecidable statement within axiom mathematics watching video thinking youve got even question incompleteness dont worry theres whole lot extra interview footage click links screen video description also video description find link professor u recent book whole bunch extra stuff incompleteness stuff science maybe cant know think know think still interesting explore thing might always transcend knowledge course religion give thing far many never think rather abstract idea unknown still quite intriguing one incompleteness theorem incompleteness theorem incompleteness
