marc us u quite incompleteness theorem many year kind place extraordinary limitation might able know mathematics fact quite un nerving theorem heart say might conjecture example something like gold bach conjecture might actually true might true every even number sum two maybe within axiomatic system mathematics n proof real worry true statement working away actually n proof big kind revelation mathematics think ever since ancient believe true statement mathematics proof might quite difficult find like last theorem took year colleague ox ford drew wile found proof think kind feeling like well surely every true statement proof show actually gap truth proof wrote quite cute one card statement side card false let suppose true mean statement side card false turn say statement side card true well meant false mean one side also false oh suppose true false side true mean get kind infinite loop verbal paradox es fine n expect every verbal sentence truth value went university realize mathematics ca n yet took course mathematical logic learned incompleteness theorem used kind self referential statement really undermine belief true statement could proved feeling like able prove mathematics something cal led consistent mathematics wo n give rise contradiction kind inspired certain kind little paradox es people like russel l come people might come across idea set set n contain member challenge well set set actually really nice kind version another sort mathematical kind verbal paradox defined less word example taxicab number hardy tal ked define less word number sum two two different ways less word define following number number defined less word think count add defined number less word go well bit worrying surely sort kind number might define number certain property real feeling paradox es set theoretic paradox es beginning real challenge mathematics turn century avid one big problem challenge mathematics century big unsolved problem second one prove mathematics fact consistent included every true statement provable shock got actually year later along comes logician blow idea prove math consistent water show true statement ca n proved within mathematical system mathematics work set thing cal led axiom kind thing believe way geometry works example take six add seven n think going different taking seven six seem blindingly obvious one axiom way work maybe somewhere goes wrong n really care interested mathematics true rule allow make deduction axiom mathematics works time make logical deduction expand conclusion axiom add new axiom feel like know n actually capture whole mathematics somehow mission want set axiom strong enough believe basic deduce statement proof feeling like well yeah well maybe n got axiom got true statement ca n proved could add new axiom expand prove within mathematics important trying prove set axiom deduce truth mathematics something clever coo ked way mathematics talk produced thing cal led cod ing sho wed statement particular code number fact use prime order make cod ing every statement mathematics could turned number example axiom mathematics trying make deduction would code true statement mathematics example last theorem example code number also false statement like even number code number k code look like obviously absolutely huge unique cod ing every code number worked backwards statement every number meaningful mathematical statement interesting way every mathematical statement unique number associated bit like thing computer good away write name change ascii code number associated coo ked useful actually talk proof mathematics start talk mathematics mathematics example might want know well particular statement provable axiom going completely simplify give feel essentially bit like saying statement whose code number divisible code number axiom provable axiom incredible simplification good mean talk proof within mathematically say something provable say example code number must divisible axiom challenge following statement statement proved axiom system mathematics actually something code number talk proof statement change mathematical equation mean equation mathematics either true false let start saying statement false mean statement provable axiom true provable statement must true star ted something assumed false deduce true got contradiction assuming mathematics consistent ca n contradiction important mean ca n false mean must true mathematical statement either true false like linguistic paradox es n truth value equation mathematics either true false shown false lead contradiction mean statement must true ah great got true statement let reinterpret say say statement proved axiom got true statement proved true axiom mathematics exactly wan ted got statement mathematics true proved go hold actually prove true proved true important articulate done within system mathematics certain axiom found true statement within ca n proved true within system proved true working outside system looking add axiom true statement wo n make something consistent inconsistent could add axiom say well got proof axiom one kind infinite regress es say going help still cook within new system another statement true unprovable sort infinite regress thing say matter much expand mathematics axiom always missing something little bit like remember proof infinitely many say suppose finitely many prove missing list say well add keep trick well still good enough still thing missing similar kind feel might try expand mathematics add axiom wo n help keep game like though problem restricted little self referential corner like n feel like put gold bach reach thing reach one little game play mathematician hope weird logical sentence really n really much mathematical content think people hoped thing like gold bach would one hope really blown away mathematician came statement think kind like gold bach nature think well yeah something want able prove true sho wed sentence true provable within quite standard system mathematics discovered ca n hope weird self referential sentence going could gold bach could gold bach twin might also something like even talk riem ann hypothesis might trouble proving n expanded axiom mathematics level provable sentence like riem ann intriguing riem ann turns mathematical statement n proof could prove n proof weirdly would prove riem ann hypothesis must true go ah h riem ann hypothesis false mean zero line mean actually constructive way find set computer eventually finite process false find reason false false must provably false find riem ann actually undecidable proved axiom mathematics way false provable must true really weird way might prove riem ann hypothesis prove actually undecidable statement within axiom mathematics watching video thinking got even question incompleteness n worry whole lot extra interview footage click links screen video description also video description find link professor u recent book whole bunch extra stuff incompleteness stuff science maybe ca n know think know think still interesting explore thing might always transcend knowledge course religion give thing far many never think rather abstract idea unknown still quite intriguing one incompleteness theorem incompleteness theorem incompleteness theorem incompleteness theorem incompleteness theorem
