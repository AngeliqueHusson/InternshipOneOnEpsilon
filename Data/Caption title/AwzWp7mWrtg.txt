video want talk derive formula annually maybe well use specific get going well try generalize going continue last example suppose walk bank deposit ten thousand dollar whats scalled principle principle denote capital p suppose get rate whatever denote rate well denote let maybe put red rate well call well label annual percentage rate notice suppose get p r case want calculate much money would annually key thing recognize formula take starting principle take starting principle multiply one plus whatever decimal thats gon na give amount total amount end thats going one key thing case end year one end year one starting principle ten thousand multiply one plus decimal would point zero six say need multiply ten thousand one point zero six got number video sho wed ten thousand six hundred end year end year one notice would starting principal number one point zero six whatever equal going multiply think help us spot pattern mean end year two much money would well weve got money total amount money end year one one well year one got ten thousand times one point zero six dollar well amount end year one didnt multiply get new amount would multiply remember rewrite got one point zero six times one point zero six simply rewrite compactly ten thousand times one point zero six power likewise end year three whats gon na happen gon na amount previous year ten thousand one point zero six squared thats balance end year two would get balance end year three well since compounding annually would multiply value yet another one point zero six well multiply another one point zero six gon na starting principal times one point zero six time raised third power think maybe probably guess would happen next one end year four would get ten thousand times one point zero six fourth power end year five would turn fifth power end six would sixth power maybe kind extrapolate nice formula would leave one kind look like amount accumulate thats stand accumulate amount l z q mutilate think one l better gon na get amount accumulate amount accumulate look like weve always got starting principal multiplying number one point zero six well point zero six took one plus added decimal look like want know amount accumulate year tome look like remember said three year gon na three exponent four look like total year would would put let meuse capital say formula would year interest annually rate p r thats denote rate weve got nice little derivation compound interest formula works compounding interest annually still good little formula hope sense want talk next video happen interest annually know year twice year three times year year monthly maybe daily stop maybe doit every minute every second every millisecond compound often want thing going change little bit definitely want talk question feel free hopefully somebody else help hope help de riving annual compound interest formula de riving annual compound interest formula de riving annual compound interest formula de riving annual compound interest formula de riving annual compound interest formula de riving annual compound interest formula de riving annual compound interest formula de riving annual compound interest formula de riving annual compound interest formula de riving annual compound interest formula de riving annual compound interest formula de riving annual compound interest formula de riving annual compound interest formula de riving annual compound interest formula de riving annual compound interest formula de riving annual compound interest formula de riving annual compound interest formula de riving annual compound interest formula de riving annual compound interest formula
