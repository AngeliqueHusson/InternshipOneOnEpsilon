voice let say got triangle side length b equal whatever measurement u singlet say side right side right length c happen equal nine want figure length side side length need figure going equal wo n able figure unless also know angle could bring blue side green side close together would small angle would need know angle well let say know angle call theta equal figure encourage pause try well lucky us law cosine give us way deter mining third side know two sides angle law cosine tell us squared going equal b squared plus c squared dealing pure right triangle degree would hypotenuse would done would theorem law cosine give us adjustment theorem arbitrary angle law cosine tell us squared going b squared plus c squared minus two times b c times cosine theta theta angle open side care use theta looking gave us another angle right angle would care angle open side going solve let solve know b c theta actually squared going equal b squared going equal plus c squared plus minus two times b times c minus two write minus two times times nine times cosine degree sand going equal let see minus let see times nine times two times cosine degree snow let get calculator order approximate remember squared actually get calculator let solve going square root going equal square root business copy paste going equal square root let copy paste going equal square root use calculator figure outlet increase radical little bit make sure taking square root whole thing let get calculator want find square root let make sure degree mode degree mode trig function degree fine let exit going minus times cosine degree snot degree degree sand deserve drum roll going say wan ted round nearest tenth get approximation would approximately approximately equal whatever long law cosine trig example trigonometry khan academy law cosine trig example trigonometry khan academy law cosine trig example trigonometry khan academy law cosine trig example trigonometry khan academy law cosine trig example trigonometry khan academy law cosine trig example trigonometry khan academy law cosine trig example trigonometry khan academy
