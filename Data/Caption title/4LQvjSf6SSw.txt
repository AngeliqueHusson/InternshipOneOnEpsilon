today gon na tell sequence appear set hopefully mind blown end sentence sequence rule take previous two number sand add together get next right star ted sum next number sum sum sum ill one continue easy easy right occur everywhere interesting connection thing nature want show appear set slightly less easy set special object inside complex plane plane complex way cook thing considering certain type dynamical system give complex number c picture complex plane real real square root minus one give complex number set take function z squared plus cand look happen zero plug function repeatedly number doesnt get large c set know sort complicated let example right look c equal minus one right look function z squared minus one plug number zero zero plug function give minus one minus one plug function give one minus one zero gon na repeat pattern number doesnt get large matter far go number set right complex number make decision based happen zero iteration look something like theres big piece middle interior included way little disc around minus one theres piece coming kind funny tendril stuff goes piece way another heart shaped love thing even nonmathematician love thing maybe different right sequence mean first thing nothing whole addition arithmetic kind thing think weird see let show find didnt draw many theres bunch little component coming main cal led hyperbolic component let get component going assign number number going number branch es come sort tendril bit cal led antenna like component theres part tendril theres three different go antenna component number three similarly actually turns theres two go antenna component number two look next biggest one component two three component drawn havent drawn ill try turns theres exactly five direction go antenna next biggest two draw sure fit since think already know answer eight go set start two component two look next biggest component next biggest one next number want explain youd better right ill explain least part cal led big piece main component cal led main whats number number one actually thats really good question obvious see antenna soso main cardioid one turns theres natural way stretch thing back disk something understand really well right always useful sort geometry kind study change something little bit get back something understand really well theres natural way view thing stretch disk map stretch cardioid want look happen first center point turns goes zero ray map ray ray guess zero way around circle right go halfway around circle map line inside main cardioid go say third way around circle map kind funny curve inside main cardioid two third track happen ray stretch thing place ray end main cardioid exactly place connect connection two component connection top three component bottom three component five component set must five ray land fact turns thats two fifth way around circle ray point map number antennae number assigned component denominator fraction tell far around circle went question whats two totally separate question whats fraction denominator two five component two fifth one fifth three fifth two seem arbitrary one drew one third one half thats two five component totally right yep works every time point read two different ways right antenna fraction way around circle c losing said change question completely question whats fraction denominator two third less fraction less one half question want denominator fraction small well cant right small really two answer next one next one three right want number thats possible denominator check six seven arent gon na turns answer general crazy thing fraction close enough together way find one denominator taking mediant fairy sum people refer fresh men sum get together numerator together freshman sum well think mean actually mean maybe kindergarten sum people dont know math would think legitimate thats right thats well legitimate legitimate thing tell bad right bad way add fraction matter represent try add way get something different add right good works works right symbol usually used mediant mediant two fraction sis mediant two fraction look fraction star ted star ted first two element sequence third fourth element sequence way get next thing two together exactly rule define sequence coming mediant sand coming set youd like better understand set mean really understand check look set quiz set quiz well weve covered set theyre brilliant problem web site let go world math science watching stuff stuff theres lot like curate like guide step step help understand work making feel silly mean look look hint help along way also help understand beautiful mathematics really made impression really feel like people know theyre made good thing check outgo
