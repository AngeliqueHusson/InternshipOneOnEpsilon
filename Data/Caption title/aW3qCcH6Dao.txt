hi I am Joe this lesson will cover anintroduction to number systems and howto convert between decimal binary andhexadecimal number systems what is anumber system let 's take a close look atthe number 25 let 's say for example 25is actually 2 times 10 plus 5 times 1 soin the ones digit we have a 5 and in thetens digit we have a 2 the ones digit isactually 10 to the 0 10 to the 0 poweris 1 and the tens digit is 10 to thefirst power 10 to the first power is 10now some of the other powers of 10 thethird digit from the right would be thehundreds digit the fourth digit from theright would be the thousands digit 10 tothe third power etc so it 's basicallyhow a number system works this is thedecimal number system which is alsocalled base 10 so 25 can be expressed as2 times 10 plus 5 times 1 or 2 times 10to the first power plus 5 times 10 tothe 0 power now what if a number systemonly used two different values 0 or 1this would be a base 2 number systembase 2 is also called binary you wouldhave to count like this starting with 01 there are only two digits keep in mindso as soon as you get to 1 you have toroll back the first digit to 0 you needto count the second digit 2 1 1 1 whatwould come next 101 0 0and then 1 0 1 followed by 1 1 0 and 1 11 so we 've just counted from 0 to 7using binary digits let me fill in theleading zeros for some of the firstnumbers now another way to look at thisas you count from 0 to 7 the firstrightmost digit least significant bitthis is called changes from 0 to 1 to 0to 1 to 0 to 1 0 to 1 the middle digitchanges from 0 to 0 to 1 to 1 0 0 1 1and the leftmost digit as 0 0 0 0 1 1 11 now the rightmost digit is the onesdigit which is represents 2 to the power0 the middle digit is the twos digitwhich is 2 to the power 1 and 2 squaredor 2 to the power 2 is the 4s digit nowsince there 's only two values thesedigits can each have 0 or 1there can be 1 4 1 2 & 1 1 so 0 or 1 nowin this case we have a number 1 0 1let 's try and convert this binary number1 0 1 to decimal so 1 0 1 is equal to 1times 2 to the second power plus 0 times2 to the first power plus 1 times 2 tothe 0 power and to simplify this 1 4 + 11 which makes 5 so that 's pretty simple1:01 binary is equal to 5 in decimal nowlet 's convert a bigger number let 's lookat an eight digit binary number andconvert that to decimal we 're going tostart with a little table that has allthe powers of two from two to the zeroall the way through two to the sevenwe 'll calculate those powers it 's prettysimple because it just doubles you startas one on the rightmost digit and itdoubles each time you move one digit tothe left so 1 2 4 8 16 and so on belowthat we 're going to put our number nowbasically what our number means is 1times 128 plus 0 times 64 plus 1 times32 plus 0 times 16 and so on but maybean easier way to look at this we canlook at each bit the weight of the bitis 128 for the first bit to the left andwe can look at whether or not that bitis checked or whether or not it has a 1under it okay so the 128 bit is checkedso we 're going to add a 128 to our total64 bit is not checked so we do nothingthe 32 bit is checked so we add 32 toour total 16 and the 8 bits are notchecked so we skipped those the 4 bit ischecked so we add 4 to our total thetwos bit is checked we have 2 to ourtotal and the 1 bit is not checked so ifthese 8 digits four of them are checkedthe 128 and 32 the 4 and the 2 we simplyadd those four numbers to get 166 that'sour decimal equivalent now let 's tryanother conversion let 's convert asimilar to binary going the otherdirection is time so we 're going toconvert 75 decimal number 75 to binaryso we 're going to start with the sametable however we 're going to approachthis problem differently because we'reconverting another direction so first wehave to compare 75 to 128 well75 is less than 128 so we 're not goingto check the 128 digit we 're going toput a 0 there and then we 'll compare 75to 64 75 is greater than 64 so we canput a 1 there and then we 're going tosubtract 64 from 75 now we have 11decimal 11 decimal units left todistribute across the the binaryconversion from 32 down so we 'll compare11 to 32 11 is less than 32 so we'regoing to put a 0 there and move on 11 isless than 16 so we 'll put a 0 under 16and we 'll move on 11 is greater than 8so we 're going to put a 1 under the 8subtract 8 from 11 to get 3 and we'llmove to the 4-bit 3 is less than 4 sowe 'll place a 0 there 3 is greater than2 so we 'll put a 1 under the twos digitwe 're going to subtract 2 from 3 we get1 and we 'll place the 1 in the onesdigit after that we have 0 left so we'redone with our conversion we 've converted75 decimal to 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 binarynow let 's look at a base 16 numbersystem also called hexadecimal now thebase 16 number system has 16 differentcharacters to represent the numbers 0through 15 so there are a totalof 16 possible values that each digitcan have and as you move one digit tothe left it increases by a factor of 16each time so in this case though there'sa ones digit a 16s digit whichrepresents 16 to the power one in the256 is digit which represents 16 to thepower 2 and so on now the hexadecimalnumber system uses the same digits asthe decimal number system for 0 through9 8 and 8 are the same 9 and 9 are thesame but for 10 hexadecimal uses an A torepresent 10 it uses a B to represent 11and so on through F for 15 so this tableis a summary that shows the decimalnumbers from 0 to 15 hexadecimal numbersfrom 0 through F which is equivalent to0 through 15 and in decimal and binarynumbers from 0 0 0 0 through 1 1 1 1which is equivalent to 0 through 15 nowyou 'll notice that the hexadecimalnumber is exactly equal to 4 binarydigits because all four binary digitsare set when we reach 15 so this makesit very easy and convenient to changebetween hexadecimal and binary digitsnow let 's let 's try converting a hexnumber to binarylet 's convert hexadecimal a 7 to binaryand by the way the notation I 've usedhere 0x a 7 is commonly used to indicatea hexadecimal number by putting a 0xbefore the numberso first what we 're going to do is lookup the a on our table well the a isequivalent to 1 0 1 0 in binary nowwe 're going to look up the 7 on the sametable the 7 is equivalent to 0 1 1 1 inbinary now if we did n't want to lookthose up in the table we could I 'll showyou a shortcut in a second but 0 X a 7is equal to 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 1binary so this was a pretty simpleconversion using the table it only tooka matter of seconds now you could seethat in the 1 0 1 0 the 8 digit is setand the twos digit is set so 8 plus 2 isequal to 10 in decimal and 10 is equalto a because it 's the first digit above9 and the 7 has the 4s digit the twosdigit and the ones digits all set so 0 11 1 is equal to 7 decimal so let 's tryconverting a hexadecimal number to adecimal number we 're going to converthexadecimal a 7 to decimal now of coursewe already established that a is equalto 10 so hexadecimal a 7 is equal to 10times 16 because a is in the 16s placeplus 7 times 1 because the 7 is in theones digit so we add these together andhere we go 1 67 decimalso hexadecimal a 7 is equal to 167 indecimal so that one 's pretty simplelet 's try a bigger number 697 in decimaland we 're going to convert that to hexso this time we 're going a differentdirection and we have a differentapproach here so 697 we have to start bydividing it by 16 and we get 43remainder 9 now we 're going to divide 43by 16 and we get 2 remainder 11 nowwe 're going to divide 2 by 16 and we get0 remainder 2 so 11 is equivalent to Bas we know from our table beforeso our hexadecimal equivalent of 697 indecimal is to be 9 now it 's importantthat you copy the digits down in theright order the least significant bit isthis 9 which was the first remainderthat we got when we do our division thesecond bit was the B was the remainderwe got from the second division and the2 was the last remainder which is themost significant or left most bitokay so 697 decimal works out tohexadecimal to be 9 now a final note onnumber system notation commonly numbersare denoted by using a small subscriptto indicate the base that the number isin so in base 10or decimal I 've shown an example here 54base 10 a small subscripted 10 to denotethat the 54 is in base 10 now normallywhen you see numbers written with nosubscript the natural assumption is thatit 's a decimal number that 's the defaultin most cases unless you see a stringsof spring of ones and zeros in whichcase you can almost always conclude thisbinary depending on what context you'reworking in but one zero one one with asubscript two indicates that by neri andthen any hexadecimal number with asubscript at 16 is hexadecimal orsometimes hexadecimal numbers often usethe notation that we use throughout thispresentation 0x preceding number now wedid n't use the subscripts in thispresentation because the subscripts tendto be a little hard to read in YouTubevideos of its we thank you very much forjoining us we hope you learned somethingfrom this lessonyou test
