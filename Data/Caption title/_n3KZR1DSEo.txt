hi welcome math antic sin last geometry video learned important thing thing learned angle come different sizes big small well video gon na learn tell exactly big small angle gon na learn angle measured probably already know lot measurement like know measure long something ruler tape measure use would inch es centimeter something like right comes angle ca n use ruler measure use like centimeter sand angle arent length angle rotation measure much something rotated use special unit cal led degree snow hold second thought degree used measure hot cold something ya know like degree outside today ah good point smart looking fellow word degree actually used fora lot different thing little make sense think degree small amount something temperature degree small amount heat angle degree small amount rotation special math symbol use instead writing word degree little circle put number near top see use degree measure angle let get two ray point exactly direction let put one ray directly top one one ray even though really two let take ray top rotate tiny amount counterclockwise point ray axis center rotation like point center clock stays stationary hand rotate around ray form angle measure degree see degree really small angle need zoom see really angle fact might wonder could angle smaller degree yep sure saw one second ago rotated top ray ray exactly top zero degree angle whole range tiny fraction angle degree n going learn video instead going keep rotating top ray watch angle get bigger bigger special tell us many degree angle measure snow let start slow degree let hold second degree look degree huh guess smart thought see degree angle still small angle let keep going little bit faster time degree degree special angle exactly half right angle draw right angle spot see ray cut two equal half right angle guess many degree right angle let keep rotating see right right angle exactly degree super important memorize right angle used time remember last video angle less right angle cal led acute angle mean angle seen far degree like acute keep rotating ray past degree start forming obtuse angle greater right angle ready go degree ha look familiar yep straight angle like learned last video ray point exactly opposite direction sand angle form degree also really important angle measurement memorize go let quickly review important angle region loo ked angle measurement zero degree ray point direction degree perpendicular form right angle degree point opposite direction form straight angle region find obtuse angle sand region find acute important acute angle degree since half right angle alright let continue rotating past degree sour angle keep getting higher next important angle come one degree sit also form right angle point instead let keep going another really important angle around corner coming right rotated ray way around axis back might wondering back star ted counter reading degree instead degree like answer even though ray back place rotate top ray degree get see angle arc form complete circle degree angle represent full circle rotating degree way around circle point star ted know degree seen relate size angle need learn actually measure angle without fancy like ruler used measure length line special tool cal led protractor used measure angle sa protractor similar ruler curved half circle measure rotation around axis point protractor also straight edge hole middle represent axis center rotation given mystery angle like one want measure many degree put protractor top axis point intersection ray like make sure one ray straight line protractor last look see ray curved read angle measurement see angle one thing want teach video probably see kind geometry problem homework remember complementary supplementary angle last video complementary angle combine form right angle supplementary angle combine form straight angle well know right angle degree straight angle degree use information solve problem unknown angle like one show two angle b combine form right angle problem tell us angle degree want us figure angle b fortunately easy figure know right angle degree know total angle must mean find angle b take total degree subtract angle degree whatever left angle b angle b degree snow let try problem idea straight angle time straight angle divided two smaller angle angle angle b problem tell us angle degree want us figure angle b know total angle must learned big straight angle take total degree subtract angle degree whatever left subtract ing must angle b cool huh see important know degree work geometry tell us big angle much something got video n worry lot geometry came get going next video get going practic ing learned thanks watching math antic see ya next time learn math antic angle
