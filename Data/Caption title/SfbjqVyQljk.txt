We 're asked to add the complex number 5 plus 2ito the other complex number 3 minus 7i.And as we 'll see , when we're adding complex numbers , you can only add the real parts to each otherand you can only add the imaginary parts to each other.So let 's add the real parts.So we have a 5 plus a 3.And then the imaginary parts -- we have a 2i.So plus 2i.And then we have a negative 7i , or we 're subtracting 7i.So minus 7i right over here.And 5 plus 3 -- that's pretty straightforward.That 's just going to be 8.And then if I have two of somethingand from that I subtract seven of that something -- and in this case , the something isthe imaginary unit , the number i.If I have two i 's and I take away seven i 's , then I havenegative five i's.2 minus 7 is negative 5.So then I have negative 5i.So when you add these two complex numbers , you get 8 minus 5i.You get another complex number.It has a real part and an imaginary part .
