n like beautiful blend simplicity complexity often infinitely particular tend often take sa shockingly small amount code produce image way intricate human hand ever could hope draw lot people know definition least one father geometry mind common misconception example snowflake looking shape right cal led snowflake consist three different segment one perfectly self similar zoom get perfectly identical copy original likewise famous triangle three smaller identical n get wrong definitely beautiful good toy model really much conception mind beauty pragmatic desire model nature away actually capture roughness ways geometry rebellion calculus whose central assumption thing tend look smooth zoom far enough saw overly idealize least needlessly idealize resulting model neglect finer detail thing theyre actually modeling matter observe self similar basis modeling regularity form roughness popular perception include perfectly self similar another idealization one ironically goes pragmatic spirit geometry real definition idea dimension main topic video see sense certain way define word dimension triangle approximately v k och curve approximately coast line turns around general possible whose dimension positive real number think first reference fractional dimension like thought nonsense right mean mathematician clearly making stuff dimension something usually make sense natural right line plane two dimensional space live three dimensional fact linear algebra student learned formal definition dimension context would agree make sense counting number sand course idea made mean math everything made question whether turns useful construct modeling world think learn defined something start seeing almost everywhere look actually help start discussion looking perfectly self similar fact going start four first three n line square cube triangle line broken two smaller perfect copy original scaled half square broken four smaller perfect copy original scaled half likewise cube broken eight smaller one scaled version core characteristic triangle made three smaller length side one smaller one half side length original triangle fun compare measure would say smaller line one half length original line smaller square area original square small cube one eighth volume original cube triangle well talk measure moment want word generalize idea length area volume apply typically math word use measure think might intuitive talk mass imagine made metal thin wire flat sheet solid cube kind dimension everything understanding mass scale benefit starting discussion self similar us nice clear cut way scale line half mass also scaled viscerally see take two smaller one form whole scale square one half mass scaled one fourth see piecing together four smaller get original likewise cube one half mass scaled one eighth one half cube take eight smaller cube rebuild scale factor half would n agree make sense say mass goes factor one third mean three smaller form original notice line square cube factor mass change clean integer power one half fact exponent dimension shape could say mean shape example two dimensional put two two dimensional scale factor mass scaled factor raised power maybe mean shape tobe three dimensional scale factor mass scaled third power factor conception dimension dimensionality triangle want say scale factor one half mass goes half power well whatever dimension self similar know want mass godown factor one third whats number raising one half power give one third well quintessential type question logarithm meant answer go base two calculator find way triangle one dimensional even though could define curve point even though live plane instead want mass neither length area seem like fitting notion tried length would turn tobe infinite area would turn instead want whatever length let look another self similar curve one composed four smaller identical copy original scaled one third scaling factor one third mass factor mean dimension number raise one third power give us one fourth well saying equal four go plug calculator log base comes around sense curve shape another fun one kind right angled version built eight scaling factor one fourth want know dimension number one fourth power equal one eighth factor mass decrease dand case value want base exactly three halves evidently precisely dimensional kind make sense weird scaling scale far everything point might call good job making idea fractional dimension seem somewhat reasonable really general notion mean reasoning shape change lied self similarity could build restrictive consider disk interior circle know say scale factor mass proportional area get scaled square factor case four like way piece together smaller circle rebuild original know bigger disk exactly four times original answer ing way make idea massa little mathematically rigorous since dealing made matter dealing purely geometric one sliving abstract space couple ways think common one cover plane grid highlight grid square touching disk count many back mind already know disk two dimensional grid square proportional area clever way verify scale disk factor like two count many grid new version find number approximately proportion square scaling factor case mean four times many admittedly screen might look convincing grid really coarse instead took much finer grid one tightly capture intent going measuring size circle relationship number scale disk factor two shine admit though animating surprise slowly value converge one way think plot scaling number box es scaled disk touch es data closely fit perfect parabola since box es touched roughly proportional square scaling factor value actually equivalent looking finer grid data going perfectly fit parabola getting back let play game triangle counting many box es touching point shape would imagine compare scaling triangle factor counting new number box es touched well proportion box es touched big one number box es touched small one three bigger version built three smaller version could also think two raised dimension saw go plot scaling factor case box es touched triangle data would closely fit curve shape x proportionality constant importantly whole reason talking play game nonself similar shape still kind roughness classic example coast line plop coast line plane count many box es scale amount count many box es new scaled version find number coast line proportion scaling factor raised power kind fun think would actually compute number imagine give shape savvy programmer would find saying scale shape factor call number box es touching shape equal constant times scaling factor raised whatever dimension value looking data plot closely curve look like input raised power hard see exactly power common trick take logarithm sides way dimension going drop exponent nice clean linear relationship suggest sis plot log scaling factor log number box es touching relationship look like line line aslope equal dimension mean tried bunch scaling factor number box es touching coast instant plotted log log plot could kind linear regression find best fit line data set look slope line tell empirical measurement dimension examining think idea dimension much real visceral compare abstract artificially perfect comfortable thinking dimension like friend become ready definition essentially whose dimension integer instead cool quantitative way say rough stay rough even zoom technically slightly accurate definition included video description idea hereof non integer dimension almost entirely capture idea roughness going one nuance though n brought yet worth pointing dimension least describe box counting method sometimes change based example sitting three dimension distance look like line way box counting grid full little little square works way scale shape thickness smaller size box es look one dimensional meaning box es touch es proportional length scale start lot like tube touching box es surface tube two dimensional number touched proportional square scaling factor really tube made rapidly winding little curve scale even point box es pick curve number touched scaling directly proportion scaling constant actually assign ing number shape dimension tricky leaves room differ ing definition sand different convention pure math setting indeed dimension focus limit dimension closer closer think term plot limit slope move farther farther right purely geometric shape genuine continue looking rough even zoom infinitely far applied setting like looking coast line n really make sense limit zoom mean point hit ting atom instead look sufficiently wide range scales compute dimension one applied setting shape typically considered measured dimension stays approximately constant even across multiple different scales example coast line n look distance even zoom factor thousand level roughness still around right sense nature actually perfectly play important role infract al geometry give us phenomenon roughness roughness persist many different scales arbitrarily close scales important give primitive tool modeling phenomena think also important view prototypical example general actually lot character really think one learn start looking world completely differently number fractional dimension quantitative way describe roughness example coast line away communicate fact way jagged coast line surface calm ocean might barely two one might dimension closer fact dimension doesnt arise frequently nature core differentiator arise naturally final
