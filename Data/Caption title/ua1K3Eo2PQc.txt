actually super interesting one famous proof time proof last theorem drew wile famously n wan na explain want explain heart actually wile spent seven year actually something conjecture cal led gon na say last theorem true obvious fact one n equal two case theorem something cal led theorem n equal something else two thing elliptic curve specifically whole fraction actually modular form disguise mean feel even mathematician like want trying get appreciate mean appreciation full thing appreciation going gon na going use much simpler equation right want start starting modular form modular form way need think something symmetry different form symmetry one want show today cal led translational symmetry imagine infinite nicely provided brown imagine actually going kind put arrow represent chopped imagine cutting strip infinite strip important thing width something symmetry translational symmetry cos goes forever like left right imagine kind situation symmetry basically take strip cut paste important want know function cut paste cut paste yeah graph looking equation want something generate say like picture funny picture might really complicated equation maybe n even equation think pattern mean n even regular pattern shirt usually like pretty regular patterned point want show something actually regular pattern something seen one thing like basically sine wave goes actually long complicated equation important thing like even though equation crank potentially could cut paste cut paste cut paste idea modular form except hyperbolic geometry really complicated get appreciate fact cut paste thing take one section cut paste cut paste idea like function like attempt laughing si mon thanks manso circle equation actually going write equation fun basically circle another equation except n translational symmetry think exist one section relationship saying curve whole fraction modular form disguise actually saying fit modular form elliptic curve fit translational symmetry equation equation circle saying magical stuff work make work well way think imagine point circle alright start following around yeah let fun maybe could really quickly maybe go slowly maybe go chose constant rate going round round round imagine look like actually moving space think circle imagine go like gon na start moving rate going actually going actually making like slinky si mon like slinky right imagine right actually coil slinky make imagine got slinky perfectly evenly spaced equation helix equation got equation happen look barrel helix would see loo ked straight perspective problem like look straight barrel would see brad right actually going helix fit inside equation circle reason works space space flat dealing curvy space really option actual elliptic curve belong projective space modular form belong hyperbolic space complex mean really super curvy example really nice actually two dimensional exist three dimension got ta think different relationship going coil coil translational symmetry link modular form elliptic curve really strange function fit inside really dull function one believe one believe could stick know stick coil circle reason one could visualize nicely like completely different space connection happen actually make last theorem work real thing think whole number fraction cycling around k long fraction b point comeback top like point fraction number multiply fraction get whole number mean turning around circle start sort fraction end back spot irrational number definition something ca n fraction star ted point went around root two never get back actual original position feeling hereof proof fact matter type proof worked trying give feeling going fact reason last theorem involve way actually work together impact whether put curve one linked inhere fact said last theorem involve whole therefore circle equation making permit one thing except proved wonderful people seen seeing n seen yet wonderful people actually proved sho wed contradiction basically even though rule whole n permit one thing one equaling two thanks supporting video got hundred eighty thousand spoken word title collection often enjoy listening well daily dog walk herewith girl beauty mathematics something like n try love math hidden heart reality probably seen quite video already got great stuff quite lot last theorem something million professor frank el research like many book available audio form audible go like give try free one month trial might choose different book extensive collection plenty math assure know came happy audible user like thank
