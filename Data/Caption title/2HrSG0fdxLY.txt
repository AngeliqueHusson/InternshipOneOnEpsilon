last time left wondering imaginary could help us find root equation imaginary negative even came part modern mathematics voided ignore couple thousand year let honest dont really make much sense something eu rope around ago would longer allow mathematician ignore mathematician trying solve problem different point youve probably seen quadratic formula formula super useful give us root equation highest power plug b c pop answer trying find formula like equation highest power cubic general case pretty tough first considered case term missing last term negative century negative term way sketchy write wrote cubic require c positive equation set game get x one side constant side pretty easy linear equation add multiply divide subtract get x alone quadratics make bit harder may learned solve school require cleverness factor ing square trying thing cubic equation clever substitution eventually found solution like quadratic formula new formula find solution cubic equation simply plugging value reason way mathematician money century mathematician basically math duel kept new formula secret use next duel happen next bit long story quick version kept formula secret deathbed finally told student fi fi immediately thought invincible least invincible math duel challenge way skilled mathematician font ana duel already could solve cubic equation like actually totally fa king math actually figure solve equation last minute completely dominate fi went share formula world really kept super secret could keep kicking butt math duel talented mathematician name hear formula pressure share eventually went along swore oath secrecy fortunately us came across surviving work original discoverer figured wasnt big secret formula book ar mag na went improve bor rowed formula even making work cubic included term however along way came across problem slightly different version equation written certain value c formula would break let take innocent looking equation plug formula get result involve square root negative square root negative number enough problem stop track square root ask us find number yield number inside root sign square root times importantly square root also negative negative times negative also positive root negative square root negative positive wont work neither negative stuck stuck didnt know negative certainly wasnt first time square root negative shown usually mathematician would interpret problem way saying solution many case true however case know theres least one solution way cubic shaped regardless coefficient cubic function always cross x axis least meaning equation least one real solution problem must answer formula proven work put together try solve problem formula quickly arrive appear impossible square root negative sometimes thing break math science mean theyre broken interesting situation broken mathematics give us key unlock new insight way formula broken turned incredibly important mathematics science thats well discuss next time imaginary real part little history imaginary real part little history imaginary real part little history imaginary real part little history imaginary real part little history imaginary real part little history imaginary real part little history imaginary real part little history imaginary real part little history
