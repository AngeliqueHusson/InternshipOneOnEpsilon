Last time , we left off wondering how imaginary numbers could help us find the roots of our equation , x²+1 . And further how imaginary and negative numbers even became part of modern mathematics after being avoided and ignored for a couple thousand years . Because - let 's be honest here - they do n't really make that much sense . But something happened in Europe around 5 centuries ago that would no longer allow mathematicians to ignore these numbers . An Italian mathematician , Scipione del Ferro , was trying to solve a problem not that different from ours . At some point , you 've probably seen the quadratic formula . This formula is super useful because it gives us the roots of any equation with the highest power of 2 . All you have to do is plug in a , b and c and out pops the answer . Del Ferro was trying to find a formula like this for equations with the highest power of 3 ; cubics . The general case is pretty tough , so Del Ferro first considered the case where the x² term is missing and the last term is negative . In the 16th century , negative terms were way too sketchy to write , so Del Ferro wrote his cubic as x³+cx=d , and required c and d to be positive . Now that we have our equation set up , the game here is to get x by itself on one side and all the constants on the other side . This is a pretty easy in linear equations , we can just add , multiply , divide or subtract until we get x alone . Quadratics make this a bit harder . You may have learned how to solve these in school . It requires some cleverness and factoring by completing the square . Del Ferro was trying to do the same thing for his cubic equation . And through some clever substitution , he eventually found a solution . Just like the quadratic formula , Del Ferro 's new formula allowed him to find the solution to cubic equations by simply plugging in values . Now , for some reason , the way mathematicians earned money in the 16th century was through challenging other mathematicians to what were basically math duels . So Del Ferro kept his new formula a secret to use in his next duel . What happens next is a bit of a long story , here 's the quick version : Del Ferro kept his formula secret until he was on his deathbed , when he finally told his student Antonio Fior . Fior immediately thought he was invincible or at least invincible in a math duel and challenged a way more skilled mathematician , Fontana Tartaglia to a duel . Tartaglia had already claimed he could solve cubic equations like this , but actually he had been totally faking it . Tartaglia freaked out before the `` math-off '' and actually figure out how to solve these equations at the last minute and procedeed to completely dominate Fior . Tartaglia then went on to share his formula with the world ! Not really , he kept it super secret so he could keep kicking butt in math duels . That is until a very talented mathematician named Cardan heard about the formula and pressured Tartaglia to share . He eventually went along but only after Cardan swore to an oath of secrecy . Fortunately for us , after Cardan came across the surviving work of the original discoverer , Del Ferro , he figured that was n't such a big secret and published the formula in his book `` Ars Magna . '' Cardan went on to improve his borrowed formula , even making it work for cubics that included an x² term . However , along the way , Cardan came across a problem : in a slightly different version of the equation , written as x³=cx+d , under certain values of c and d , the formula would break . Let 's take the innocent-looking equation x³=15x+4 . When we plug into Cardan 's formula , we get a result that involves the square root of negative numbers . The square root of a negative number created enough of a problem to stop Cardan in his tracks . Square roots ask us to find a number , that when multiplied by itself , yield the number inside the root sign . The square root of 9 is 3 because 3 times 3 is 9 . Importantly , the square root of 9 is also negative 3 because negative 3 times negative 3 is also positive 9 . But what about the roots of negative numbers ? What is the square root of negative 9 ? Positive 3 wo n't work , and neither will negative 3 , so we 're stuck . Cardan was stuck too , he did n't know of any numbers that when multiplied by themselves resulted in a negative . Now , this certainly was n't the first time the square root of a negative had shown up . Usually , mathematicians would interpret this as the problem 's way of saying there are no solutions , and in many cases , this is true . However , in this case , we know there 's at least one solution because of the way cubics are shaped . Regardless of their coefficients , cubic functions will always cross the x-axis at least once , meaning that our equation x³=15x+4 will have at least one real solution . So what we have here is a problem that must have an answer , and the formula that has been proven to work . But when we put these together and try to solve the problem with our formula , we quickly arrive at what appears to be the impossible ; the square roots of negative numbers . Sometimes when things break in math and science , it means just that ; they 're broken . But there are other more interesting situations in which broken mathematics gives us the keys to unlock new insights . The way in which Cardan 's formula was broken turned out to be incredibly important to mathematics and science , and that 's what we 'll discuss next time .
