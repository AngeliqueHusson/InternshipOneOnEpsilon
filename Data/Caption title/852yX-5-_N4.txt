g'day welcome to tech my channel whatwe 're gon na be having a look at in thisvideo is how to measure angles and notonly that we can have a look at a fewother things actually we 're gon na lookat first off just the ways we measureangles then we 're gon na have a look atdifferent types of angles and theirmeasurements they have some commonangles all also then look at how toconstruct angles okay so I hope youenjoy this video hope it comes in handyfor youso the first off thing I 'll do is I'mjust gon na have a quick recap on what anangle is I made a previous video onangle so might be worth watching but ifyou ca n't be bothered you just wan na getstraight into it the first thing iswhere two lines meet so say we have twolines meeting here what we have is firstoff we have two arms meeting here thespot where they meet is called thevertex some of you guys might bethinking hey the previous video this iscalled any intersection where linesacross his cordon intersection it wasjust a point like this it 's called avertex but this little gap that we havehere this little space between the twoarms this is called an angle and we'regonna look at how we go about measuringthese because it 's fairly simple sofirst off the way that we measure anangle or any angle is using one of theseguys which is a tractor Napa tractor youmight actually have a different versionof one of these whether the full circlethey are they come in half circles orfour circles but for either one of themthey 're divided up into these littleparty you 'll say okay are these littleunits here 10 20 30 40 but even thesesmaller units here okay all up thisdivide up the 360 little parts and eachone of these little parts is called adegree so 360 degrees the symbol we usefor these is degrees like this so it'skind of like degrees that you might haveheard of when you are thinking oftemperature okay so it uses a similarsort of word it uses a similar sort ofsymbol but once measuring temperatureone is you know measuring the size of anangle so how do we use one of thesebetraying perpetrators well what I 'll dois the first up I 'll show you just somecommon angles that you 'll get with themokay so first off imagine that we hadtwo arms they 're meeting at the samepoint now this is gon na be the firstangle we 're looking at so what arm ispointing this way and the other herb isalso pointing in exactly the samedirection you might behave you measurethis you 're getting zero degrees andyou 'd be exactly right this is just a Iguess it 's no angle it 's zero degreesbut it 's a great little base to startfrom okay so we 're gon na start with thisidea of zero degrees and what is gonnamake our angles progressively biggerokay so so say we had one of our armsgoing off to zero degrees here and therewe had as you might remember from theprevious video going up through thisparticular party so we formed what isknown as a right angle I 'll write thatup here is a right angle again aprevious video we looked at these theyare symbolized by this you 'll noticethat these guys go up through that 90degrees this is a really reallyimportant angle to remember this is thereason it 's because this is the anglewhich accor occurs on the corners of saysquares and rectangles things like thisso an angle which goes up like thiswhich where the lines are coming oneperpendicular from the other is a rightangleokay so I 'll get rid of that and I'llnow talk about angles which occurbetween 0 degrees and right angle shemight remember these were called acuteangles and these were any angle whichoccurred between 90 degrees and SEROdegrees so I 'll give you an example thisI 'll get rid of I 'll just put this areup here on 90 so we can remember that'sa right angle but say we had an anglegoing up this way okay just selectingthe right pin there and say I had anangle which is going up yeah and youmight look at this and say hey this isgoing up about 61 62 degrees and this isan example of an acute angle it 's anangle which is between 0 and 90 degreesokay so an acute angle I 'll just putthat in there it 's between 0 and 90degrees okay so say we Bayour going further and further andfurther apart now and eventually theywent all the way around so we followthis baseline ride along on our tractoryou can see that we go all the wayaround to this measurement here which is180 degrees 180 degrees by the way thisan angle like this you might rememberfrom the earlier video I made is calleda straight angle you probably get theidea of why that 's called a straightangle being that it forms a straightline okayso straight angle is a hundred andeighty degrees another really importantone to remember okay so so far we 've gotzero degrees a right angle is 90 degreesa straight angle is 180 degrees and anyangles between 0 and 90 which are calledacute angles there 's another group ofangles which are any angles betweentheir right angle and their straightangle that 's where this 90 and 180between 90 degrees and 180 degrees andyou might remember these were calledobtuse angles okay so to saying alsoangles which occur between 90 and 180degrees so we can keep going all the wayaround because we 're not completelyfinished yet we can keep going around inthis circle because our angle couldextend even beyond this so starts to getrid of this line I 'll put this little R180 here so we remember that 's there butI could keep going here and I 'm justgonna zoom out a little bit so we cansee this so say I keep going and I startto measure say an angle which occursthis speak okay so what I 'm talkingabout here is an angle say this peak ifthis is the case we 're going beyond justthere any of these angles and we hitthis Zone in here which anywhere withinthis zone anywhere right around all theway back to 360 degreeswhich is called a reflex so any anglewhich is 180 degrees to 360 degrees iscalled a reflex angle okay now just onelittle thing with this you might alsorealize that you could come down at 270degrees another important one torememberand although the angle we 're talkingabout is going around here we do form alittle ninety degree on the outer partof angle there so that 's another goodone to remember there so say you mightactually consider say why do we botherhave 360 degrees when we go all the wayaround and the zero degrees the same as360 degrees the answer to that is nookay our zero degrees is where we haveno angle 360 degrees is where what we dois our angle at two arms meet but we'reactually talking about okay so here twoarms going this way but their anglewe 're talking about is this part herethe complete rotation okay rather thanthis nothing space in between okay sothere are different types of angles on acircle okayreally really important to rememberespecially the right angle here and thestraight angle here I think and thatknowing there 's 360 degrees in a circleI think they 're probably the mostimportant things so how do we go aboutmeasuring the angles in a circle okaythat 's the other next part of what we'lllook at you 've probably got this ideaalready we 're gon na well what you do isyou get your angle not actually justgonna superimpose an angle on top I'malso back in there and I 'm gonnasuperimpose an angle on top of whatwe 're doing because look at theprogramming you 're have does n't actuallywork very well to actually move by thetractor around so say here I 'm going todraw this angle a little bit other drawan easy one to start off if they get youto try knowing what it is so say thiswas my angle here you 're gon na noticefirst off what you do is you put thevertex of your angle on this centerpoint here and you have the horizontalcoming off on a zero so one of thebaselines of your angle coming off at azero but say I have an angle here whichis just there what is itsee you back around okay10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 decreased youmight be able to even go that next stepsay that 's an acute angle and you 'd beright it 's a fairly cute little angelokay are terrible baths joke okay you'dbe right but just what you 're doingthese you have to make sure that you'relining up your vert vertex with you seta point here of your tractor and alsothe base line here lines up the otherswant to show you what I 'm a littlepitiful that you can get in with yourmeasuring angles which is this one sayI 'm measuring this particular angle yeahokay I 've got my vert vertex hereeverything is good in the world I'vemeasured it up I 've kept it on zerobecause there 's a little zero down thereand I 'm going to measure this angle theyou might say okay what angle are wetalking about here so you might look atthis automatically and say hey that 's ahundred and thirty degrees I hate tobreak it to you you 're not correcthere 's what we have here is where I'mtalking about this particular littleankle here so you know look at this andsay hey wait a second this angle is lessthan 9 degrees it 's acute angle so it'sa really really important thing beforeyou measure any angle I think is toactually try to make a bit of a guessabout how big it is okay and if you'rehaving a look at this you might actuallynotice that this is we 're going up 10 2030 40 50 degrees okay so start from thezero which is he ca n't see it across thedoubt being a mean-spirited person onhim but this is how the a 50 degreeangle make sure you 're reading the rightone okay we 're not reading this part outhere we 're reading this particularsection here okay all right ah just flysee you probably do get the idea of howto construct an angle so say we wantedto construct an angle that was whatabout we want to construct an angle thatis 130 degrees B so usually what I dowith this is you 're not going to beunder necessarily drawn up attractorlike I can but what I do is I would sostart with my own vertices and I woulddraw the baseline okay just one baselinegoing that way but I 'd probably do abetter job of it then my messy thingthere and then what you could do youyou can move this app attractor so whatwe do is we 're going to move thisprotracted if this attractor wants tomove and have this real problem with abetrayer wo n't want to move so weactually oh look it 's definitely notgonna move there you do that was gonnahappen did you pretend we ca n't move itso what we 're going to eventually do wedo n't we 'll move it so good at shadinghere is there so we 'd move it so theseguys line up okay on the zero and saywhat we 're trying to draw a hundred andthirty degrees i down mark this area ini 'd get rid of my practice and pretendwe got rid of that Petrak sure alltogether and now i would draw this linehere the next thing I do is I make sureI labeled by angle okay even if i marketlike this i might even go that next stepof writing 130 degrees okay so anyway ihope you found that video informative weare going to do some more videos ourvideos so hopefully you have a look atthose this is just a nice basic thing tostart off with practice drawing anglesthey 're really really handy littlethings anyway see you next time bye Measuring angles - Degrees and Protractors Measuring angles - Degrees and Protractors Measuring angles - Degrees and Protractors
