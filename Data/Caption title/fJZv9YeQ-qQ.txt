what 's up everyone and welcome to thislesson on box and whisker plots now fromyour experiences as a math student I'msure that you 've come across differentmethods of visually representing datapie charts bar graphs and scatter plotsare a few examples of these tools ox andwhisker plots are another method ofvisualizing data to help us to makesense of it and that is what this lessonis going to focus on so again a box andwhisker plot is just a tool that 's goingto help us to analyze data so first weneed some data so let 's look at Jordan aJV basketball player who has just calledup to varsity for the last seven gamesof the season so Jordans using thischart to keep track of the number ofpoints he scores for each of these sevengamesnow we can use this performance data tocreate a box-and-whisker plot that willhelp us to evaluate Jordan 's performanceover this seven game span now our firststep is to take those numbers andrearrange them in order from least togreatest now the first piece ofinformation we can get from this data iswhat 's called the upper and lowerextremes this represents the highest andlowest value in the data set in thiscase the upper extreme is 32 and thelower extreme is 5 the next piece ofinformation that we need is the mediannow we know that the median is themiddle of the data set so I work fromthe outside and until I get to themiddle value in this case 17 is themedian and the final piece ofinformation that I need is what 's calledthe upper and lower quartilesnow we can think of this as splittingthe data set at the median into an upperand lower regions now the upper quartileis just the median of that upper regionof three numbers which we know is 20 andthe lower quartile is the median of thatlower region of those three numberswhich we know is ten so we can say thatthe upper quartile is 20 and the lowerquartile is 10 and now we have all theinformation that we need to constructour box and whisker plot so we 're goingto start with a number line that fitsour dataand we have to mark where our upper andlower extremes are five and thirty-twoas well as our median value at 17 andthe values of the upper and lowerquartiles in this example at 10 and 20now imagine taking these points andelevating them above the number line ourfirst step is to construct two verticallines through the upper and lowerquartiles and use these lines toconstruct a rectangular box thatencloses the median point and throughthat median point we construct avertical line this represents the box inour box and whisker plot and the finalstep is to draw horizontal lines thatconnect the upper quartile to the upperextreme and the lower quartile to thelower extreme and notice that the graphitself is broken up into four differentquadrants each representing 25 % of thehole now what you 're probably thinkingis how can we use this graph to evaluateJordans basketball performance now forexample by looking at the extremes wecould see that it 's probably unrealisticto expect Jordan in an average game toscore anything near his high of 32points or his low of 5 points now basedon those extremes you may think thatJordan is an inconsistent player but ifwe look at the area inside the box thisis called the interquartile range we cansay that in an average game Jordan willscore between 10 and 20 points and acoach can use this information todetermine whether or notJordan belongs in the starting lineup oron the bench come onhe can also use the box and whisker plotto compare Jordans performance with theperformance of other playersyouso let 's extend this understanding to areal-world example we 're going to joinJess who owns her own coffee shop andjust keeping data on the number ofExpress laws that she makes per dayso remember that our first step is torearrange the values in order from leastto greatest and now we 're ready to getthe information that we need so firstwe 'll start with the extremes the upperextreme at 96 the lower extreme at 32now for the median again moving outsidein to find the middle value we have twonumbers 51 and 59 so we just have to addthem up and divide that sum by two so110 divided by two is equal to 55 whichis the median for this example nownotice that the median is in between 51and 59 so when I split my numbers up Ihave to kind of draw a line in betweenthose two values now to find the upperquartile I find the median of thoseupper values that 's 65 and to find thelower quartile I do the same thing forthe lower values in this case 44 so nowI have the information that I need and Ican construct my box and whisker plot soas always the first step is to constructthe number line that fits our dataso we 'll start with points that areupper and lower quartiles at 65 and 44and then we 'll construct a point for themedian at 55 and we 'll use these pointsto construct our boxso again vertical lines through thequartiles constructor rectangle and thendraw another vertical line through themedian then we 're going to plot pointsat the two extremes at 32 the lowerextreme 96 the upper extremejust construct your horizontal lines andthe box-and-whisker plot is complete andnow you 're
