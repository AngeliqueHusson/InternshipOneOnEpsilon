the largest known prime number has justbeen found remember that a number isprime if it is divisible by only one anditself there are 25 Prime 's less than100 and Euclid proved that these go onforever Prime 's are the multiplicativebuilding blocks of the integers and theyare crucial to code making and internetsecurity there are many classes ofprimes but we want to look at Mersenneprimes these are named after muhammaraSen a French priest who organized thescientific community in France and iscalled the father of acousticsMerson looked at numbers of the form 2to the N minus 1here I 've listed the first few Mersennenumbers and you 'll notice that some ofthem are primenote that m n is prime only when nitself is a prime this is no coincidenceif n can be factored as a times B then 2to the N minus 1 can also be factored soit is not a prime for example M 6 is 63but since 6 is 2 times 3 we can factor63 like this this means that if MN isprime and itself is a prime does it workthe other way aroundnot necessarily 11 is a prime but M 11has factors 23 and 89 while testing theprime allottee of a large number usuallyrequires a ridiculous amount ofcomputation testing Mersenne numbers ismuch easierthe Lukas lamer tests named afterEdouard Lucca and D H lamer is tailoredto test Mersenne numbers first start byconstructing a special sequence ofnumbers start with the number for eachnumbers formed by squaring the previousnumber then subtracting 2 as you can seethese numbers grow pretty quicklythe Lucas lamer test says that MN isprime if and only if the n minus firstnumber in the sequence is divisible byMN let 's do an example with N equals 7note that M 7 is 127 the first step inthe sequence is 4 step 2 is 14 step 3 is194 since in the end we only care aboutwhether we have a multiple of 127 we candivide by 127 at each step and replaceour number with the remainder that iscalled modular arithmetic so we replace194 with the remainder when we divide by127 in this case 67 step 4 produces 4for 87 whose remainder is 42 step 5 is1762 whose remainder is 111 and finallystep 6 is 12 319 whose remainder is 0since the 6th step 7 minus 1 produces 0the Lukas lamer test tells us that M 7or 127 is a prime numberthe Lukas lamer test is the basis of ahuge effort to find Mersenne Prime'scalled the great internet Mersenne primesearch or giimpse for shortover 1 million CPUs have been used inthis project the new prime record has Nequals 74 million two hundred and seventhousand two hundred and eighty-onemeaning that this colossal number isprime this Mersenne prime has over 22million digits it was found by CurtisCooper an American math professorworking with the gimps project aquestion that still bafflesmathematicians is whether there areinfinitely many Mersenne primesis there even a next one beyond the onerecently found Largest Known Prime Discovered!
