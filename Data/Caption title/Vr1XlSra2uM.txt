okay morning everyone today we are goingto be filming the lesson onprobabilities we would yell but there'sa PSAT class behind us so as loud as youcan whisper this paradoxical so previouslessonslook we do n't we do n't need to we needto whisper the lesson just the screamingso I will speak normally formally I wentto the Roman numeral right what am itoday play some golfI bet jack hit the Colosseumprogram horse I 'm down to the patriarchyas we sit on our reconcile so we have ithere in the back go ahead yes yes youright you see this word you 're addingthe probabilities so addingprobabilities very good so now let'stalk about this one 's easy example was Ishy away from more easy but it 's morestraightforward the probability rollingin a three or an odd number so let 's howdo you suggest we do it right there 's acouple ways yes well the way I did it Idid a one six for the three okay that'sthe probability for that that 's theprobability 83 and then I do n't know ifI did this right I 'm going off of what Iremember from last year 's but um if it'sif it 's something neutrally mutuallyendeavor when it 's like we already havea three accounted for so we 're not goingto count because 3 is an odd number soit 's 135 so we 're not gon na count 3again yeahso you do two out of six right so let'sdo it formally and then we 'll get backto what you said okay so one six threedegrees the probability rolling at 3then we say add if we canany bleeding blue the pen is blue readyto see why liarroyal blue yeah this is the probabilitygame at three and then we say okay ofall the odd numbers laying them out forme and sings I have one three threefives there 's three of those but thenthe problem is here we counted a threeand here we come to three so thatthere 's an overlap with the data so thisis becoming three axis so this is allsort of mutually exclusive anyone knowmutually exclusive means have you heardit in your life saying I like thesethings are mutually exclusive rightyou 've heard of it have you not heard ofthey do n't know I can probably guessthis mutually to get the X coos so whatdo you thinkyeah now you can use it with them toevents they 're like or more so whenthere 's similar quick getting there okayfair enoughyes of two events that can not occursimultaneously chance okay now we knownow we 're gon na blend it with yourdefinition okay which ca n't occursimultaneously so let 's give us examplesof events that are mutually exclusivecourse ideas are things and occurrencesin life they 're mutually exclusive yeahsure that 's I 'm using some time give youone maybe Super Bowl champion do youagree that there 's only one Super Bowlchampion at a time right so the secondthat there 's a new Super Bowl championthe old one does not exist as championanymorepresidency of the United States mutuallyexclusive there 's one and if there isnot that person then there is the nextperson if it 's not that person it 's thenext personso what else in life is mutuallyexclusive eight o'clock and 9 o'clockthere you gounless we 're talking about nine o'clockin the next time zone then it would benot reach placebut right now where we 're standing it's12:15 12:15 is really exclusive from1:15 and so forth okay so that 's thatcan occur at the same time so update thedefinition of war so you addedprobabilities thank you probabilitiesbut then subtract overlap because youdo n't want to add that twice okay solet 's do this probability enjoying aface card or a red card okay so it getsa little more complicated let 's do thisone at a time so how many face cards arethere remind me 52 which is 4/3 not 16that with seven to twelve twelve so 1282right it was just the face parts nowlet 's add all the red part three sixyeah so do you agree that the red goodjob I 'm gon na subtract doctor so you'redoing it actually intuitively you'resaying I already have red ones in hereso you 're right you 're right I 'm justgonna show the real Oh make that processreally obvious and it 'll be in line withwhat you 're sayingthey 'll be in line so about it I 'll askyou right now then did you know how manyof these are ready there 's four jacksright to a read for Queens to a readyeah good job good jobso that 's why I go through this processreally like super obviously slowbeg pardon the whole deck 20:26 so thenyou would subtract 36 swagbecause swain here we had six red cartsand then we have all the red cards verygood more about 61 for my 5 % sixty 1.57down okay now let 's see what 's theharder one here probability drawing aspade or a knee even so there is thismutually exclusive spade and even arethey mutually exclusive no no they'renotwhat 's the opposite of mutuallyexclusive inclusive inclusive very goodusually inclusive so these are mutuallyinclusive a mnemonic that I use when Ilearn it is like dating exclusively whenyou date exclusively does that imply adating with other people no noso it 's dating occurring here and notsimultaneous to dating elsewheredepending on your definition of datingof course there you go slide right thisone here probablyright and I I simplified the first oneand then when I try to do the other oneit was like half a number and justthinking okay can you walk and walk usthe process is the probability of Johnnyspade is 50 cubed by the make fourbecause there 's four guns cards foursuits so spor would be 13 out of 52 49to 52 space yeah put it down13 out of 52 I 'll even put here Spadeand then an even card in general is halfthe 52 adult no it 's half of races soyou sorry well from half of things wellthat 's actually going through what arethe 10 2 4 6 8 10 14 16 20 20 2 4 6 8 10I did n't ask for oh then you'resubtracting from it is that what you'redoing still acting this bait from that Iwant to subtract space at the end likewe did before I 'm standing in eveningcard yeah there 's 20 a minute there 's 20there 's 20 in totalyeah five different even cardsthere 's four twos four fours or 16 or 18port heads so great so you have a fourof each of those five cards and 120right so we have a plus 20 G 's are at 52these are evenshowever mutually inclusive there isoverlap between spades and evens sothat 's the major question as we sum uptoday 's lesson how many cards are thosespade and even 5 5 5 it 's 10 10 oh nothat 's fine fine it 's not black marketspace I know what was the essence of allthis so it 's 5 indeed it 's 5 francs sothere 's much debate as a to Spain DeltaForce pay that 's a 6 or you need to buythis buy sure do agree that there 's 2 46 8 10 are the even parts times 4 makes20 of them of those 20 cards which arespades 4th of them because there 's foursuits in every day your spades diamondsclass and hearts so of the spades yeahlet 's even start talking about twosthere 's four twos right there one ofthose is a spade okay and then there'sfour forces for every fourth yeah everyfourth card is the space it 's a spaceright so how do you figure out from thishow many even cards are spades becauseyou know that there 's 20 even cards ingeneral so your best bet for yeahme so minus fiveokay you have the answer for us okayyes 28 over 52 one night over 13 over 52seven over 13 let 's do some posits workokay so let 's finish it out oh we knowyou remind me of probability rolling at306 odds of rolling at 320 penis one twofive very good one two fiveyeah hope you can do it eventually yeahas long as you 're very clear than in twoknotsyeah yeah odds are always for yousuccess to fail leader yeah success tofailure so there 's one chance of successoh right my chances of failure ofgetting it three okay yeah you rentedthis ratio format question okay whatwe 're defining the probability ofsuccess over total outcomes you agreethat there 's one way out of six to getthe three okay and now definition ofsuccess failure so are they rolling a 3the probability at billion three is 1/6the only one to all the not threes whichis five let 's try with hearts how muchof the deck is a heart searching 39:52so 1/4 that 's safe to sayso 1/4 to protect their hearts so what'sthe odds of drawing my heart plate this30 million went to one two three doesthey want to use it you could n't use theother one and then yeahthat 's it that was probability andswelling board and some pods fewyourselves a hand very good [ Applause ] [ Music ] Statistics - Probability using "OR", and
