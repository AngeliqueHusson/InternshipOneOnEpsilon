you know welcome to the tech backchannel what we 're going to be having alook at in this video is how to dividedecimals okay ha now look dividingdecimals is much like dividing normalnumbers it 's just got a couple littletweaks to it and especially if you'vealready started multiplying decimals andyou 're pretty confident with that you'llprobably be pretty good with this so I'mgoing to go through a few examples toshow this so first off the example wemight use is what we will use is we willdo twenty five point six eight and we'regoing to divide that by zero point fournow when we do this as I said it'sfairly similar to normal division infact I 'm going to treat this initiallylike normal division so I 'm going toactually treat this like two thousandfive hundred and sixty eight divided byfour and then we 're going to deal withthe decimal I see because it 's going toend up in the same numbers it was twothousand five hundred sixty eightdivided by four it 's just the decimalplace is going to be in a different spotso first off let 's do this in so let'sgo to five six eight and we 're going todivide thisby fall so let 's do this now four intotwo we can not do so I put a 0 then 4into 20 5 that goes six times because 64s and 24 and we 're going to carry the 1because there 's 1 left over 4 into 16goes four times with no remainder andfor you two 8 goes two times so ouranswer is 642 ok so how do we do in thisdecimal place now it 's really reallyeasy but it 's a great question so firstoff what we do is we count the number ofdecimal places here ok so there 's onetwo decimal placesthis is in our number that we'reactually dividing and this is a numberwe 're dividing by okay and there 's onedecimal place and we get this over heretoo we take this one away so to takeaway one is one okay so we 're going tohave one decimal place so with our onedecimal place the men 's area has onedecimal way so our answer is sixty fourpoint two okayall right how did you go with that Itell you what we 'll give you one moreexample with this rough it out and ourexample will be as follows so you justyou 're just going to do that with adecimal place in it so it 's fairlysimple but you know how to do it so whydo n't we do this one thirty two pointone five and we 're going to divide thatby zero point zero zero fivenow look being $ 5 you know this isgetting on fairly nice we 're going totreat this once again why three two onefive three thousand two hundred fifteendivided by five so let 's do this down sothese different color now five and athree we ca n't do so I 'm going to put azero down there 532 goes six times withtwo left over five into twenty one goesfour times with one left over and 5 into15 those three times so we get thisanswer is 643 so we have Knauer ca n't weca n't with a decimal places they'regoing to go we have three numbers heremaybe khana decimal ways we have one twothree numbers herethat 'll be hung a decimal I said to takeaway 3 is minus 1 now this is a bit of atrick help me put a minus 1 decimalplace in I 'll show you how this is howso you know 643 and instead of goingthis way okay I 'm putting a decimal waysee why does wise we 're actually goingon - where I 'm going to go this way okayyeah someone 's gon na go here yeah we puta zero so our answer is six thousandfour hundred and thirty so if you'regetting these negatives you 're actuallygoing to add on an extra zero or anextra couple of zeros okay just a littletrick to be aware ofI tell you what I reckon we 'll do onemore so the one will do now is asfollows we will go six hundred andthirty eight point one and we 're goingto one nine and we aim to divide that bylet 's divide this by died so let 's writethis out as usual 6 3 8 1 9 and we'regoing to divide that by nine so let'sstop being our answer here so going tothe 6 we ca n't do died of the 63 or $ 763 so it 's 79 into 8 we ca n't do so intozero there and carry the 8 so 9 into 81goes nine times and 9 into 9 goes onceso we have this answer of 7090 wonderhow many decimal places are we going tohave we have two herewe have none they are so to take awaynothing is we should end up with 2decimal places ok so to take awaynothing is to so we 're going to end upwith one look one two decimal places andI put it up there where it 's supposed togo okay let 's put another on part so ouranswer is 70 point nine one how did yougo with that good alright hopefullyyou 're really really confident withthese and any questions comments putthem down we 'll see you next time -kanpai Dividing Decimals Dividing Decimals Dividing Decimals
