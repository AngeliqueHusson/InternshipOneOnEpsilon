we 're asked to rationalize and simplifyand once again rationalize this partright here just means to get rid of anyof the square roots or any of theradicals in the denominator so we reallywant to get rid of this somehowand it wo n't be as simple as multiplyingthe numerator in the denominator by theprinciple square root of x because if wedid that we would multiply the principlesquare root of x times this and thatwould get rid of the radical here butthen you would have negative one timesthe principal square root of x so itwould still stick around the denominatorso the way to rationalize something likethis where you have a binomial with awith a radical in it in the denominatoris two x the this is a fancy word I'mabout to say by the conjugate of thedenominator so you have square root of xminus 1 and so what you do is you wantto multiply the denominator by thesquare root of x plus 1 and I 'll showyou in a second why why we 're doing thatand of course anything you multiply thedenominator by you also have to multiplythe numerator by otherwise you'reactually changing the changing the valueof the of the expression so this is justgoing to be 1 so we 're just multiplyingthe whole thing by 1 and the key that Iwant to point out is why this is goingto work why does it make sense tomultiply by once again fancy word theconjugate and the conjugate will show upmainly when you 're trying to rationalizedenominators like this or when you'retrying to get imaginary numbers outsideof denominator so in this case we wantto get rid of a radical and in futurevideos we 'll try to get imaginarynumbers and do n't worry if you don'tknow what those means out of radicalsbut that 's where the conjugates shows upit 's a fancy word but all it means is ifI have a plus B the conjugate of a plusB is just a minus B so literally I justswapped the sign right over there andwhy it 's good to multiply an expressionlike this times its conjugate is becauseyou end up getting a difference ofsquares if you do a plus B times a minusB and we 've seen this multiple timesthis is the same thing this is equal toa squared minus B squared you can do thedistributive property twice and see howeverything simplifies out it comes outto a squared minus b squared so let'sapply that right overhere in our in the problem we need torationalize and simplify so let 's let'smultiply out the let 's multiply out thenumerator first just so that sincethat 's easy so we have x times thisentire expression over here so we candistribute the X so it 's x times theprinciple square root of x that 's the xtimes this right over here and then wemultiply the x times the 1 so plus X sothat 's our numerator and then ourdenominator we have a minus B times aplus B is one way to view it so that'sgoing to be a squared so think of itthis way think of this as a and think ofthe one as a B so this a minus B andthen this is a plus B so this is goingto be a squared minus B squared when youmultiply it out it 's you 're going to thedifference of squares so a squared so ifyou have the square root of x squaredthat 's just going to give you X so thisis going to give you this is going togive you X when you square this minus 1squared well what 's one squared wellit 's just 1 and so you could say that weare done but there might be let 's see isthere anything more that we could isthere anything more that we couldsimplify here well we could factor outan X if we have factored out an X wellthen you just have the x times thesquare root of x plus 1 not clear thatyou can simplify it any more so that'sthat 's that 's about right you couldwrite I guess one thing that you couldwrite is you could write this x timesthe square root of x you could writethat as since that 's X to the firstpower times X to the one-half power youcould write that as X to the threehalves power not clear if that'sactually a simplification but this isabout as good as you can do at least atleast from my point of view Rationalizing Denominators with Conjugates Rationalizing Denominators with Conjugates Rationalizing Denominators with Conjugates
