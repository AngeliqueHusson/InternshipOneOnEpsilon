so welcome to part one of my specialright triangle videos in this videowe 're going to go over a 30-60-90triangle and the reason why a 30-60-90triangle is called a special righttriangle is because the length of thelonger sides are proportional to thelength of the shorter sides so what do Imean by this let 's take a look at thelength of the shortest side now we knowthat the length of the shortest side isalways going to be opposite of the30-degree angle so let 's say that thisside which is a shorter side opposite of30 is a length of X we know in a30-60-90 triangle that if the shortestside has a length of X the hypotenuse isgoing to be double that so we know thatthe hypotenuse is going to have a lengthof 2x so now let 's take a look at theside that 's opposite of 60 degrees weknow that if this if the length of theshorter side has a length of X then thelength of this side opposite 60 degreesis going to be X multiplied by thesquare root of 3 so this is true for all30-60-90 triangles the the length of thesides are proportional to each other sowe can use this information to solvethese special right triangles actuallyquite easily so let 's get started rightaway with an example all right so let'sget started with a little easier examplelet 's say that this angle is 30 degreesthis angle is 60 degrees and we knowthat this angle is 90 degrees and thereason why it 's an easy example isbecause they give us the value that isgoing to be opposite of the 30-degreeangle or the value of the shortest sideand let 's say that the length of theshortest side is equal to 2 and like Isaid before we know that the length ofthe shortest side of the triangle isequal to our X so we know that our X isequal to 2 and like I said before alsowe know that the length of thehypotenuse is double the value of X orequal to 2xso if our length of the shorter side is2 our hypotenuse is double that or 2times 2 which is 4so the length of our hypotenuse is equalto 4 and the length of our side that isopposite of the 60-degree angle is equalto our X multiplied by the square rootof 3 so our X which is 2 multiplied bythe square root of 3 that is our lengthof the side that is opposite of our60-degree angle so now we havecompletely solved this this trianglelike I said this was an easier exampleso let 's go over a little bit harder oneall right in this example we are goingto be given the length of the sideopposite of the 60-degree angle so let'ssay that the length of the side oppositeof the 60-degree angle is equal to 3 andonce again the length opposite of the60-degree angle is equal to X multipliedby the square root of 3 so X multipliedby the square root of 3 is equal to ourvalue of the length of that side whichis 3 is equal to 3 all right so let'ssolve this equation for x we can get ridof the square root of 3 by the bydividing both sides by the square rootof 3 on the left hand side the squareroot of 3s cancel out and the only thingyou have left is X and on the right handside we have 3 divided by the squareroot of 3 our final answer can neverhave a square root in the denominator soI need to rationalize I 'm going tomultiply the top and bottom by thesquare root of 3 and I 'm running out ofspace so I 'm going to finish my work onthe bottom and we know that X is equalto 3 multiplied by the square root of 3and on the bottom we have the squareroot of 3 times the square root of 3which is justthree this can be simplified evenfurther our 3s cancel out so we knowthat our X is equal to the square rootof threeonce again our X is equal to ourshortest side of the triangle oropposite of the 30-degree angle so weknow that our X is square root of threeso the side opposite of the 30-degreeangle is going to have a length ofsquare root of three now if we know ourlength of X we it 's very easy to findour hypotenuse which is just double thator 2x so two times our X is just twotimes the square root of three so now wehave completely solved the trianglehypotenuse is 2 times the square root of3 our shortest side is the square rootof 3 and our side opposite the 60 isequal to 3 I hope this gave you a betteridea on 30-60-90 triangles I will bemaking a video on 45-45-90 triangles aswell so stay tuned and I will see you inmy next one 30-60-90 Triangles 30-60-90 Triangles 30-60-90 Triangles
