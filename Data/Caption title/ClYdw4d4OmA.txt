video going talk little bit order operation sand want pay close attention really everything else going going based solid grounding order even mean say order operation let give example whole point one way interpret mathematical statement let say mathematical plus times n agree order operation would two ways interpret ing statement could read left right could say well let take plus could say plus multiply times plus multiply times would get one way would interpret n order natural way go left right another way could interpret say like multiplication addition might interpret try color code plus times plus times would plus times plus notice statement two different ways straight left right addition multiplication way multiplication first addition got two different answer cool mathematics part effort send something moon two people different way another one computer one way another another way satellite might go completely unacceptable agreed upon order operation san agreed upon way interpret statement agreed upon order operation parentheses first let write n know exponent n worry right video going exponent dont really worry video multiplication right mult short multiplication multiplication division next kind level priority finally addition subtraction order operation let label right agreed upon order follow order operation always get answer given statement tell us best way interpret well parentheses parentheses look like little curly thing around n parentheses example parentheses n exponent multiplication division actually multiplication order operation multiplication division first say multiplication first multiplication say operation first get priority addition subtraction first get times add addition subtraction addition addition like multiplication first get add based upon agreed order operation right correct answer correct way interpret statement let another example think make thing little bit clear example pink let say plus put parentheses times divided minus times sort crazy thing follow order operation simplify clean way hopefully well get answer let follow order first thing look parentheses parentheses yes parentheses around plus say let first plus simplify looking order operation times let copy paste n keep writing times parentheses first parentheses expression exponent si n see exponent curious look like exponent would look like squared see little small top right n exponent n worry say multiplication division next see multiplication multiplication division multiplication multiple operation level order operation multiplication division level left right situation going multiply divide wo n multiply divided times subtraction right let figure multiplication first could simultaneously multiplication going change thing one step next step going times times times divided right remember multiplication division exact level going left right could also express multiplying would n matter order simplicity multiplication division go left right divided minus times division one division want division multiplication together actually kind simultaneously make clear subtraction multiplication division take priority addition subtraction could put parentheses around say look going first subtraction multiplication division priority divided going minus sign minus times minus equal negative correct interpretation want make something clear thing level minus plus minus addition subtraction level order go left right interpret plus thing minus plus minus minus plus minus thing minus thing go left right thing multiplication division level times divided times times divided times say divided well got fraction would would times times equal interpret n multiplication first divide one time order addition multiplication plus plus plus plus matter order plus go right left go left right could start place addition thing true multiplication times times times times matter order multiplication addition division subtraction best going left right introduction order operation arithmetic prealgebra khan academy introduction order operation arithmetic prealgebra khan academy introduction order operation arithmetic prealgebra khan academy introduction order operation arithmetic prealgebra khan academy introduction order operation arithmetic prealgebra khan academy introduction order operation arithmetic prealgebra khan academy introduction order operation arithmetic prealgebra khan academy introduction order operation arithmetic prealgebra khan academy introduction order operation arithmetic prealgebra khan academy introduction order operation arithmetic prealgebra khan academy introduction order operation arithmetic prealgebra khan academy
