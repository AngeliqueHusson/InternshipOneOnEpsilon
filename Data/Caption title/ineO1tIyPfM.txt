music going learn change pi way measure distance learn change value pi let review standard value youve told whole life pi first needsome high school geometry well pi defined ratio circumference diameter circle determine pi need measure circle precisely circle circle definition point fixed distance away central point distance matter since distance definition circle way measure distance affect shape circumference circle circumference circle affect usual way measure distance two point given formula variable like metric metric fancy word way measure distance draw unit circle centered origin definition point distance one point zero zero finally define pi ratio circumference diameter since circumference roughly six point two eight diameter two pi roughly equal plenty ways measure distance ways use everyday life let say dim trying give direction math museum math mo museum modern art id probably say block away one block east block north mathematician call taxicab metric taxicab traveling city grid move left right cant move diagonally taxi would distance block get mo math mo word distance taxicab metric mo math mo square root bird would metric general formula distance two point taxicab metric let try drawing circle radius three metric thats distance three origin taxi reach driving three block theyre distance three origin break reality ruin metaphor taxi instead physical taxi let look formula taxicab metric wan ted measure distance comma like taxi drive half block east two north well thats possible since would drive formula still works math reality taxicab distance minus plus taxicab distance origin point comma need put point circle radius fact know drive restriction drive left right diagonally need add bunch like negative two point three comma zero point seven one half comma negative one negative one point comma one point six point taxicab distance three origin belong taxicab circle three keep filling eventually get shape diamond thats taxicab circle pi ratio circumference diameter figure circumference need figure long four sides diamond looking shape length side point three zero point zero three need measure distance point taxicab metric get three zero two zero three drive west three block north six block total point distance six away line length six thats kind weird intuition might tell use theorem compute line length square root intuition theorem dont work taxicab land line length six fact similar reasoning length six mean circumference total length diameter six mean pi six four loo ked two different ways measure distance taxicab metrics circle metrics beginning episode area lot different ways measure distance let go back distance measured way way metric also cal led metric two formula replace two three swell get metric circle look like metric point x plus cube equal one circumference circle measured metric roughly six point five two value pi roughly three point two six theres nothing really special three actually replace number p thats greater equal call l p metrics theyre used time look like l p metrics p equal one get taxicab metric saw circle diamond p get little bigger closer two circle begin look like circle know love p equal two get normal p keep getting bigger circle start look like square limit p goes toward infinity turns square amazingly cool part pi p equal one value pi four p get little bigger closer two value smaller p equal two pi normal p keep value pi goes back toward four among l p metrics maximum value ratio diameter minimum pi minimum value pi actually metrics different give smaller value pi little complicated write detail description theres metric whose circle look hexagon value pi three exactly three fact theorem four metrics given technical term kind metrics weve looking value pi always pi always always kind close whats favorite metric let us know well see next time infinite series hello week comment response joint mathematics meeting huge math conference awesome privilege working press team mean ill spend weekend interview ing right going respond comment video hear shape drum wan ted know question make sense dimension sit fact make sense context famous milner pointed dimensional tour torus fancy math word doughnut really saying dimensional eigenvalue sense sound different shape huh got good chuckle people mora really used triangle symbol instead triangle squared triangle sometimes nabla symbol thing mathematically identical really like people debating symbol use really show mathematics aesthetic theres besides literal meaning matter keep thing expect two drum actually sound dont know u h real world thing work math world know two drum shave different produce eigenvalue sense sound theres detailed sense something could sound cal led homophonic included link thats sort technical thing think physical question interact space come drum interact hear idea answer question would love one real world could answer thats week see next week music pi infinite series
