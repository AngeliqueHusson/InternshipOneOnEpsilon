hello my name is Maria Miller from mathmy mouth calm in this video we 're gonnastudy volume and I intend this lessonfor about third or fourth grade volumemeans how much space something takes youhave a box you have a TV you have a bedtake some space we measure it in cubicunitsthat means cube shaped you little cubesand there are many different kinds ofcubic units and they are all based onour units of measurement for length soyou might have centimeters millimetersfeet inches and for each one of thosethere is a cubic unit for example onecubic inch means that this little cubeit has one inch side one each side andone inch side like thatone cubic centimeter means that thisidea is one centimeter this side is onecentimeter this is one centimeter andsimilarly for one cubic foot one foothere one foot here one foot here andlook at the cube out of that now thereare several ways to abbreviate a cubicunit and that 's what you already havedifficulty sometimes for example onecubic inch we have two ways toabbreviate it one in and a little threehere la baby 3 its an exponent we callit a one Cu period I am period andsimilarly for one cubic foot we have twoways to abbreviate it for metric unitsthere 's only one way to abbreviate themso that 's a little easier one and thensee him and this elevated 3 this 3 hereelevated 3 comes from the fact that weas if multiplied a centimeter threetimes by itself seen here this iscentimeter by a centimeter by acentimeterit 's like centimeters times centimeterstimes centimeterscentimeter multiplied by itself threetimes that 's where the three comes fromand children really need to use somemanipulatives of some real blocks tounderstand some basic ideas about volumeand cubelike I said children need to also playwith blocks or unit cubes if you havethem some kind of manipulative stick toget the feel for volume and hiatus andhow it is composed of cubic units onetype of exercise that schoolbooks alwayshave is the children just need to counthow many blocks are in some kind ofsetup such as here or here what is thevolume of this thing how many books arethereso we can see two here two here two atthe top and two behind here a total of 8cubic unitsanother thing children need tounderstand is the volume of a box or ofa rectangular prism and let 's look atsome examples here that I made basicallythe idea here is that you can justinstead of counting the blocks one byone you can just look how many are hereon the bottom and then go that manytimes how many layers up it goes that'stwo on the bottom and then two layers upin this one so a total of four righthere we have two on the bottom then wehave one two three four five layers upso five times two is ten blocksten cubic units in total are here youcan look at the bottom and even thebottom you can find out by multiplyingyou can find how many blocks they are bymultiplying 2 times 3 right and that isyour width and your depth width timesdeath 2 times 3 is 6 and then anotherlayer of 6 6 times 2 is 12 so even if Iadd here more you can still see the sameprinciple we can look we can look at thebottom and go 2 times 3 to find how manyblocks on the bottom layer and then thattimes 3 the height to get the totalvolume of this rectangular prism nowlet 's look at a few problems where wehave a box or a rectangular prism it'scalled but in third or fourth grade youcan call it a box it'ssimpler and we have to find its volumeas we already saw with the blocks youcan simply use multiplication to findthe volume of a rectangular prism of abox so let 's say I have this many blocksstacked together into a box shaped thingI want to find its volume I can usemultiplication I can check how wide itis how many units wide is this okay itis 1 2 3 4 4 units wide and how deep isit it 's just one unity and how high isit two units high and then I multiply 4times 1 times 2 and at 8 cubic unitscubed and units as its volume okay andyeah I did n't have any measurement unitto use I did n't say that these arecentimeters of 8 inches but I just use ageneric term units so that 's why thelength is just a unit and then the wholevolume will be cubic unit but here let'ssay that we are using centimeters as ourbasic unit so here would be this widethis width would be exactly 2centimeters and let me write it herewith 2 centimeters and then depth howdeep is it this way 2 centimeters andhow high is it 3 centimeters height is 3centimeters then we can get volume thisbig V is volume by multiplying 2 times 2times 3 which is 4 times 31212 cubic centimeters and lightly showme the blocks you can also think of thismultiplication this way take first ofthe bottom layer of this whole thing inthe bottom there 's two blocks times 2blocks that 's just 4 blocks on thebottom right and then you think of howmany layers high it is in blocks there'sactually 3 leverthree layers of three levels so we gofour times three the blocks on thebottom times how many layers you have 4times 3 equals 12so there 's 12 cubes here at the volumeis 12 cubic centimeters after childrenunderstand this idea how to calculatethe volume by multiplication and how itconsists of these individual littleblocks then they 're ready for other wordproblems here 's one find a volume of abox that is 20 centimeters wide 10centimeters deep and 12 centimeters tallthis is exactly the same situation as Ihave here we simply need to multiplythose three numbers so let 's go 20centimeters times 10 centimeters times12 centimeters and to multiply thesethree numbers where does zeros hereinvolved you can first ignore the zerosand multiply 2 times 1 times 12 which isthis 2 times 12 right 24 then you taggedhow many zeros we got here well uh nottoo high to zeros then that 's like alittle shortcut for multiplying by 10 or20 or whatever so 2400 and then ourcentimeter got multiplied by itselfthree times so we get the cubiccentimeters here you know centimetercube like it 's another word problem butthis time we are not asked the volumebecause we already know the volume thevolume is given here and it is askinghow deep is this box it is 2 centimetershigh3 centimeters wide how deep is it andthis time we need to think ofmultiplication again but this way 2times 3 times this number is 18 rightlet me write it 2 centimeters times 3centimeters times the depth that wedo n't know that has to equal 18cubic centimetres so simply two timesthree is six and so six times what is 18the other three centimeters okay so it'san easy problem in that sense butchildren need to notice that it is notasking for the volume you do notmultiply 18 times 2 times 3but you think in Reverse so to speakthis is a similar one similar problemagain we are given the volume we are notbeing asked what the volume is so wecannot go multiplying 27 times 27 times27 and it is a cube now that means thatthe width and the depth and the heightare equal it 's going to be the samenumber whatever number is here thatnumber times itself times itself givesus 27 and here children can use guessingcheck okay you know one times one timesone wo n't work right two times two timestwo wo n't work either but three timesthree times three will work we will getthree inches times three inches timesthree inches equals 27 cubic inches sothis here is 3 inches and lastly aproblem that again is not asking for thevolume it is a little different fromthese two again because it does not giveus the width the height the death itdoes n't give us those numbers it'sasking for the height what should theheight be of this room and it 's notgiving us the width or anything elseit 's giving us the area so how do we goabout that noneto find the volume I mean we 're giventhe volume but to calculate the volumewe would multiply this times this timesthis right and to calculate area youwould multiply this times this and thearea is given we know the floor area is12 square meters so this times this is12 we already know that so therefore thequestion is basically 12 times that isthird we will get 12 square meters heretimes something which is the heightequals 30 cubic meters the volume okayand to solve this you can again useguessing checklet me guess 12 times 224 that won'twork 12 times 3 36 it 's too much butthirdly my answer is exactly midwaybetween 24 and 36 right 2014 12 36did n't work but third is exactly themiddle of 24 and 36 so it can not be 2here can not be 3 here but it 's exactlyhalfway between 2 & 3 2 & 1/2 rightanother way to solve this is by usingdivision because it is a multiplicationproblem where it is missing a factor andso I can use the opposite operationdivision to solve it and I will dividethis by this 30 divided by 12 but let mewrite the division using the fractionline because now we can use what we knowabout fractions we can write this as amixed number first30:12 would make two holes and then 6 12right and 6 12 is exactly 1/2 2 and 1/2and this is in meters the answer is inmeters Volume of a rectangular prism and cubic
