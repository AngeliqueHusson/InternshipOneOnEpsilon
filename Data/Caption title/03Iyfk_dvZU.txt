hello my name is Maria Miller from mathmy motive come in this video we 're gonnastudy acute opportunities and righttriangles and I 've met this lesson forapproximately fourth grade levelnow here 's an acute triangle this meansthat all of its angles are acute andthen an obtuse triangle means that thetriangle has one obtuse angle and aright triangle means that the trianglehas one right angle but to make thesedefinitions stick in students minds Ilike to use drawing exercises where theywill do hands-on work and actuallyexplore and learn more about the animalsin these different kinds of triangles solet 's get started first draw all rightanimal animal not a triangle and thenmake it into a triangle and then measurethe other animals so let 's draw a righttriangle by first starting with an anglewith a right angle I will draw a rightangle the side lengths can be any so itdoes n't matter how long you draw thelines yes one side and then I need todraw a right angle and remember how todraw it right I need to line up myprotractor just right here at the 90degree mark and then over here there sonow I have my right hand on here and Ican make this into a triangle by drawingin the third side anywherehere-here-here lots of possibilitiesthere and now our task is to measure theother animals but you can know this theidea is to notice that this angle andthis angle are both going to be acuteanimals they are way less than 90degrees right so I 'll measure okay justa little over 30 degrees 32 degrees andthen over hereokay I got exactly 60 degrees and thatis quite normal that when you 're drawingand measuring that you it 's so hard tomeasure and draw very accuratelyespecially with my big marker pen thatthis kind of thing is normal I know inmy mind that these angles should add upto 180 degrees and it looks like theydo n't but what it is is either I measurethis a little off oh I drew this alittle off or do something up this isnormal and not nothing to worry aboutthe idea here is actually to notice thatboth of these other animals are IQ andthen students should repeat thisexercise using an obtuse angle to startit draw here an obtuse and somewherethere make it into triangle and measurethe angles and notice that the twoanimals have to be acute and they caneven make several trials maybe the taskwould be draw three different obtusetriangles and check I 'll draw severaldifferent right triangles and check okayand here we have another kind ofexercise on the similar lines it givesus two angles and then we need to checkwhat kind of triangle we get draw atriangle with 45 degree and 35 degreeangles then measure the third angle whatkind of triangle did you getso I need the first oh then it doesn'ttell me to their sides the side lengthsso I can choose my side lengths to beany I 'm going to draw siding here thendraw my 45-degree angle it 's going to bekind of like this right then I 'm gonnadraw my 35 it 's a fabric degree and overherenow 45 degrees these kind of exercisesalso gives students a lot of practicewith measuring animals and drawinganimals so they can just forget that andhere 's my 45 degrees then from here Iwill draw the 35 degree angle okay 35degrees so let 's make another thirdangle here need to line up theprotractor on its right okay this is nowfrom here all the way to here so I gofrom its past 90 degrees oh it seems tobe exactly 100 degrees so I got a knobto strangle them and I like drawingexercises for geometry because they'rehands-on and they help with the conceptsto stick in students mine lastly draw adiagonal into this rectangle a diagonalis a line from corner to some othercorner that goes inside the finger andthen what kind of triangles are formedso I basically need to draw a line fromthis corner to this corner and this isnot long enough so I 'll grab my regularruler I 'm gon na use this a regular rulerto draw a line and you know maybe you'regoing to student maybe you wantedstudents to make a guess as to what kindof triangles will be formed before theyactually draw the line okay and now Ihave two triangles what kind of trialsof it since it 's a true triangle andit 's another they actually converttriangles but this triangle here clearlyhopefully students notice that sincehere is a right angle then it is a righttriangleright triangles are formed but then whatis interesting is to repeat the sameidea using a parallelogram - aparallelogram other sketch one here realquickokay and then draw a diagonal into itand then check what kind of trianglesyou get then and this here is clearly anobtuse triangle right obtuse angle hereonto something here but what if I drewthe diagonal of the other way or had alittle bit different lookingparallelogram so this is something foryou to explore on your ownyou Acute, obtuse, and right triangles Acute, obtuse, and right triangles Acute, obtuse, and right triangles
