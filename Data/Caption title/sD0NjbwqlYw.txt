riem ann zeta function one object modern math lot might hear really difficult understand dont worry ill explain animation saw minute lot people know function theres prize anyone figure equal open problem known riem ann hypothesis may hear context divergent sum infinity see theres sense sum equal seem nonsensical obviously wrong common way define equation actually saying riem ann zeta function casual math enthusiast star ted read know definition reference one idea cal led analytic continuation complex valued function idea opaque unintuitive id like show zeta function actually look like explain idea analytic continuation visual intuitive way assuming know complex comfortable working temp ted say know calculus since analytic continuation derivative way present thing think might actually fine without jump right let define zeta function given input commonly use variable function one always sum ming natural example let say plug value like get keep reciprocal square happen approach pi squared around theres beautiful reason pi show might video later date thats tip iceberg function beautiful thing input like three four sometimes get interesting value far everything pretty reasonable smaller smaller amount sum approach number great craziness yet read might see people say zeta negative equal looking infinite sum doesnt make sense raise term negative fraction get natural obviously doesnt approach anything certainly right mercenary looking riem ann hypothesis know function said trivial negative even example would mean zeta negative plug give obviously doesnt approach anything much less right well well get negative value minute right let say thing seem reasonable function make sense greater one sum converge far simply defined value said riem ann somewhat father complex analysis study function complex input output rather thinking sum take number real number line another number real number line main focus understanding happen plug complex value example maybe instead plugging would plug youve never seen idea raising number power complex value feel kind strange first longer anything repeated multiplication mathematician found nice natural way extend definition exponent beyond familiar territory real realm complex value super crucial understand complex exponent going video think still nice summarize gist basic idea write something like one half power complex number split one half real part times one half pure imaginary part good one half real part theres issue raising something pure imaginary number well result going complex number unit circle complex plane let pure imaginary input walk imaginary line resulting output walk around unit circle base like one half output walk around unit circle somewhat slowly base thats farther away one like let input walk imaginary axis corresponding output going walk around unit circle quickly youve never seen wondering earth happen left links good resource description going move forward without main take away raise something like power one half squared times one half one half part going unit circle meaning absolute value one multiply doesnt change size number take one fourth somewhere plug zeta function one way think start term raised power think piecing together whose length reciprocal square like said converge six change input two get rotated amount importantly length wont change sum still converge spiral specific point complex plane let show look like vary input yellow dot complex plane spiral sum always going showing converging value zeta mean zeta defined infinite sum perfectly reasonable complex function long real part input greater one meaning input somewhere right half complex plane real part size number imaginary part dictate rotation want visualize function take input right half complex plane spit output somewhere else complex plane super nice way understand complex function visualize transformation meaning look every possible input function let move corresponding output example let take moment try visualize something little bit easier zeta function say f plug get well end moving point two point four plug get point negative going end moving point plug definition square going move negative going add colorful grid thing start moving kind nice something distinguish grid movement ill tell computer move every single point grid corresponding output function f look like lot take ill go ahead play time focus one marked point notice move point corresponding square little complicated see point moving reward give us rich picture complex function actually happen two dimension back zeta function infinite sum function complex number feel good happy plugging value whose real part greater one getting meaningful output via converging spiral cell visualize function going take portion grid sitting right side complex plane real part greater one gon na tell computer move point grid appropriate output actually help add grid around number one since region get quite bit alright first let appreciate beautiful mean damn doesnt make want learn complex function heart also grid begging extended little bit example let highlight represent complex imaginary part transformation make lovely arc abruptly stopped dont want know continue arc fact imagine version function definition extend left half plane might able complete picture something thats quite pretty well exactly mathematician working complex function continue function beyond original domain defined soon branch input real part less infinite sum originally used define function doesnt make sense get nonsense like non infinity looking version right half plane make sense begging us extend set point considering input even mean de fining extended function way doesnt necessarily use sum course leaves us question would define function rest plane might think could extend number ways maybe define extension make point say move maybe squiggle extension make land value mean soon open idea de fining function differently value outside domain convergence based infinite sum world oyster number extension right well exactly mean yes give child marker extend way add restriction new extended function derivative everywhere lock us one one possible extension know know said wouldnt need know derivative video even know calculus maybe yet learn interpret derivative complex function luckily us nice geometric intuition keep mind say phrase like derivative everywhere show mean let look back f example think function transformation moving every point complex plane point know calculus know take derivative function given input theres interesting property transformation turns related almost equivalent fact look two input space intersect angle consider turn transformation still intersect angle might get curved thats important part angle intersect remains unchanged true pair choose say function derivative everywhere want think angle property time two intersect angle remains unchanged transformation glance easiest appreciate icing curve turn still intersect right angle complex function derivative everywhere cal led analytic think term analytic meaning angle admittedly lying little little bit slight caveat want full detail input derivative function instead angle get integer point far minority almost input analytic function angle say analytic think angle think thats fine intuition think moment point really want appreciate restrictive property angle pair intersect ing remain unchanged yet pretty much function name turns analytic field complex analysis riem ann establish modern form almost entirely lever aging analytic function understand result pattern field math science zeta function defined infinite sum right half plane analytic function notice curve turn still intersect right angle surprising fact complex function want extend analytic function beyond domain originally defined example extending zeta function left half plane require new extended function still analytic still preserve angle everywhere force one possible extension one exist kind like infinite continuous jig saw puzzle requirement angle walk one one choice extend process extending analytic function way possible still analytic cal led may analytic continuation thats full zeta function defined value right half plane real part greater one plug sum see converge convergence might look like kind spiral since raising term complex power effect rotating one rest plane know exist one one way extend definition function still analytic still preserve angle every single point say definition zeta function left half plane whatever extension happen thats valid definition theres one possible analytic continuation notice thats implicit definition say use solution jig saw puzzle abstract derivation know must exist doesnt specify exactly solve mathematician pretty good grasp extension look like important part remain mystery million dollar mystery fact let actually take moment talk riem ann hypothesis million dollar problem place function equal zero turn quite important point get map ped onto origin transformation one thing know extension negative even get map commonly cal led trivial name stem long standing tradition mathematician call thing trivial understand quite well even fact obvious outset also know rest point get map sit somewhere vertical strip cal led critical strip specific placement non trivial encode surprising information prime actually pretty interesting function carry much information definitely think ill make video later right thing long enough ill leave unexplained riem ann hypothesize non trivial sit right middle strip line real part one half cal led critical line thats true give us remarkably tight grasp pattern prime well many pattern math stem far shown zeta function look like shown portion grid screen kind sell complexity highlight critical line apply transformation might seem cross origin however use version line look like notice passing number zero many many times prove non trivial sit somewhere line clay math institute give million dollar youd also proving hundred thousand modern math result already shown contingent hypothesis true another thing know extended function map point negative plug original sum look like saying infinity equal might seem disingenuous still call sum since definition zeta function left half plane defined directly sum instead comes analytically beyond domain converge jig saw puzzle right half plane said admit uniqueness analytic continuation fact jig saw puzzle one solution suggestive intrinsic connection extended value original sum last animation actually pretty cool going show guy derivative zeta function look like matter let guy know making video possible first foremost theres like supporting directly particular video also sup ported part provide audio book audio material actually use audible almost every day dont already listening literature one habit whether thats commuting jog ging cooking whatever real life changer one particularly good book recently listen art learning josh got due emphatic recommendation brother one think guy would like lot josh author national chess champion throughout childhood later life took martial art came world champion year man know take learn found lot say chest translate pretty meaningfully learning math well especially say starting end game listen art learning audio book free visiting going ur l give one month free trial let audible know came encourage support future video like one product used one happy recommend alright final animation derivative zeta function look like riem ann hypothesis analytic continuation riem ann hypothesis analytic continuation riem ann hypothesis analytic continuation riem
