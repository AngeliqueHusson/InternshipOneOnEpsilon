hi welcome math antic sin last geometry video learned quantity cal led perimeter basically outline shape video going learn also quantity cal led area help understand area let start line thats c long let imagine moving line perpendicular direction distance move leaves almost like end paint brush moving line way formed shape space surface covered along way area see much area square well original line c long move distance could say shape square centimeter like centimeter basic unit measuring length square centimeter basic unit measurement area example instead centimeter line meter long move meter area wed gotten would square meter mile long move mile wed square mile area like perimeter measurement important talking area alright give good idea area calculate area mathematically well theres special math formula equation use find area different shape sin video going learn formula square rectangle formula find area square rectangle multiply two side dimension together theyre usually cal led length width formula look like area equal length times width often written first letter word abbreviation area l length w width let see formula works original square centimeter multiply length c times width c get well x c x x c give us square centimeter write like exponent read centimeter squared shorter way writing c x whenever see like centimeter squared inch es squared squared squared know measurement quantity formula area equal length times width worked square let see works rectangle thats c wide c long tall first plug length width c x equal c x c c squared according formula area rectangle centimeter see thats correct bring back original square centimeter make see exactly square centimeter would area rectangle great let try formula one rectangle rectangle c long half centimeter wide formula area equal length times us need multiply two sides together get times one half equal one rectangle also square centimeter square centimeter even square ah shape take square centimeter area mean square shape mean total area would equal square centimeter see break rectangle half rearrange would form square fact use square like square centimeter measure area matter shape could rectangle triangle circle know find area square rectangle formula going learn formula finding area triangle going start rectangle dimension rectangle whats area well formula know area would x squared cut rectangle exactly half along diagonal line opposite corner sit form two triangle sand triangle exactly half rectangle mean area either triangle must exactly half area rectangle already calculated area entire rectangle squared area triangle must area triangle must squared since half ha formula area triangle half rectangle mean instead area equal length times width equal one half length times width yep thats basically one important difference instead l length w width going use two different triangle going call base height length width worked right triangle right triangle exactly half rectangle dont really work kind triangle like acute triangle obtuse tell side triangle something different first choose one three sides doesnt really matter side choose lot math problem base already chosen decide side base imagine setting triangle ground base flat ground like find highest point triangle vertex thats touching ground point draw line straight ground line draw must perpendicular ground length line tip triangle ground cal led height triangle oh people call height triangle altitude make lot sense pretend triangle tiny little music height line inside triangle like acute triangle sometimes outside triangle like obtuse triangle sometimes exactly one triangle sides like right matter formula finding area triangle area equal one half base times height know two measurement base height plug formula calculate area first might see formula could work three type triangle watch acute triangle box one half base times height cut triangle see perfectly inside wait theres obtuse triangle box thats one half base times height cut triangle perfectly inside box see formula area equal one half base times height works kind already figured area right triangle square let practice new formula calculate area last two triangle sour diagram show base acute triangle height plug value formula area get area equal one half times times forty one half area triangle squared dont forget measurement area always square pretty simple let try last example diagram obtuse triangle tell us base inch es height let plug value formula end equation area equal one half times times would calculate one half would dividing divided area obtuse triangle must square know basic area know area quantity measure square learned formula calculating area square rectangle area equal length times width youve learned formula calculating area triangle area equal one half base times dont forget practice youve learned working problem thats really get good math always thanks watching math
