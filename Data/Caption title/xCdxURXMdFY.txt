hi welcome math antic sin last geometry video learned quantity cal led perimeter basically outline shape video going learn also quantity cal led area help understand area let start line c long let imagine moving line perpendicular direction distance move leaves almost like end paint brush moving line way formed shape space surface covered along way area see much area square well original line c long move distance c could say shape square centimeter like centimeter basic unit measuring length square centimeter basic unit measurement area example instead centimeter line meter long move meter area gotten would square meter mile long move mile square mile area like perimeter measurement important talking area alright give good idea area calculate area mathematically well special math formula equation use find area different shape sin video going learn formula square rectangle formula find area square rectangle multiply two side dimension together usually cal led length width formula look like area equal length times width often written first letter word abbreviation area l length w width let see formula works original square centimeter multiply length c times width c get well x c x c c x c give us square centimeter write like exponent read centimeter squared shorter way writing c x whenever see like centimeter squared inch es squared squared squared know measurement quantity formula area equal length times width worked square let see works rectangle rectangle c wide c long tall first plug length width formula c c x equal c x c c squared according formula area rectangle centimeter see correct bring back original square centimeter make see exactly square centimeter would area rectangle great let try formula one rectangle rectangle c long half centimeter wide formula area equal length times width tell us need multiply two sides together get times one half equal one rectangle also square centimeter square centimeter even square ah shape take square centimeter area mean square shape mean total area would equal square centimeter see break rectangle half rearrange would form square fact use square like square centimeter measure area matter shape could rectangle triangle circle know find area square rectangle formula going learn formula finding area triangle going start rectangle dimension rectangle area well formula know area would x squared cut rectangle exactly half along diagonal line opposite form two triangle triangle exactly half rectangle mean area either triangle must exactly half area rectangle already calculated area entire rectangle squared area triangle must squared area triangle must squared since half ha formula area triangle half rectangle mean instead area equal length times width area equal one half length times width yep basically one important difference instead l length w width going use two different triangle going call base height length width worked right triangle right triangle exactly half rectangle n really work kind triangle like acute triangle obtuse tell side triangle something different first choose one three sides base n really matter side choose lot math problem base already chosen decide side base imagine setting triangle ground base flat ground like find highest point triangle vertex touching ground point draw line straight ground line draw must perpendicular ground length line tip triangle ground cal led height triangle oh people call height triangle altitude make lot sense pretend triangle tiny little mountain music yodel ing sometimes height line inside triangle like acute triangle sometimes outside triangle like obtuse triangle sometimes exactly one triangle sides like right matter formula finding area triangle area equal one half base times height know two measurement base height plug formula calculate area first might see formula could work three type triangle watch acute triangle box one half base times height cut triangle see perfectly inside wait obtuse triangle box one half base times height cut triangle perfectly inside box see formula area equal one half base times height works kind already figured area right triangle square let practice new formula calculate area last two triangle sour diagram show base acute triangle height plug value formula area get area equal one half times times forty one half area triangle squared n forget measurement area always square pretty simple let try last example diagram obtuse triangle tell us base inch es height inch es let plug value formula end equation area equal one half times times would calculate one half would dividing divided area obtuse triangle must square know basic area know area quantity measure square learned formula calculating area square rectangle area equal length times width learned formula calculating area triangle area equal one half base times height n forget practice learned working problem really get good math always thanks watching math antic see ya next time
