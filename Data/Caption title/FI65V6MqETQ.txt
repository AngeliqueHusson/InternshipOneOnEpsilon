I 'm going to talk about something reallyimportant the definitions of sine andcosine now you might remember fromgeometry the right triangle definitionsof sine and cosine it starts with aright triangle and we 'll label the threesides x y & z the acute angle here isTheta and this is a right angle wedefined cosine of theta to be the sideadjacent to theta divided by thehypotenuse by adjacent we mean the sidethat 's next to theta this is thehypotenuse it 's the long side of theright triangle and so that means x overz the sine is defined as the sideopposite theta y over the hypotenuse soy over z the problem with thisdefinition is that it only works foracute angles so that means that thetahas to be between 0 and 90 degrees rightor else this triangle wo n't make senseso one of the things we do inprecalculus is extend this definition sothat it includes all angles okay this iswhat an angle looks like in standardposition in standard position you drawthe angle so that its vertex is on theorigin in a coordinate plane this is theinitial side this is the terminal sideand you can think of an angle as arotation as if the initial if theterminal side were starting here androtating through an angle of thetaending here now add to that angle instandard position the unit circle thecircle with radius 1 x squared plus ysquared equals 1 is this circle here nowjust to get your bearings when you havea circle radius 1 it 's going to passthrough the point 1 0 it 'll pass throughthe point 0 1 negative 1 0 and 0negative 1same angle we want to we want to markthe point where the terminal sideintersects the unit circle that pointwill have coordinates XY we definecosine to be the x-value and sine to bethe y-value this point of course will beunique it 'll depend uniquely on theangle theta so for different angle thetais you 're going to get different sineand cosine values but this idea herewill allow us to measure sine and cosinefor any angle at all it 'll it 'll workfor the acute angles when theta is inthe first quadrant here it 'll work forzero degrees 90 degrees and any otherangle so this is the power of the unitcircle definitions is that they work forall angles and we 'll be using these forthe rest of the trigonometry course test
