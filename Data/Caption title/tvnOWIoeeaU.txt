Factor x squared minus 49y squared.So what 's interesting here is that well xsquared is clearly a perfect square.It 's the square of x.And 49y squared is also a perfect square.It 's the square of 7y.So it looks like we might have a special form here.And to remind ourselves , let 's thinkabout what happens if we take a plus b times a minus b.I 'm just doing it in the general caseso we can see a pattern here.So over here , this would be a times a , which would be a squared plus a times negative b , which would be negative ab plus b times a or a times b again , which would be ab.And then you have b times negative b , so it would b minus b squared.Now these middle two terms cancel out.Negative ab plus ab , they cancel outand you 're left with just a squared minus b squared.And that 's the exact pattern we have here.We have an a squared minus a b squared.So in this case , a is equal to x and b is equal to 7y.So we have x squared minus 7y , the whole thing squared.So we can expand this as the difference of squares , or actually this thing right over hereis the difference of squares.So we expand this like this.So this will be equal to x plus 7y times x minus 7y.And once again , we 're just patternmatching based on this realization right here.If I take a plus b times a minus b , I get a difference of squares.This is a difference of squares.So when I factor it , it must come outto the result of something that lookslike a plus b times a minus b or x plus 7y times x minus 7y .
