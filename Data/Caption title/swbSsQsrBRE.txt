welcome let explore triangle gon na unusual way go principle basically tell whole process well thats time go hour something goes famous puzzle thats going lead something interesting grid square sis start box end box id like walk start end allow take step right one square right one squared move diagonally well move left many ways kind go start end good number ways go write write write write write write write easy way mixture thing write write right right right right right id like know total number bit work play much simple us example anyway square weld one way star ted take right possible start square one fact think would ways get start square top row dont move right theres one option ditto row going column start one way get say bottom cell take let get little interesting cell many ways gon na walk cell well actually count go right go right theres two ways get one nothing little complicated let start writing tha tokay right right right right get right right right downright get right right downright like theres three ways fact nice listed next cell got could go right right right play game see theres actually four position could amongst three right theres four ways get look cell thats actually right two right theres really problem one letter bet guess listen next lord world gon na economy gon na rather go moment let cell many ways get well start listing could go right right right right go right right downright right thats fine list ill talk approach moment theres another way think way order get green dot got two option either get cell theres three ways theyre taking one three path go green dot get left three ways get could take one take single step right mean two give green dot grid cell three ways get take step go side left ways get take step right theres total three plus three six ways get particular cell fact argument beautiful allow quickly start filling rest cell diagram example get either get soil four ways get take one four path get still left six theres six ways take step right total plus get cell well mean si fill whole diagram pretty quickly plus plus plus said indeed counting plus fact get pretty quickly ten twenty thirty five fifty fifty six illness six one goi want two must look like go kind beginning cell right cell spot right corner right initially write formula weve actually done another video ked us video zero factorial one youve watched video know really hereto get e need take one two three four five six seven right right right right right right right one two three four step thats whats thats one possible route e course route would combination days seven always involve four going start really equivalent ask question many way going arrange word like seven zero one video learnt ways arrange word would number letter made factorial number seven factorial divided number four pictorial bet work indeed actually formula grid example really well whats coming one two three two theres total four thats really sick sector four factor two factorial right got triangle well sitting us right see look grid diagonally sideways thing diagonally instead looking row column would look diagonal way see first one one mess top see got let move trying famous triangle many different nation around literally thousand west tend give western scholar done something significant triangle probability theory question top must war right one top see let go back formula one represent many r one two three four five hour sand zero factorial equal one hour video would know number ways get range five would total number letter divided number factorial times backdoor pictorial well thats equal really factorial indeed follow formula thats accord formula would total number letter factorial divided made factor world live verd es made factorial make top grid turned thing sideways let go back order let write dean sorry theres next row let look believe said dan still cant one two three two three four tell us six letter two translate rotated picture little bit work think way say six really correspond put arm watch node thats cal led zero th row one well one throw either one hour row across sponsor two letter let call throw correspond two days two one lip kind soon look hour fifteen turns sixth verse represent triangle wrong four interesting look like goes triangle accounting beginning count four place four starting zero zero one two three count two place right zero one two actually think correspond b needs fifteen translate way diagonal picture two denominator said left weve right need come like counting set starting count zero example really well according triangle seem one zero one two three fourth row four zero one place left one two three place right indeed number four theres formula triangle finally got thank
