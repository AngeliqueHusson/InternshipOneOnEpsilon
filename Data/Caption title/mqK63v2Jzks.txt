PHIL MORIARTY : Right I 've got my trusty guitar on my back.Last few months I 've been working on a special musicalcollaboration related to a veryimportant number in nature.We 're about to head off down the road to meet thiscollaborator for the very first time , and I 'm veryexcited about it.We 're at the studio of Mr. Dave Brown , here -- DAVE BROWN : Hi ! PHIL MORIARTY : Yes , with his trademark `` hi , '' who 's a verytalented musician , producer.So we 're writing a song , a math metal song about phi.Math metal 's a genre which is very sort ofmathematically-based riffs , I guess.Very , very syncopated , very technical.And after we filmed a video on pi for Numberphile , a fewmonths , Dave got in touch and was keen to collaborate and toreally take that idea and push it further.And so what we 've done is we've based a song around tothe number phi , based the rhythms , based the melody -- ifyou can call it that -- based the lyrics , all around phi , the number phi.DAVE BROWN : First riff I've got in the song -- it 's a nice clean one . [ MUSIC PLAYS ] DAVE BROWN : Before we punch you in the face.And that 's derived from a riff Phil came up with -- as you can see here , quite conveniently -- from the different digits of phi.PHIL MORIARTY : What we also want to do as well as mappingthe digits of phi on to the melodies , on to the riffs , andon to the rhythms , is also somehow embed the geometry ofphi in the song.And the way we 're gon na do that is we 're going to takethe guitar string , length of the guitar string , and we'regoing to pick out the note which defines , or the positionon the string which defines the golden ratio , the note ofthe golden ratio , as it were.And so what we 're doing is -- this is a guitar string , from here to here.The fundamental definition of the golden ratiois you 've got AB.So you 've got a length A and you 've got a length B here.So A plus B over A is equal to A over B , andthat 's equal to phi.What we 're going to do now is use your wonderful goldenratio calipers -- where have they gone -- to define where that note is.It 's going to be a note that's not going to match up exactlywith to where -- though it 's not too far -- where we have a fret on the guitar.It 's just slightly below the 17th fret.And then what we 're going to do is we 're going to overdubon top of that , or maybe build it up -- we 'll see.As Dave suggested , what we 're going to do isthen build this up.So we 'll go from that , just below the 17th fret.Then we 're going to choose another note , which as you cansee is just around about where the screws in the pickup are.And then we 're going to subdivide that down again , each time building up and each time defining the note of thegolden ratio geometrically.DAVE BROWN : OK.So this next riff , I thought it 'd be quite cool if we tookthe number of chugs that a guitar plays -- technical term , a chug is when the guitar goes chnnh.Sounds like -- it's onomatopoeic.And we took a number of them and put a gap inbetween each one.And if you count the number of chugs between each gap , youactually get the number phi , which is quite cool.So take a listen . [ RIFF PLAYS ] So there was one chug , six chugs , one chug , eight -- yeah , you get the idea.PHIL MORIARTY : So these are gold nanoparticles , twonanometers across , in water.We 're not going to really use the nanoparticles.What we are going to use is the vial that thenanoparticles are in.But of course , it 's gold.It 's the golden ratio , so we thought it was apt.Well , I thought it was apt . [ MUSIC PLAYING ] DAVE BROWN : Next up , we get to a riff that 's kind of like thepi video that you guys did , where Phil mapped the digitsof pi onto a scale.We did that with phi onto the B-flat harmonic minor scale.I 'm not really good at musical tech.I do it by ear.Could I get him shouting into the mic ? I need to get a level , unfortunately.I 'll give you some volume so you can do it , but.PHIL MORIARTY : [ SHOUTS ] DAVE BROWN : ( SHOUTING ) Real but uncountable ! PHIL MORIARTY : I 've done this for a long , longtime , over 20 years.So I was in a band while I was a student.While I was a post-graduate as well . ( SHOUTING ) Irrational.DAVE BROWN : I did A-level maths.I got a C. I blame my teacher.I 'm more of a musician now.I have a YouTube channel called Boy in a Band.You can search for that.It 'll probably be in the description.I 'll make sure Brady puts it there.BRADY : I will even put it -- it 'll be just on this -- just there.DAVE BROWN : Oh , there we go.How about that ? BRADY : Cool.DAVE BROWN : But , yes.I make music of varying styles.Lots of electronic music , but I 'm horrendouslyinto metal as well.I just used horrendously twice.I hope that 's OK. ( SHOUTING ) Emerge from the equation ! Spirals out of control ! PHIL MORIARTY : One , six , one eight , oh , three , three , nine , eight , eight , seven , four -- It 's been a hell of a lot of fun.And I 'm really happy with the song.I think we 've done some very interesting things.We 've gone beyond -- people talk about math metal , but math metal , those riffssound complicated , but they're not really mapped onto maths.In this case , we 've actually gone beyond that.And there 's only one other band , to the best of myknowledge , that has attempted anything like this before , andthat 's a band called After the Burial . ( SINGING ) The proportion is divine.DAVE BROWN : So phi is 1 plus the square root of 5 over 2.So we decided to be a bit clever , and we have got 1 inthis by the open string on the guitar , representing that.And the other notes being played by the guitar are thedigits of square root of 5.And then over 2 , we go into half-time drums partwaythrough this , which I thought was quite clever , so . [ METAL MUSIC PLAYING ] BRADY : That 's quite clever , is n't it ? DAVE BROWN : Yeah.BRADY : You pleased with it ? DAVE BROWN : Yeah.PHIL MORIARTY : Some people mightnot consider it beautiful.I think the way that the maths are embedded throughout thesong , yeah , has its own bizarre beauty about.Yes . [ MUSIC PLAYING ] DAVE BROWN : And we do a similar thing forthe outro as well . [ RIFF PLAYS ] The 1 there is that [ HUM ] top note.Then we 've got the chugs.You remember what chugs are ? Doing square root of 5.And again , half-time drums.PHIL MORIARTY : Leibniz was a very famous mathematician , developed calculus independently of Newton.And he has this wonderful quote , which is that music isthe human mind counting when it doesn'tknow that it 's counting.And that 's great.There are these fundamental links between numbers , betweenmaths , to music.And it 's great to actually embed those so tightly as wedo in this song.BRADY : Well hopefully , by now , you 're all dying to hear thefinished song.I know I am.I have n't actually got the final copy from Dave yet.We 're going to upload it here on theNumberphile channel on Friday.If you 're watching this video after Friday , I 'll have thelink below the video , and you 'll be ableto find it , of course.Also below the video in the description , I 'll have a linkto Dave 's channel.You really should check it out.He 's a super-talented guy.And I 'll also have some information under the videoabout these golden mean calipers , which were sent tous from New Zealand.They 're lots of fun , and I'm sure you 're all going to havesome questions about them.And we 'll be using them in some future videos we 've gotcoming about the golden ratio on Numberphile in the weeksand months to come.But for now , we 'll hear the song on Friday .
