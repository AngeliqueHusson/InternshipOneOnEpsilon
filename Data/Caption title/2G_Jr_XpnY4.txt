Determine whether 380 is divisible by 2 , 3,4 , 5 , 6 , 9 or 10.They skipped 7 and 8 so we do n't haveto worry about those.So let 's think about 2.So are we divisible by 2 ? Let me write the 2 here.Well , in order for something to be divisible by 2 , it hasto be an even number , and to be an even number , your onesdigit -- so let me rewrite 380.To be even , your ones digit has to be even , sothis has to be even.And for this to be even , it has to be 0 , 2 , 4 , 6 or 8 , andthis is 0 , so 380 is even , which means it is divisible by2 , so it works with 2.So 2 works out.Let 's think about the situation for 3.Now , a quick way to think about 3 -- so let me write just3 question mark -- is to add the digits of your number.And if the sum that you get is divisible by 3 , then you aredivisible by 3.So let 's try to do that.So 380 , let 's add the digits.3 plus 8 plus 0 is equal to -- 3 plus 8 is 11 plus 0 , so it 's just 11.And if you have trouble figuring out whether this isdivisible by 3 , you could then just add these two numbersagain , so you can actually add the 1 plus 1 again , and youwould get a 2.Regardless of whether you look at the 1 or the 2 , neither ofthese are divisible by 3.So not divisible by 3 , and maybe in a future video , I'llexplain why this works , and maybe you want to think aboutwhy this works.So these are n't divisible by 3 , so 380 is not divisible.380 , not divisible by 3 , so 3 does not work.We are not divisible by 3.Now , I 'll think about the situation for 4 , so we'rethinking about 4 divisibility.So let me write it in orange.So we are wondering about 4.Now , something you may or may not already realize is that100 is divisible by 4.It goes evenly.So this is 380.So the 300 is divisible by 4 , so we just have to figure outwhether the leftover , whether the 80 , is divisible by 4.Another way to think about it is are the last two digitsdivisible by 4 ? And this comes from the fact that 100 is divisible by 4 , soeverything , the hundreds place or above , it 's going to bedivisible by 4.You just have to worry about the last part.So in this situation , is 80 divisible by 4 ? Now , you could eyeball that.You could say , well , 8 is definitely divisible by 4.8 divided by 4 is 2.80 divided by 4 is 20 , so this works.Yes ! Yes ! So since 80 is divisible by 4 , 380 is alsodivisible by 4 , so 4 works.So let 's do 5.I 'll actually scroll down a little bit.Let 's try 5.So what 's the pattern when something is divisible by 5 ? Let 's do the multiple of 5 ? 5 , 10 , 15 , 20 , 25.So if something 's divisible by 5 -- I could keep going -- thatmeans it ends with either a 5 or a 0 , right ? Every multiple of 5 either has a 5 or a 0 in the ones place.Now 380 has a 0 in the ones place , so it isdivisible by 5.Now , let 's think about the situation for 6.Let 's think about what happens with 6.So we want to know are we divisible by 6 ? So to be divisible by 6 , you have to be divisible by thethings that make up 6.Remember , 6 is equal to 2 times 3.So if you 're divisible by 6 , that means you are divisibleby 2 and you are divisible by 3.If you 're divisible by both 2 and 3 , you 'll bedivisible by 6.Now , 380 is divisible by 2 , but we 've already establishedthat it is not divisible by 3.If it 's not divisible by 3 , it can not be divisible by 6 , sothis gets knocked out.We are not divisible by 6.Now , let 's go to 9.So divisibility by 9.So you can make a similar argument here that ifsomething is not divisible by 3 , there 's no way it 's goingto be divisible by 9 because 9 is equal to 3 times 3.So to be divisible by 9 , you have to be divisible by 3 atleast twice.At least two 3 's have to go into your number , and thisis n't the case , so you could already knock 9 out.But if we did n't already know that we 're not divisible by 3 , the other way to do it is a very similar way to figure outdivisibility by 3.We can add the digits.So you add 3 plus 8 plus 0 , and you get 11.And you say is this divisible by 9 ? And you say this is not divisible by 9 , so 380 mustnot be divisible by 9.And for 3 , you do the same thing , but you test whetherthe sum is divisible by 3.For 9 , you test whether it 's divisible by 9.So lastly , we have the number 10.We have the number 10 , and this is on some level theeasiest one.What do all the multiples of 10 look like ? 10 , 20 , 30 , 40 , we could just keep going on and on.They all end with zero.Or if something ends with zero , it is divisible by 10.380 does end with zero , or its ones place does have a zero onit , so it is divisible by 10.So we 're divisible by all of these numbers exceptfor 3 , 6 and 9 .
