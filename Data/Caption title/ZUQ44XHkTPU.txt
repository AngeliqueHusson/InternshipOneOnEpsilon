one of the four main types of points ofconcurrency that we find in triangles isthe circumcenter point of concurrencymeans you have at least three linesintersecting in one spot so thecircumcenter is where the threeperpendicular bisectors of each sideintersect which also makes it the centerof a circle that circumscribed about thetriangle so if we take a look at asketch of what a circumcenter might looklike we notice that it could be a reallybig circle if you have an obtusetriangle and that it passes through allthree vertices which means that thecenter is equidistant from the threevertices but when we ever apply this inreal life well a common problem that youmight see on a test is if they give youthree different points and they saywhere 's the treasure the treasure islocated at an equal distance from threerandom points maybe a tree stump agravestone and the beach so what youwould do to find the treasure is youwould have to find the circumcenterof the triangle by drawing those linesso what you would do if we erased thistreasure is you would draw in your threesides of your triangle and then usingyour compass you would construct thethree perpendicular bisectors of eachside so there would be one perpendicularbisector and then here would be anotherperpendicular bisector and again this isjust an estimate to show you how youwould solve this problem and then hereyou 'd find your perpendicular bisectorand ideally by definition these pointsare concurrent as you can see I 'm alittle bit off but that 's just because Iwas sketching so you would say that thetreasure would have to be right herewhich is the center of a circle thatpasses through the three vertices test
