Hello , everyone ! Now , my attention was drawn to a recent Facebook pollby a friend of mine.Now , usually I tend to avoid these polls.They either tend to be rather banal , like what day of the week is it , with opinion divided in seven different directions , or they tend to be rather obvious , likewho 's better -- Busted or McFly ? With the answer obviously beingMcFly ! But this was curious . The question was : Or to put it another way , What 's the probability that you live in an odd-numbered house ? Now , I 'm going to give you a moment to think about that.What do you think it is ? And , well -- in the meantime , here 's a picture of an orangutan and a kitten . [ music plays ] Right.So what do you think it is ? What 's the probability that you live in an odd-numbered house ? Now you might have thoughtthat the probability was50/50.In other words , the probability is naught point five . [ 0.5 ] But it appears that the probability is slightly more than that , at naught point five oh two . [ 0.502 ] That means that you are slightlymore likely to live in an odd-numbered housethan in an even-numbered house.But how come ? When my attention had been first drawn to this poll , there had already been a quarter of a million responses ! 250,000 responses , with the breakdown looking like this : Odd : 125710 Even : 124653And you can see that the number of odd-numbered houseswas already starting to pull ahead by about a thousand.In fact , the proportion of odd-numbered houseswas already standing at naught point five oh two . [ 0.502 ] But , is this significant , or was it just down to chance ? I mean , certainly , if I took a coin , and I tossed it 250,000 times , I would expect the number of headsto turn up about half the time -- 125,000.But there 's no guarantee of that.You can get a run of good luckand end up wtih more heads than tails.In fact , it 's even possible , although very unlikely , you can get 250,000 tails in a row.But , if you perform the experiment repeatedly , you will end upwith a bell curvecentering around the mid value , 125,000 , with 95 % of resultsturning up in the range124,500 to 125,500.That 's the middle 95 % .You may have heard of this asplus or minustwo standard deviations from the mean.Now on the other hand,5 % of resultswill be outside this range.Now , these are going to be the more extreme results , but still perfectly normal.I mean , for example , if I perform the experiment twenty times , and I get one resultoutside that range , that will be as expected.Now the poll so faris outside this range.Now , that does n't mean that the answer is n't 50/50.But it is evidence that there is a bias towards odd-numbered houses.Now , it does n't confirm the bias , but it 's just a failure to reject the ideathat there is bias.A couple of days later , the poll had reached 400,000 responses , with the breakdown now looking like this : Odd : 211,803 Even : 209,264Now , that theoretical 95 % intervalgets more narrow with more responses.The proportion of odd-numbered houses herewas still naught point five oh two . [ 0.502 ] So in fact , this was now falling even widerof the theoretical 95 % interval.And if it was 50/50 , I 'd be expecting the opposite to happen.So why is n't it 50/50 ? Think about the number of odd-numbered housesin streets with an even number of housescompared with an odd number of houses.If your streethas an even number of houses , then the proportion of odd-numbered houseswill be 50 % .It does n't matter if your street contains 10 houses , or 50 houses , or a thousand houses.The proportion of odd-numbered houseswill be 50 % .But that 's not true if your street contains an odd number of houses.For example , if your street contained three houses -- one , two , three -- then two of those three houses will be odd numbered.If your street contained five houses -- one-two-three-four-five -- then three of those five houses will be odd numbered.The proportion of odd-numbered houses is slightly more than 50 % .And so , all together , the average is tending towardsa number greater than 50 % .And that 's due to streets that contain an odd number of houses.So , even though we can now see that the proportionof odd-numbered houses is going to be greater than naught point five [ 0.5 ] , justifying why it appears to be naught point five oh two [ 0.502 ] is going to be more difficult.But , roughly speaking , assuming a typical street can range in size from one to a thousand , the average proportion of odd-numbered housescan be calculatedto be naught point five oh two [ 0.502 ] .Now obviously , there 's going to be exceptions to this.There 's going to be streets that have more even-numbered housesthan odd-numbered houses.Or even streets that only have even-numbered houses.But by the same token , there 's going to be exceptions in the other direction as well.There are going to be streets that have moreodd-numbered housesthan even-numbered houses.And I 'm going to say that these exceptionsare either going to be insignificant , or they 're going to cancel each other out.Either way , they 're going to be drawing the proportion of odd-numbered housesback to naught point five oh two . [ 0.502 ] Now , credit for this goes to my friend Chris Draper , but apart from that , as usual , if you have been , thanks for watching . test
