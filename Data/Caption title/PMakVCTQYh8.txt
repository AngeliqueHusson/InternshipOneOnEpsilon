youhey I 'm making a storage shed in mybackyard and I 'm at the point where I'mputting the roof together and makingthese roof trusses here at a two byfours and a piece of plywood before Istarted putting these together I had todecide how steep I wanted my roof inmathematics we call how steep somethingis the slope roofers call that the pitchof a roof they talk about the pitch ofour how steep it isand they often refer to how they talkabout the rise and the run just like youdo with slope slope is rise over run butthey usually refer to slopes assomething in 12 4 and 12 5 and 12 6 and12 and let 's go up here and have a lookat thisso again if that 's the angle of that theroof is gon na be you would roofers talkabout how far in 12 is you go 12 inchesover how much does it rise so if youhave a slope up if you have a pitch upor in 12 for every 12 over does for upnow I wanted a pretty steep here just tomake sure ice and snow and rain andalmost stuff one of the trees slides offof there plus then I get a bunch morespace up here I actually wanted a roofpitch that 's more like 8 in 12 actuallywhat I have here is I have three and ahalf feet this way for five feet thatway the building is 10 feet across sohalf of it is 5 feet the rise is threeand a half run is five now I want to Iwant to know how that compares tostandard roof pitches so I 'm gonnaconvert it to something in 12 I 'm gonnado that now on paperall right so to figure out how our roofcompares to standard roof pitches we'regoing to use some similar triangles hereour roof is 3.5 feet the rise and therun is 5 feet now we want to know howwould that compare if this was 12 so I'mgonna Majan that it 's 12 feet we want toknow how high up does that go if thiswere a similar triangle which means ifthat angle is the same which it isbecause it 'd be the same angular roofand then when we measure it that 's aright angle we measure the rise we'remeasuring straight up and then of courseif you have two angles the same thethird one has to be the same those twotriangles are similar triangles becauseall the angles are the same that 's ourunknown we want to know how high up doesthat go for 12 we can write a proportionhere because a property of similartriangles is that the sides are inproportion so three point five dividedby five has to be the same as X dividedby 12 now to figure that out we can justfigure out how many times more that isand then use that same factor tomultiply there so we 'll get ourcalculator so we want to know now what's12 divided by five so we know this istimes two point four and then we know wehave to multiply this by two point fourso if we go three point five times twopoint four we have eight point four wellthat 's what our that 's what our risewould be if it were 12 so we got a slopeof a boat well eight point four in 12that 's our roof pitch all right that'sabout what I wanted before I said Iwanted it about eight in 12 it 's prettyclose a little bit more all rightthat 's using similar triangles to findthat length of that unknown side therewhich happens to be the rise of the roofpitch now while we 're while we have thistriangle here this ratio we use thisthis divided by this or this divided bythis if you 're looking at that trianglefrom the samedown here that 's the opposite side andthis is what you call the adjacent sideit 's right next to the angle that 's animportant ratio when you 're talkingabout triangles and starting to talkabout trigonometry the opposite dividedby the adjacent is actually the tangentratio and what we 've looked at here isthe tangent of this triangle has to bethe same as the tangent of this trianglebecause those angles are the samethat 's why trigonometry works if youknow an angle you know the ratio so ifwe divided this ratio that would be thetangent ank the tangent ratio for thosetwo triangles so that 's a little bit oflead into trigonometry too and that 's it "A Roof Over Your Shed" (part1)...
