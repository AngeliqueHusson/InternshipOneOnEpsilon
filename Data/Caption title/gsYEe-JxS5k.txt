okay in this video I want to do a couplemore examples about applying rules ofexponents and these are going to be alittle more complicated we 're combininglots of ideas some of them will be youknow things that we 've seen in previousvideos but one of the new ideas is wecan simplify okay so remember you knowwhen we were multiplying if we had likebases X to the N times X to the M whatdo we do well we added the exponentswith what the rule said but now insteadof multiplying we have division wellmultiplication says add the exponentswell division ends up corresponding tosubtracting the exponents so there 's twoways to think about it you can basicallycombine them by taking it 's the samebase you take the top exponent minus thebottom exponent that would go in thenumerator of the fraction you can thinkabout all this as being over 1 orlikewise you can take you can just leavethe thing in the bottom and thensubtract away the exponent on the top soI 'll make use of both of these rules theother property it says remember X if youhave X raised to a negative exponent youcan rewrite that as 1 over X to thepositive in so a little tricky heredefinitely I think some places to to gowrong so hopefully we 'll do ok hereso I 've got my first example 3x squaredY to the fourth to the fifth over 3xcubed Y to the seventh to the third soremember the first rule it says you ifit 's in parentheses you just multiplythe exponents so one times five would be3 to the fifth then we would have our xsquared to the fifthwe 'll take two times five that 'll giveus X to the tenth and then we 'll haveour Y since it 's four and five wemultiply those and that gives us to the20th power now on the bottom again I'mgoing to stick my little exponent inthere we would have 3 raised to thethird power we have our X cubed beingcubed so again we multiply 3 and 3 willgive us to the 9th power and then wehave Y to the 21st power okay somepeople will start multiplying out 3times 3 times 3 a little bit 5 times andget a big number and then they 'll take 3cubed and get I guess it 's 27 and thenwe 'll start simplifying but it 's mucheasier just to use properties ofexponents straight away to help yousimplify so what I 'm going to do the wayI do these my own personal preferenceyou can always take the top minus thebottom so maybe let 's do that just toillustrate and then I 'll kind of showyou what I do to maybe make it a littlefasterso okay so I see that there 's threes sothere 's the same base one thing you cando is you simply take the top exponentminus the bottom exponentand then we would have X to the 10thminus 9 so 10 minus 9 so I 'm taking thetop minus the bottom and then we wouldhave Y if I leave the top exponent andthen I subtract away the bottom exponentwe 'd have 20 minus 21 and you can thinkabout all this as being over 1 webasically move to everything to thenumerator so let 's see this is going togive us 3 to the second power that'sgoing to give us X to the first powerthis is going to give us a Y if we take20 minus 21 that 's going to give us tothe negative first power so again youcan think about all this as being justdivided by one that does n't change itsvalue typically people do n't want to seenegative exponents at all people want tosee only positive exponents sinceeverything is being multiplied and thisis something that 's important if therewere any pluses or minuses inside ofhere you have to be careful about youknow moving things around but the rulesays if everything is being multipliedon the top there 's only one thing on thebottomas long as if there were more things onthe bottom as long as there wasmultiplication you can move thingsfreely so 3 squared is going to give us9 X to the first will give us just X Ihave Y to the negative first I can puthim in the denominator and he becomes tothe positive first power so we couldsimply write this as 9 x over Y and thatwould be our solution typically what Ido you know I kind of again skip thisstep what I doyou know so maybe looks a just anotherway to think about it to me it 's alittle faster I do the same thing so Ilook at my threes I see 3 to the 5th and3 to the 3rd to me the bigger exponentis on top if I take the bigger numberminus the smaller number 5 minus 3 is 2wherever the bigger exponent is thenumber will stay on that side of thefraction ok likewise we have X to the10th over X to the 9thsince the bigger exponents on top I knowthe X is going to stay on top of thefraction and then I take the biggernumber minus the smaller number 10 minus9 would be 1 then I look at my Y 's Ihave Y to the 20th and Y to the 21stwell 21 is a bigger exponent than 20 sothe Y 's are going to live on the bottomof the fraction and I take the biggernumber 21 minus 20 and that gives me tothe first power and then we can simplify3 squared will be 9x over Y this is myown personal preference this is what Ilike to do I take the bigger minus thesmaller and wherever the bigger exponentis that 's where the variables will stayfor that base this way I kind of skippedthis step about having to do negativeexponents and then shuffle things aroundeverything just ends up correctly beingin the right place do n't have to do itagain you know all roads lead to Rome sowhichever way you preferokay so let 's do our set our secondexample as well so we have 5x y squaredto the fourth over 5x squared Y to thesixth we 'll do the same thing here so wewould get five to the fourth when wemultiply we can stick our X to the firstin there so we would get X to the fourthtwo and four is to the eighth power onthe bottom one in x six will be six wehave x two times six will be 12 y to thefirst being raised to the sixth poweragain we multiply that will give us justY to the sixth power and now I 'm goingto do the same trick that I showed youat the end I 'm just going going to justhopefully put things in the correctplace so I look at my fives okay so I'mlooking at my fives I have like bases soI can combine them I look at theexponent well 6 is bigger than four sothe 5s are going to stay on the bottomif I take six minus four that 's going togive me to the second power likewise Ilook at my X 's next so I have X to thefourth over x squared well again X theexponent of 12 is bigger than theexponent of 4 so the X 's are going tostay in the bottom if I take 12 minus 4that gives me X to the 8th and then I dothe last thing with my Y 's okay I lookI 've got the same base y to the 8th overY to the sixth ok well now the biggerexponent is in the numerator so the Y'swill stay on top and then again I justdo the same thing 8 minus 6 will be tothe second power and then usually theonly kind of simplification is just thenumerical part so we 've got Y squared ontop 5 squared is 25 and then we have Xto the 8th left overthat would be how this originalexpression would simplify down soalright just a couple different ways tolook at it I hope that does n't confuseyou at all again I think a lot ofalgebra and math in general is finding away that works for you and that you'recomfortable with so you know definitelyfeel free to use either way they botheventually get you to the same correctanswer Applying the Rules of
