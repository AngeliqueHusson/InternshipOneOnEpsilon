hello today going talking difference convex concave polygon know polygon series sides connected closed loop forming shape right polygon polygon series sides start connect close space notice must least three sides two sides close loop make whats cal led closed loop whats difference convex concave polygon well convex polygon polygon choose two point going choose arbitrary point choose two point connect line segment line segment never exit line segment always notice choose one maybe choose one notice try connect theyre still inside shape theyre edge theyre still part shape right theyre still either inside edge shape thats convex usually look bit bulgy usually based whether look old g like wave size would stick right going label going polygon mean sorry convex use wrong word theyre convex concave polygon hand opposite opposite case true concave polygon going make one choose two point one case line polygon look choose line segment choose form line segment inner part line segment actually leaves right little portion inside shape polygon concave polygon going draw useful little piece information know lots different concave polygon let see many sides make kind notice make triangle however make pentagon kind main rule case inside polygon chosen line segment formed point line segment polygon come handy next couple hope pretty clear definition thanks watching concave convex polygon concave convex polygon concave convex polygon concave convex polygon concave convex polygon concave convex polygon concave convex polygon
