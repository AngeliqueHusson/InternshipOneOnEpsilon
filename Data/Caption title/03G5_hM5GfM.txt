hello so today we 're going to be talkingabout the difference between convex andconcave polygons so as you all know apolygon is just a series of sidesconnected in a closed loop forming someshape right this is a polygonthis is polygon just a series of sidesthat and where they start that connectall up to close this space off noticeyou must have at least three sidesbecause two sides do not close off thatloop or make what 's called a closed loopso what 's the difference between aconvex and the concave polygon well aconvex polygon is a polygon in which youcan choose any two points we 're justgoing to choose some arbitrary twopoints but the point is that you canchoose any two points and when youconnect them with a line segment thatline segment will never exit the shapeso that line segment will always becontained and notice we can choose thisone maybe and we can choose this onenotice we try to connect those they'restill inside the shape they 're on thevery edge but they 're still part of theshape right they 're still either insideor on the edge of the shape so that'sconvex and they usually look a bit bulgyso you can usually classify them justbased on whether they look old G or notlike this where the wave size wouldstick out right these are I 'm going tolabel these these are going to be calledconcave polygons I mean sorry convex usethe wrong word they 're from convexconcave polygons on the other hands arethe opposite the opposite case is truefor these so for concave polygons I'mjust going to make one here for you ifyou choose any two points in in one caseif not more you will have a line thatexits the polygon so look here if wechoose this line segment we choose twopoints we can form a line segmentbetween them and the inner part of thatline segment actually leaves right thislittle portion here is not inside theshape the polygon this is how youclassify concave polygons I 'm just goingto draw some more here but it 's just auseful little piece of information toknow there can be lots of differentconcave polygons let 's see how manysides we have on this 1 2 3 4 5 6 2 3 45 you can make all kinds of differentones notice that you can not make it witha triangle you can however make it witha Pentagon and all kinds of differentpolygons but the main rule is that thereis a case inside this polygon when twopoints chosen when a line segment isformed between them will have points onthat line segments that are not pointswithin or on the polygon so this willcome into handy in the next couple ofvideos but I hope this is a pretty cleardefinition and thanks for watching Concave and Convex Polygons Concave and Convex Polygons Concave and Convex Polygons
