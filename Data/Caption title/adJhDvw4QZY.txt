in this video we 're doing anotherrelated rates problem and this is theclassic ladder sliding down the wallproblem there are a lot of variations onthis problem but in this particular onewe 've been told that we have a 41 footladder and I 've started putting togethera diagram of what the problem says so wehave a 41 foot ladder it 's sliding downa vertical wall so here 's our verticalwall and the ladder is sliding down thewall which is indicated by this greenarrow while its bottom slides away fromthe wall so of course that makes senseif the ladder is sliding down the wallso the top sliding down that 's going topush the bottom out to the right thiswayso the ladder is sliding away from thewall at 4 feet per second we 've beentold then the question is how fast isthe top of the ladder moving so thispoint right here the top of the ladderhow fast is that point moving when thatpoint is 9 feet above the ground or 9feet off the ground so what that tellsus is that the distance from the top ofthe ladder to the ground is 9 feet atthe time that we 're interested in sowhat we need to find is the rate ofchange of the top of the ladder or wecould think about it is the rate ofchange of this vertical distance righthere the distance between the top of theladder and the ground because if we'resaying how fast is the top of the laddermoving that would also be the same thingas how fast is this distance herechanging so with these latter problemsthe thing that we need to realize isthat we 're dealing with a right triangleso because we have a perfectly verticalwall and we assume that the ground ishorizontal we have a right triangle herewith a 90 degree angle so as a reminderwe 're gon na have our Pythagorean theorema squared plus B squared is equal to Csquared where a and B are the lengths ofthe legs and C is the length of thehypotenuse so if we and it doesn'tmatter which variables we assign but ifwe say that this side is a and this sideis B and then the hypotenuse does haveto be C so if this side is C then we canstart to put together a picture of themoment that we 're interested in soremember we 're interested in how fastthe top of the ladder is moving in otherwords how fast a is changing so the rateat which a changes with respect to timewould be da over DT and the way that wewould get da over DT is by usingimplicit differentiation to take thederivative of this Pythagorean equationso if we took the derivative of thisequation we would say the derivative ofa squared is 2a but then we would haveto multiply it by da over DT becauseremember whenever we use implicitdifferentiation and we take thederivative of a dependent variable wehave to multiply by the rate of changeof that variable with respect to theindependent variable which is time T sothe derivative of a squared is 2a but wehave to multiply by da over DT then wewould say that the derivative of Bsquared is 2 B but we have to multiplyby DB over DT and then the derivative ofC squared is 2 C but we have to multiplyby D C D T so now we can say that we'regonna need to solve for da over DTthat 's the value we 're going to need toget a loan on one side of the equationbut we 're also going to be able to plugin for some other values so let 's seefirst of all what we can plug in for weknow that at the point in time we'reinterested in that a is 9 feet becausehow fast is the top of the ladder movingwhen it 's 9 feet off the ground so we'reinterested in the point in time at whicha is equal to 9 so we could plug 9 infor a and we would say 2 times 9 or wewould get 18 times da over DT then wehave plus 2 B so we have n't been given avalue for B but we do know that at thismoment in time that we 're interested ina a is 9 and C is 41 C is always goingto be 41 because the length of theladder does n't change so if this is 9and this is 41 we can use thePythagorean theorem to solve for a valueof B at that point we would just plug into this formula a squared plus B squaredequals C squared so if a is 9 we wouldget a squared or 9 squared which wouldbe 81 plus B squared B is our unknown isequal to C squared or 41 squared whichis 16 81 if we subtract 81 from bothsides we get B squared equals 1600 andthen if we take the square root of bothsides we can say B is equal toso we can plug 40 in for B we get twotimes 40 or 80 so we 're gon na get plus80 multiplied by DB over DT well this isthe rate of change of B so how fast isthis side changing well we 've been toldthat it 's increasing at four feet persecond because B is getting longer byfour feet per second DB over DT is apositive force we want to multiply thisby a positive four then we have equal totwo times C well we know that C is fortyone so two times forty one gives us 82times DC / DT in other words how fast isC changing with respect to time wellit 's not changing at all because thelength of the ladder is fixed the lengthof side C is fixed it 's not everincreasing or decreasing in length sothe rate of change of C is going to bezero so we plug zero in for DC over DTnow what you notice is it the onlyunknown that remains is this da over DTso we just need to simplify and thenisolate that value by itself so we'regonna get 18 times da over DT plus 80times four is 320 and over on the righthand side we have zero if we subtract320 from both sides we get 18 da over DTis equal to negative 320 if we divideboth sides by 18 we get da over DT isequal to negative 320 divided by 18 wecould reduce this to negative 160 over 9and if we do the decimal approximationwhat we get is da over DT is aboutnegative 17 point 7 and because ourwhole problem is in feet per second wecan call this feet per second so thefact that we get a negative number heretells us that the rate of change of awith respect to time T is negative so ifthe rate of change of a is negative thatmeans this length here a is gettingsmaller over time and of course thatmakes sense because the ladder issliding down the wall which means thatthis distance here is getting smallerand smalleruntil the ladder hits the ground so whatwe can say then is that when the top ofthe ladder is nine feet off the groundthe top of the ladder is falling at arate of 17.7 beat per second RELATED RATES: Ladder sliding down the wall RELATED RATES: Ladder sliding down the wall RELATED RATES: Ladder sliding down the wall
