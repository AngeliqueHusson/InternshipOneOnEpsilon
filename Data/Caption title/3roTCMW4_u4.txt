when we talk about exterior angles andtheir remote interior angles it helps ifwe think about well in English what dothey meanexterior means outside so this is angleone outside of our triangle the anglesthat are inside the triangles are theinterior but there 's only two that ourremote remote means far away which iswhy when you 're trying to use your TVyou use a remote because you 're far awayso the remote interior angles are threeand four so again one is your exteriorangle because it 's outside and the twoangles that are not adjacent to angleone are your remote interior anglesthere 's a special relationship thatexists here and that is angle one isequal to angle three plus angle 4 butyou 're not just gon na take my word forit you 're gon na say mr. McCaul you needto prove that it 's what I 'm gon na do isI 'm gon na say angle 1 and angle 2 mustsum to 180 degrees because if I addthose two angles up we get a straightline the second thing I 'm gon na say isthat these three angles two throughthree two three and four must sum to 180degrees because they make a triangle ifI solve this equation for two I 'm sorrythat two is a little messy then I cansubstitute in to my first equation soI 'm going to subtract angle three andI 'm going to subtract angle four so whatI 'm doing is just moving everything tothe other side of that equation sosubtract angle three subtract angle 4and I find that angle 2 must equal 180minus those two angles so 180 degreesminus angle 3 minus angle 4 so I knowangle 2 in terms of angle 3 and 4 andI 'm going to substitute that in rightover there so we 're a shift and I'mgoing to say angle 1 plus angle 2 whichwe said was 180 minus angle 3 minusangle 4 and if we go back to ouroriginal equation here that has to equal180 degreesI see having 100 80 degrees on bothsides so I 'm just gon na - 180 and thenthat 'll make them disappear and if Imove negatives angle 3 and negativeangle 4 to the other side by addingangle 3 and angle 4 then all I have leftis angle 1 is equal to 180 and negative180 is 0 so we have angle 3 plus angle 4which has proven at the remote exteriorangle excuse me the exterior angle isequal to the sum of the remote interiorangles test
