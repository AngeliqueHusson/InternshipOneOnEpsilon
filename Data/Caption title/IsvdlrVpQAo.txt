okay section 6.5 we 're going to talkabout solving absolute value equationsso remember we talked about absolutevalue a while back okay but rememberwhen you see these vertical bars thatmeans absolute value and what it tellsyou is what 's the distance from zero soif you look at negative two on thenumber linewhat 's that distance from zero you cansee it 's two units when you look at theabsolute value of positive two what'sthat distance from zero it 's two unitsso when we take the absolute value italways gives us a positive result overhere but what we 're really looking atwhat is what is the distance from zeroso let 's look at an example here andI 'll show you how it works so the firstthing is to isolate or get that absolutevalue quantity by itself so what I'mgoing to do is I 'm going to work fromthe outside in I 'm going to subtract 2from both sides that way those cancel sothat gives us 12 and here I 'm going todivide both sides by 3 ok because we'retrying to get that absolute valuequantity by itself now what thisrepresents here sea- means thedifference and difference means thedistance okay in geometry so thedistance between some number and 4 is 4units so if you think about this on thenumber line here 's um here 's 4 and thedistance between some number and 4 is 4units so it means it could be 4 units tothe right it could be 4 units to theleft so you can see that the answer isgoing to be either 0 or it 's going to be8 and you can double check that see zerominus 4 is negative 4 when we take theabsolute value makes a positive 4 if wedo 8 minus 4 that 's 4 the absolute valueof 4 is still 4 it always gives us apositive result now if I was going tosolve this I would n't do itgeometrically like that I would just dothe algebra method I would say X minus 4equals 4 what you want to do is you wantto split this up into two equations Xminus 4 is equal to positive 4 or Xminus 4 is equal to negative 4 then youjust add 4 to both sides we get x equals8 add 4 to both sides we get x equals 0so that 's the key is you want to splitit up into two equations one with thepositive scenario one with the negativescenario because remember whatever wasin here originally if it was negativewhen we take the absolute values canmake it positive so we consider bothcases I 'll show you some examplessay for example this one here theabsolute value of 2x minus three isequal to negative twowell this one 's actually a trickquestion and I put this in here onpurpose because sometimes you 'll seethis when we take the absolute valueremember how we talked about how we canall it always has to be positive you cannever have a negative value when youtake the absolute value so this one isactually no solution and I wanted toshow you that in case you ever seesomething like that so now number twolet 's do this one so this one what we'regoing to do is we 're going to split itup into two equations X plus five equalsthree or X plus five equals negativethree all we have to do is solve theseinit equations you know separately sothat 's x equals negative 2 or subtract 5from both sides here we get x equals anegative 8 and I 'm just going to put theor in between so x equals negative 2 orx equals negative 8 now the nice thingabout algebra is you can check youranswer you put it back in negative 2plus 5 is 3 f 0 3 is 3 negative 8 plus 5is negative 3 absolute value negative 3still gives us positive 3 but the key isto want to learn algebra 1 check out mylearn algebra 1 video course for salewhere we go through 87 video lessonsthat take you step by step by stepthrough algebra 1 we talk about theimportant concepts formulas and we gothrough numerous example problemstogether to help you learn algebra 1click the interactive card or the linkin the description below to take youover there to get started with some ofthe free lessons in the meantime let'scontinue on with this video 2 3 but thekey is to split it up into two equationsand consider the positive case in thenegative case see if you can do number 3and number 4 on your own we 'll gothrough them here together so again ourgoal is to get that part an absolutevalue by itself so I 'm going to workfrom the outside in by doing theopposite operation ok so subtracting 2from both sides now I 'm going tomultiply both sides by negative 1 sothat 's going to give you X minus 4equals positive 9 now I 'm going to splitit up into two equations X minus 4equals 9 or X minus 4 equals theopposite of 9 add 4 to both sides we get13 add 4 to both sides we get negative 5and those are our two solutions andagain you can plug them back in andcheck let 's look at number 4 see if wecan do this one on your ownagain working from the outside in tryingto get that absolute value portion byitself okay on one side of the equationI 'm gon na do the opposite of multiplyingby five I 'm gon na divide by five so 25divided by 5 is 5x minus 10 now we splitit up into two equations right X minus10 equals 5 or X minus 10 equalsnegative 5 add 10 to both sides we get15 add 10 to both sides we get 5 andyou 've got it so one last problem herein this section we 're gon na do a wordproblem of course we got to get good ourstory problems you want to set up abasketball hoop at a height of 10 feetwith an absolute deviation of 0.25inches okay write an absolute valueequation to model the situation andsolve ok so let me just show you aformula it 's gon na be really helpful foryou it 's this one right here thisabsolute deviation equation ax is yourvariable - your target value that 's whatyou 're aiming for that difference okayis the deviation so deviation means howfar off are you like you could be alittle bit higher the basketball hoopcould be little bit higher or it couldbe a little bit lower but you do n't wantit to be higher by more than 0.25 inchesyou do n't want to be lower you know bymore than 0.25 inches so if we 're gonnawrite this we 're gon na say I 'll just useH for height so the actual height - ourtarget height which is 10 feet I 'm goingto convert that to inches that 's 120inches is equal to the deviation wedo n't want we want it to be we want itnot to be off by more than 0.25 but inthis case we 're just gon na set it equalto 0.25 to figure out what the maximumheight the hoop could be at and then theminimum height okay so that 's it so it'sour variable - our target value equalsour deviation now the reason I convertedthis to inches is because this was ininches and I wanted these units to bethe same okay so now let 's just solveour two equations X - H - 1 xx equals0.25 or H - 1 xx equals negative 0.25I 'm going to add 120 to both sides so weget H equals 120 0.25 add 122sides here and we get 119.7 fiveit 's a story problem so we would reallywant to write a sentence I would saysomething like the maximum height of thebasketball who could be 10 feet and 1/4of an inch or louis it could be would beha ha you know 119.7 5 inches so I wouldwrite a sentence put your units in therethat 's the key but again memorize thisform know this is helpful X minus thetarget value the absolute value is equalyour deviation that means how far offyou are so great lesson I 'll see you inthe next section and we 'll continue onfrom there test
