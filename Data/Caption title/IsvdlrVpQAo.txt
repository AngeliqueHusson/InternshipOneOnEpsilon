section going talk absolute value remember tal ked absolute value back remember see vertical bar absolute value whats distance zero look negative two line whats distance zero see two look absolute value positive two whats distance zero two take absolute value always give us positive result really looking distance zero let look example show works first thing isolate get absolute value quantity going work outside going subtract sides way cancel give us going divide sides k trying get absolute value quantity sea mean difference difference mean distance geometry distance number think line um distance number mean could right could left see answer going either going double check see zero minus negative take absolute value make positive minus thats absolute value still always give us positive result going solve wouldnt geometrically like would algebra method would say x minus want want split two equation x minus equal positive x minus equal negative add sides get x add sides get x equal thats key want split two equation one positive scenario one negative scenario remember whatever originally negative take absolute value make positive consider ill show example one absolute value minus three equal negative two well actually trick question put purpose sometimes see take absolute value remember tal ked always positive never negative value take absolute value one actually solution wan ted case ever see something like number one one going going split two equation x plus five x plus five equal negative three solve equation know separately thats x equal negative subtract sides get x equal negative going put x equal negative x equal negative nice thing algebra check answer put back negative f negative plus negative absolute value negative give us positive key want learn algebra check learn algebra video course sale go video take step step step algebra talk important concept formula go numerous example help learn algebra interactive card description take get star ted free mean time video key split two equation sand consider positive case negative case see number number well go together goal get part absolute value going work outside opposite operation k subtract ing sides going multiply sides negative thats going give x minus positive going split two equation x minus x minus equal opposite add sides add sides get negative two solution plug back check let look number see one working outside trying get absolute value portion one side gon na opposite multiplying five gon na divide five minus split two equation right x equal x minus add sides add sides get youve got one last problem herein section gon na word problem course got get good problem want set basketball hoop height absolute deviation write absolute value equation model situation solve k let show formula gon na really helpful one right absolute deviation equation ax variable target value thats aiming difference oka yis deviation deviation mean far like could little bit higher basketball hoop could little bit higher could little bit lower dont higher dont want lower know inch es gon na say ill height actual height target height fee going convert inch es thats equal deviation dont want want want case gon na set equal figure maximum height hoop could minimum height thats variable target value equal sour deviation reason converted inch es wan ted let solve two equation x h x x h x x equal negative going add sides get h equal add get five story problem would really want write sentence would say something like maximum height basketball could fee inch could would ha ha know inch es would write sentence put thats key memorize form know helpful x minus target value absolute value equal deviation mean far great lesson ill see next section well continue absolute value equation solve learn algebra absolute value equation solve learn algebra absolute value equation solve learn algebra absolute value equation solve learn algebra absolute value equation solve learn algebra absolute value equation solve learn algebra absolute value equation solve learn algebra absolute value equation solve learn algebra absolute value equation solve learn algebra absolute value equation solve learn algebra absolute value equation solve learn algebra absolute value equation solve learn algebra absolute value equation solve learn algebra absolute value equation solve learn algebra absolute value equation solve learn algebra absolute value equation solve learn algebra absolute value equation solve learn algebra absolute value equation solve learn algebra absolute value equation solve learn algebra absolute value equation solve learn algebra absolute value equation solve learn algebra absolute value equation solve learn algebra absolute value equation solve learn algebra absolute value equation solve learn algebra absolute value equation solve learn algebra
