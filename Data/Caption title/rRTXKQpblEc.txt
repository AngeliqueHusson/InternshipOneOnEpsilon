voice know find area rectangle multiplying base times height area rectangle equal base times another video saw looking area parallelogram also know length base know height area still going base times height obvious parallelogram video little manipulation said hey let take little section right took little section right move right hand side like see long base height rectangle able construct rectangle moving area thats area parallelogram base times didnt add take away area area left hand side right hand side show area parallelogram area rectangle still going base times height hopefully convince area parallelogram base times height going use get intuition area triangle let look triangle triangle given base height gon na try think whats area triangle going imagine going dependent base height well think let copy paste triangle let copy let paste gon na two going twice area gon na rotate gon na rotate around like add original area see something interesting happening parallelogram parallelogram twice area original triangle cause two original saw copied pasted parallelogram interesting well area entire parallelogram area entire parallelogram going length base times height also height written h upside going base times height thats going parallelogram entire let draw parallelogram right thats going area entire parallelogram would area original triangle would area original triangle well already saw area parallelogram twice area original triangle original triangle going half area area right going one half area parallelogram one half base let colors one half base times half base times height might say k maybe worked triangle wan na see work triangle sand help added another triangle right could obtuse triangle angle right greater gon na trick base think start point right drop ball length ball goes string hereto kind get ground level could view ground level right thats going height sitting triangle like saw last time still height triangle building kind youd say well far ground well whats area going well imagine going one half base times feel good well let magic let copy paste gon na copy paste whoops didnt work let copy paste two triangle gon na flip one construct parallelogram gon na flip move reim gon na rotate little bit think get general idea parallelogram twice area original triangle twice area original triangle tal ked area entire parallelogram would base times height parallelogram base times height parallelogram talking area talking original triangle going half area parallelogram gon na one half area original triangle one half base times height hopefully make feel pretty good formula see geometry area triangle one half base times height area rectangle going base times height area triangle intuition algebra high school math khan academy area triangle intuition algebra high school math khan academy area triangle intuition algebra high school math khan academy area triangle intuition algebra high school math khan academy area triangle intuition algebra high school math khan academy area triangle intuition algebra high school math khan academy area triangle intuition algebra high school math khan academy area triangle intuition algebra high school math khan academy area triangle intuition algebra high school math khan academy area triangle intuition algebra high school math khan academy area triangle intuition algebra high school math khan academy
