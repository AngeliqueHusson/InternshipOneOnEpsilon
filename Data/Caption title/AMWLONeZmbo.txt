so welcome to my video on convertingdegrees into radians and also convertingradians to degrees and when talkingabout an angle most people know that youcan express an angle in the unit ofdegrees but many people do n't know thatyou can also express an angle in a unitthat we call radians and in this videoI 'm not going to explain to you what aRadian actually is or how we came upwith that unit I 'll make a separatevideo for that that I 'll post a link forbut in this video just to save you alittle bit of time I 'm just going tostrictly focus on converting fromdegrees to radians and from radians todegrees so in order to convert the onlything that you need to know is that 180degrees is exactly equal to an angle ofPI radians alright that 's the only thingthat we need to know so let 's getstarted by with an example let 's saythat we have sorry about that let 's saywe have an angle of 60 degrees and wewant to convert this angle of 60 degreesand we want to convert it into radiansand anytime I do any type of conversionI always make what I like to call aconversion tool and this conversion toolis just a big parentheses with thefraction and in the denominator of thefraction you always have the same unitsthat you start with since we 're startingwith degrees then we know that in thedenominator we also have to have degreesand in the numerator of our conversiontool we always have to have the unit'sthat we 're going to end with since we'resince we 're going from degrees intoradians that means that we have to haveradians in the numerator since that'swhat we 're going to end with also in theconversion tool the numerator and thedenominator have to be exactly equalalways so we know that 180 degrees isexactly equal to pi radians and once wedo that now we are ready to officiallyI 'm convert so let 's simplify this asmuch as possible notice how the degreescancel out and we 're left with 60 timespi so I 'll just write that as 60 PI andin the denominator we have a 180 and wealso have a radians in the numerator sonow we 've actually converted fromdegrees into radians this is 60 degreesis equal to 60 PI over 180 radians whatthis needs to be simplified even furtherwe know that 60 over 180 is equal to onethird so you can so this is actually 1/3PI or you can say PI over 3 radians sonow we have officially converted fromdegrees to radians 60 degrees is equalto PI over 3 radians so now let 's goover an example from going from radiansto degrees all right so let 's say thatwe have an angle of 5 PI over 3 radiansand we need to convert this into degreesand once again I 'm going to make myconversion tool parentheses just with afraction and in the denominator of thefraction you always have to have thesame units that we 're starting withsince we 're starting with radians thenwe have to have radians in thedenominator and in the numerator we haveto have the units that we 're ending withsince we 're going to degrees we need tohave degrees in the numeratoronce again the numerator and thedenominator have to be exactly equal andwe know that 180 degrees is equal to PIradians and now we 're ready to convertnotice how the radians cancel out wealso have a PI that cancels out and weare left with 5 over 3 in the front andthat is multiplied by 180 degreesso now that we 've converted into degreeswe just need to simplify this as much aspossible and you can multiply 5 over 3times 180 by typing this into yourcalculator or you can cross multiply ifwe cross multiply this 3 becomes 1 andthe 180 becomes a 60 and the only thingwe 're left with is 5 times 60 which is300 and instead of writing degrees withthe letters deg I 'm just going to usethe degree symbol which is which is justa little dot so we know that 5 PI over 3radians is equal to 300 degrees so Ihope this gave you a better idea on howto convert radians and degrees Iactually hope that this gave you abetter idea of just how to convert anyunits in general I hope you enjoyed thisvideo and I will see you in my next one test
