hello my name is Maria Miller from mathmom of calm in this lesson we 're gonnastudy mean median and mode the measuresof central tendency of a distributionokay and my first example is aboutscience grades of a class let 's say thatwe have so many students and here areall of the grades written out what theygot and here is the distribution done asa dot plot so each dot corresponds toone student one student got a D okay sojust looking at the distribution herelooking at the plot we can see that thebulk of the students seem to be gettingC C plus something like that and thesethree measures of central tendencyshould give us information about thecenter of the distribution about thebulk of the students okay what 's averagehow did the average student do so tospeak okaynow mean is the regular average which iscalculated by adding all of the valuestogether and dividing by how manyobservations there are in this case wecannot calculate the mean because youcannot start adding something that 's notnumbers these are not numbers you cannotadd them so mean it 's not available wecannot calculate median is the middlemost number once you have organized yourdata from smallest to greatest and thisdata can be organized this is definitelythe least and this is the greatest it'sorganized in order so now we can checkwhat is the middle most item there amiddle most value first I need to counthow many values there are 12 13 14 15 1617 18 19there are 19 values and now half of 19you need to think of this being dividedinto two groups it would be like ten andnine right but let 's think of it thisway if you take nine of them to the onegroup and nine of them to the otherthat 's 18 and then whatever is leftmiddle is the middlemost observation soI count nine from here and then thetenth observation tenth value here isthe median c-plus so medium is c-plusokay and that describes the centraltendency or the middle of thisdistribution pretty good mode is theitem that occurs most often and if Ijust I have to look at the list here orlook at what is highest here it is C sothat also describes this distributionwell both median and mode are doing goodso to speak okay they are helpful inthis example we have favorite colors ofpeople and this would be the number ofpeople so maybe let 's say 200 peoplesaid that black was the favorite color770 people said that blue was thefavorite color and so on okay now can wecalculate the mean the median the modecan we calculate the dose it is sohappens that even though there arenumbers associated like I said maybethere was 200 people who said blackmaybe there was 777 people that saidblue we can not calculate anything fromthis data because think about what kindof list of data what kind of list ofvalues was used to make this plot tomake this bar graph it was n't numbersit was people 's responses to thequestion what 's your favorite color sothe responses would have been justindividual words you know black blackblue blue blue blue orange blue blueblue pink you know that 's the list ofvalues that was used to make this bargraph and if you have a list of wordslike black blue pink pink you can not putthem in order to find the median and youcannot add them and divide anything youcannot calculate the mean either theonly thing we can find is the mode whatis the most common what is the valueoccurring most often blue that 's all youcan do herehere these numbers are shootingpercentages okay or field goalpercentages if you wan na think of themthat way our basketball players they arethis sort of basic percentages like 12 % 13 % just to keep it simple and now let'sfind out mean median and mode here isthe distribution as a histogram thiskind of bar graph where the bars aretouching each other is called ahistogram and here is my beam so tospeak for 12 to 15 % there 's threeplayers here okay and 16 to 19 percentthere was one player and so on we cansee from the graph already that thecenter of this distribution is somewherehere right okayto calculate the mode might be easiestjust check the list and check whatnumber occurs most often there 's 23 butthere 's also 25 this state has two modesokay so the mode is 23 and 25 becauseboth of them occur twice as often okaymedian is the middle most number let'scheck that now there 's 1 2 3 4 5 6 14players and so the middle most number isnow not going to be a single numberbecause when I divide this data set inhalf I get 7 and 7 so I will look at the7th and 8th value there and take theiraverage it 's the 7 is the 8th value ifyou take basically their midpoint or theaverage it is going to be 23 median is23 and then the mean now we cancalculate to me it is the sum of allvalues divided by the numberof all that is okay also sometimescalled the average and I calculated theSun before this video it was 319 and wehave 14 players there and so 319 dividedby 14 you calculate that and you getabout22.8 so that is the means now this it'spretty close to medium and both mean andmedian are describing this distributionwell because both of them are somewherehere lastly here we are not gonnacalculate anything but I want to showyou this graph this is a distributiontypical distribution if you 're studyingincome of people most anywhere itdoes n't even have to be dollars it couldbe some other unit basis whatever andthis would be the number of people sobasically there 's lots of people whoearn low income even more people whoearn some kind of middle income orwhatever then it starts tapering downand there 's less and less than peopleearning high incomes and then there is atrickle of people earning very highincomes okay and when you calculate meanmedian and mode now mode not it 's notreally necessarily useful here becausepeople 's incomes might vary there mightbe somebody earning let 's say thirty sixthousand two hundred and somebody elseearning thirty six thousand two hundredtwenty their clothes numbers but as asfar as mode goes they 're still not thesame number so we would n't use mode inthis kind of situation usually but meanand median are possible to calculate andwhat happens in this kind of a shape isthat the media might be somewhere hereokay and the mean gets to be more okaythat is because the mean is affected somuch by these big numbers coming fromhere even though they are few there'sonly a few people earning big dollarsokay so to speak they affect theme so the median might be here the meanalways gets to be some more the medianis the better measure of the centraltendency of this distribution here okayit follows more closely near nearer tothe peak whereas the mean gets kind ofthrown off by all these big numbers fromhere because you 're adding the numbersall together you 're adding everybody'sincomes together dividing by the numberof all values or number the people andso mean gets affected if there are evensome very big numbers here to be addedto the whole stuff okay we 're all doneand I hope this was helpful test
