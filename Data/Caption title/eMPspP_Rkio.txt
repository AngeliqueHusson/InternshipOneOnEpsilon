hello name maria miller calm lesson mean median mode central tendency first example science class let say many student written got distribution done dot plot dot correspond student one student got looking distribution looking plot see bulk student seem getting c c plus something like three measure central tendency give us information center distribution bulk student average average student speak mean regular average calculated dividing case can not calculate mean can not start something can not add mean available can not calculate median middlemost number organized data data organized definitely least organized order check middle item middle value first need count many value value half need think divided two group would like ten nine right let think way take nine one group nine whatever left middle middlemost observation count nine tenth observation tenth value median c plus medium describe central tendency middle distribution pretty good mode item occur often look list look highest c also describe distribution well median mode speak helpful example favorite colors people would number people maybe let say people said black favorite people said blue favorite color calculate mean median calculate dose even though associated like said maybe people said black maybe people said blue calculate anything data think kind list data kind list used make plot make bar graph n number sit people response question favorite color response would individual word know black black blue blue blue blue orange blue blue blue pink know list used make bar graph list black blue pink pink order find median can not add divide anything can not calculate mean either thing find mode common often blue field wan na think way basketball sort basic percentage like keep simple mean median mode distribution histogram kind bar graph bar cal led histogram beam speak percent one player see graph already center distribution somewhere right calculate mode might easiest check list check number occur often also state two mode occur twice often middle number middle number going single number divide data set half get look value take average value take basically mid point going median mean calculate sum divided number also sometime scalled average calculated sun video divided calculate mean pretty close medium mean median de scribing distribution well somewhere lastly anything want show graph distribution typical distribution people anywhere n even dollar could unit basis whatever would number people basically lots people earn low income even people earn kind middle income whatever start tapering less less people earning high atrickle people earning calculate mean median mode mode really necessarily useful people might vary might somebody earning let say thirty six thousand two hundred somebody else earning thirty six thousand two hundred twenty clothes far mode goes still number would n use mode kind situation usually mean median possible calculate happen kind shape media might somewhere mean get mean affected much big coming even though people earning big speak affect theme median might mean always get median better measure central tendency distribution follow closely near near er peak whereas mean get kind thrown big together together dividing number value number people mean get affected even big added whole stuff done hope helpful mean median mode measure central tendency mean median mode measure central tendency mean median mode measure central tendency mean median mode measure central tendency mean median mode measure central tendency mean median mode measure central tendency mean median mode measure central tendency mean median mode measure central tendency mean median mode measure central tendency mean median mode measure central tendency mean median mode measure central tendency mean median mode measure central tendency
