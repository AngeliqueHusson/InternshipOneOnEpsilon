video ill show find horizontal also vertical function first horizontal acid hope remember take two first one limit x approach es positive infinity function finite valued right finite value horizontal slope also work limit x infinity function value might different also finite another horizontal slope example like inverse tangent x two different horizontal tops course two file could case still one limit dont exist limit like infinity negative infinity dont horizontal stoke going work first let get going first take limit x infinity function x squared plus x minus notice one really nice polynomial another polynomial take limit approaching infinity x approaching infinity compare highest power x top highest power x bottom limit x approach es passe team finity top bottom x squared remember x approaching infinity negative infinity right purpose trying compare ratio top bottom part top part bottom case cancel one saying limit x approach es infinity get x plugging infinity notice none infinity finite number infinity get conclusion right case see finite equal one horizontal obstacle different anyway thats pretty much part part thing limit x approach es negative infinity function course still thing right x approaching negative infinity top care x bottom care x squared trying compare part also bottom limit x approach es negative infinity x square know guy pretty much cancel thing get limit x infinity x plug negative infinity get negative infinity right even though positive negative infinity still want put negative thats still notice equal mean one horizontal acetal equal right right talk find vertical asymptote sand situation function like want worry us noun serious situation top zero like well sometimes may end zero zero case might open circle graph namely discontinuity non zero zero situation function vertical stop set going worry bottom find candidate particular slope mean set x squared plus x minus set zero solve factor ing get x plus times x minus first part see x plus x negative part see x minus tobe mean x point two going make denominator get rid domain talking vertical sort situation pay attention make sure top can not mean let demonstrate plug negative original right original see non zero zero situation let check plugging negative get negative minus zero know plug negative zero thing theta right see top times negative negative minus negative rota already half know condition yes vertical asset hope negative ill put right right check hand though plug original function see thats going times minus know already thought top seeing times minus rule already situation actually dont asset little bit investigation investigation take limit x approach es function see minus x squared plus x minus limit know plug x simplify expression see top x minus bottom factor get x plus times x minus course see x minus get limit x approach es x plus plug get plus namely get right tell x approaching value approaching x exactly function actually undefined mean open circle x right actually removable discontinuity right see open circle nice graph theres open circle theres left rudder right removable theres continuity right continuity like movable jump even though open circle anyway vertical though sure kind check write right call us hope write formula x equal x equal negative addition question removable discontinuity tell every movable removable removable continuity right add x equal yeah thats answer question also anyway vertical asymptote v removable discontinuity vertical asymptote v removable discontinuity vertical asymptote v removable discontinuity vertical asymptote v removable discontinuity vertical asymptote v removable discontinuity vertical asymptote v removable discontinuity vertical asymptote v removable discontinuity vertical asymptote v removable discontinuity vertical asymptote v removable discontinuity vertical asymptote v removable discontinuity vertical asymptote v removable discontinuity vertical asymptote v removable discontinuity vertical asymptote v removable discontinuity vertical asymptote v removable discontinuity vertical asymptote v removable discontinuity vertical asymptote v removable discontinuity vertical asymptote v removable discontinuity vertical asymptote v removable discontinuity vertical asymptote v removable discontinuity vertical asymptote v removable discontinuity vertical asymptote v removable discontinuity vertical asymptote v removable discontinuity vertical asymptote v removable discontinuity vertical asymptote v removable discontinuity vertical asymptote v removable discontinuity vertical asymptote v removable discontinuity vertical asymptote v removable discontinuity
