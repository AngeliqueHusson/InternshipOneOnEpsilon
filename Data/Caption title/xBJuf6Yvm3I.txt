okay so welcome to my video on negativenumbers and I 'm guessing that if you'rewatching this video that you 're probablyalready familiar with positive numbersand where positive numbers go on thisnumber line and if you do n't know allpositive numbers go to the right of thenumber zero so if we start to the rightof the number zero we can start with thepositive number one positive number twoand this goes on for as far as you wouldlike I 'm going to stop at the number sixbut all positive numbers go to the rightof zero and negative numbers you canprobably figure this out go to the leftof the number zero so starting to theleft of zero we start with negative onenegative two negative three and you cango as far as you would like and I'mgoing to stop at negative six so allnegative numbers go to the left of zeroand you could probably figure out thatthat the farther right you go on thenumber line the larger the number solet 's take a look at the number six andthe number two okay six is obviouslylarger than two six is larger than twonow that 's because six is farther to theright the more right you go the largerthe number so let 's take a look at thenumber negative six and negative two thefarther left you go the smaller thenumber so since negative six is fartherto the left and negative two andnegative six is smaller or less thannegative two negative six is less thannegative two the farther left you go onthe number line the smaller the numberso it 's an important idea to remember orto know before we get started withadding and subtracting negative numbersso having said that let 's get startedright away on some examples so let'sstart off with an easy example let 's saywe have positive 2 minus 4 positive 2minus 4 so we 're starting with a numberpositive 2 and I 'm going to circle inblack where we 're starting and noticehow we are subtracting 4 if we subtractthat means we need to go to the left sowe need to go to the left 4 units so ifwe count 1 2 3 4 we finish at negative 2and I 'll circle that in red so 2 minus 4is equal to negative 2 that 's our finalanswerlet 's go over another example so let'ssay we have negative 2 plus a negative 4and the first thing I want to point outis notice how we have a plus sign and wehave a minus sign right next to eachother we have plus a negative 4 apositive and a negative are the samething as a minus sign so that'ssomething you need to remember apositive and a negative together are thesame thing as a minus sign so you couldsay negative 2 minus 4 instead of plusnegative 4 it 's the same thing negative2 minus 4 is the same as plus negative 4okay so we 're starting at negative 2 soI 'll circle where we start in black andwe are subtracting 4 so that means we'regoing to the left 4 units so if we count1 2 3 4 we finish at negative 6 sonegative 2 minus 4 is equal to negative6 or you could say negative 2 plusnegative 4 is also equal to negative 6so let 's go over another example solet 's say that we have negative 2 minusa negative for so the first thing I wantto point out is notice that we have twonegative signs directly next to eachother two negatives can be written withone positive this is also something thatyou need to remember two negatives arethe same as a plus sign so you could saynegative two plus four instead of minusnegative four it 's the same thingnegative two plus four is the same asnegative two minus negative four so ifwe start at negative two and since we'readding four that means we need to go tothe right four units I 'm going to countone two three four units to the rightand we finish at positive two so youcould say negative two plus four isequal to positive two or you could saynegative two minus negative four is alsoequal to positive two so I hope thisvideo gave you a better idea of addingand subtracting negative numbers in mynext video I 'm going to go overmultiplying and dividing and negativenumbers so stay tuned I hope you'reenjoying these and I will see you in mynext one test
