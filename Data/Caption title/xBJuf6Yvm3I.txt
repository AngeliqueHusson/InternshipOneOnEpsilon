welcome video guessing video probably already familiar positive number sand positive go line dont know positive go right zero start number zero start positive number one positive number two goes far would like going stop number six positive go zero negative probably figure go left number zero starting left zero start negative one negative two negative three far would like stop negative six negative go left zero could probably figure farther right go line number take look number six number two six two six two thats six farther right right go number let take look negative six negative two farther left go smaller since negative six farther left negative two negative six smaller less negative two negative six less negative two farther left go number line smaller number important idea remember know get star ted subtract ing negative said let get away example easy example let say positive minus positive starting number positive going circle black starting notice subtract ing subtract mean need go left need go left count finish negative ill circle red minus equal negative thats go another example negative plus negative first thing want point notice plus sign minus sign right next plus negative positive negative thing minus sign thats something need remember positive negative together thing minus sign could say negative minus instead plus negative thing minus plus negative starting negative circle start black subtract ing mean going left finish negative negative minus equal could say negative plus negative also equal negative let go another example say negative minus negative first thing want point notice two negative sign directly next two negative written positive also something need remember two negative plus sign could say negative two plus four instead minus negative four thing negative two plus four negative two minus negative four start negative two since four mean need go right four going count one two three four right finish positive two could say negative two plus four equal positive two could say negative two minus negative four also equal positive two hope video gave better idea subtract ing negative next video going go dividing stay tuned hope see next one subtract ing negative subtract ing negative subtract ing negative subtract ing negative subtract ing negative subtract ing negative subtract ing negative subtract ing negative subtract ing negative subtract ing negative subtract ing negative subtract ing negative
