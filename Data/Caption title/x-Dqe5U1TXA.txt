What is the place value of 3 in 654.213 ? So let 's think about that a little bit.And to do that , let me rewrite the number , and I 'll writeeach digit in a different color.So we have 654 point -- we get the decimal point -- 213.Now we 're pretty familiar , I think , with what goes on tothe left of the decimal point.We know that this right here -- let me do this in a neutralcolor -- is the hundreds place , or we could view that as 10 tothe second.Let me write that a little bit bigger down here.So this right here that is the hundreds place , or you couldview that as the 10 to the second 's place , which is thesame thing as hundred.This right here is the tens place , which is the same thingas 10 to the first . This right here is the ones place , whichis the same thing as 10 to the zero.Then if you go one place to the right of the decimalpoint , this represents tenths.This represents tenths , or we could view it as 10 to thenegative one.Then , if we go to this magenta , if we go two placesto the right , this represents hundredths , or 10 to thenegative two.And then finally , this 3 represents thousandths.This represents thousandths , or 10 to the negative three.Now , just to answer the question what is the placevalue of 3 in 654.213 ? The place value is thousandths.That would essentially answer their question.But to make sure that we really understand what thismeans , I 'm going to rewrite this number.We can rewrite this number as 600.We have 6 hundreds plus 5 tens , or you could say plus 50plus 4 ones plus 2/10 , plus 1/100 , plus 3/1,000.Or we could write this , just to really make sure weunderstand what we 're talking about when we mean placevalue , we can rewrite this number as 6 times 100 , plus 5times 10 , plus 4 times 1 -- I keep doing that in the wrongcolor -- plus 2 times 1/10 , plus 1 times 1/100 , and thenfinally , plus 3 times 1/1,000.So hopefully , when you write it out like this , it gives youa sense of what it means we say place value.The 6 , three digits to the left of the decimal , is in thehundreds place , so it represents 6 hundreds.This represents 5 tens because it 's in the tens place.This represents 4 ones.You go to the thousandths place , this 3 literallyrepresents three one-thousandths .
