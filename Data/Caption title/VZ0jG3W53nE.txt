hi rob welcome math antic sin video going talk really important math concept cal led distributive property least cal led sometimes may hear refer red distributive law even distributive property multiplication addition people want sound really technical matter cal led concept distributive property actually dive concept two quick thing help make easier understand first simply knowing word distribute distribute something mean give member old fashioned paper boy deliver ing newspaper house neighborhood one oh gee sorry one one second thing need know order operation rule arithmetic cover another video might want watch familiar rule already distributive property actually way us change order operation certain type see mean look simple arithmetic expression three times group plus going simplify expression two different ways first way use basic order operation rule already know second way use distributive property arithmetic right ways give us answer first way order operation rule tell us need operation inside group since parentheses form group first need add give us multiply give us final answer let use distributive property distributive property allow us change expression different multiplying whole group distribute factor multiply member group individually mean make copy times member apply ing distributive property expression look like times plus times distributed multiplication member group group parentheses go away continue simplify new form order operation rule tell us multiplication addition times times last step add two result together look got answer mean original expression equivalent even though different form sin first form factor entire group addition inside group first second form used distributive property rearrange expression factor member group individually instead whole group factor made group go away addition inside group first distributive property basically way getting rid group factor distribute factor member group get answer would calculate group first multiply works matter many member group like problem multiply group let try simplify ing first way start simplify ing group multiply times give us let use distributive property distribute factor member group make group go away allow us multiplication times times times add three individual plus plus distributive property gave us another way arrive answer like distributive property alternate path take arrive point oh always great two ways get answer need two different ways calculation like distributive property way even complicated regular way would ever want use good question true times distributive property way harder first problem easier go ahead simplify group first easy multiply times also times distributive property way case times group decide simplify group first problem end needing multiply times easy mentally apply distributive property instead change expression plus easier times times answer distributive property make calculation easier mentally come really handy certain basic multiplication break factor group sum like expanded distribute factor member say need multiply times could use multiplication procedure could change problem distributive property make little easier key realize replace plus problem becomes times group distributive property let us change times plus times two multiplication easy times times answer plus see another example let apply idea multiplication problem times instead let change group need multiply distributive property let us distribute multiplication member help times times times left add three product hard mentally give us final answer wrap one important thing know distributive property already know distributive property works member group added works way member group problem times group could problem typical way simplify group minus times give us use distributive property distribute times member group times minus times times equal times minus equal ways equivalent distributive property works group size works group member added mixture addition subtraction group distributive property work member group divided example times group distribute copy factor member group without getting completely different answer goes division member group divided like times group get right answer distribute factor member technical name distributive property multiplication addition multiplication member group added reason also works subtraction subtraction really negative form addition since subtraction addition inverse distributive property handy way rearrange arithmetic expression sit like tool use certain situation think make particular calculation easier even end distributive property whole lot arithmetic problem sit still really important math concept even useful get algebra sure practice learned video trying exercise best way make sure really understand always thanks watching math antic see ya next time learn distributive property arithmetic distributive property arithmetic
