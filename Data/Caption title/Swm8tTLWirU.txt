passing another video throw dart real number line chance hit ting rational number exactly zero theres trick dart guarantee land line infinite number rational number line waiting hit rational flooding every crevice two rational every possible ratio one integer another many yeah dart wont hit actually written nice simple finite number nonzero infinite rational digit severy rational number section infinitely sometimes sometimes single digit sometimes many section may get longer farther get fraction make set rational number equal amount thing course times number infinitely finite information repeat many infinite sequence make real number repeat irrational could make random irrational number starting rolling die infinite number times chance getting exactly pi wan ted rational number ended like long could expect keep rolling fair die doesnt matter lucky literally roll infinite times chance zero exactly eventually roll something else even go back three eventually roll something else rational imagine rolling dice getting sequence every time roll long would realistically expect last forever ever infinite chance course chance getting chance getting particular number chance getting particular number exactly zero hit number call question process pick random real number cant actually define real number series random dice roll math randomness general single infinite random would infinite information doesnt fit universe get transcendental let talk algebraic algebraic definition defined algebra spoiler alert cant example every rational number defined finite combination digit sa division sign another finite combination throw minus sign first symbol mix also use symbol get irrational irrational defined simply couple algebraic algebraic symbol like phi golden ratio exactly defined part unsolved equation theres algebraic way solve x approximate dont care solve x long fully define way totally crazy make algebraic equation algebra cant solve also entirely inevitable hint theres much cooler math algebra totally list number possible combination algebraic symbol starting combination symbol listing valid combination symbol arbitrarily large finite number lot combination arent valid equal ear lier dont need go list since list possible algebraic match theres exactly many aleph null also match es trying list decimal together combination something lot people response proof process get number swell get possible finite combination nothing infinite irrational rational either since rational number send infinitely series number correspondence unless make function exactly unique entry list correspond pi constant answer cant get irrational infinity first thats whole number second thats one one yeah probably one one number correspondence simple list possible combination algebraic symbol list never get would take infinite amount symbol define listing combination never get infinite nonalgebraic transcend algebra even infinite way define list never get maybe theres way approach given transcendental number pattern make sense like pi e idea define whether defined hit random real number dart dont even know look result differentiate around dart give result decimal finite amount tell number dart report back algebraic theres chance youve hit number defined finite amount algebraic uncountably infinite set transcendental real people know pi e maybe like constant else transcendental well maybe one reason people dont know transcendental many transcendental field mathematics little slow prove whether transcendental theres lots open question transcendence theory like dont even know whether constant irrational much less transcendental super embarrassing maybe rational maybe tomorrow someone come algebraic equation maybe someone prove cant prove whether prove transcendental mean kind thing think people problem cantor diagonal proof actually problem real idea defined arbitrary combination infinite infinite information yeah thats pretty weird whoever decided call real didnt think one thanks lot transcendental darts transcendental darts transcendental darts transcendental darts transcendental darts transcendental darts transcendental
