What I want to do in this video isgive an overview of quadrilaterals.And you can imagine , from this prefix , or , I guess you could say , the beginning of this word , quad -- this involves four of something.And quadrilaterals , as you can imagine , are shapes.And we 're going to be talking about two-dimensional shapesthat have four sides and four vertices and four angles.So , for example -- one , two , three , four.That is a quadrilateral , although that last sidedid n't look too straight.One , two , three , four.That is a quadrilateral.One , two , three , four.These are all quadrilaterals.They all have four sides , four vertices , and , clearly , four angles.One angle , two angles , three angles , and four angles.Actually , let me draw this one a little bit bigger , because it 's interesting.So in this one right over here , youhave one angle , two angles , three angles , and thenyou have this really big angle right over there.If you look at the interior angles of this quadrilateral.Now , quadrilaterals , as you can imagine , can be subdivided into other groupsbased on the properties of the quadrilaterals.And the main subdivision of quadrilateralsis between concave and convex quadrilaterals.So you have concave , and you have convex.And the way I remember concave quadrilaterals , or really concave polygons of any number of shapes , is that it looks like something has caved in.So , for example , this is a concave quadrilateral.It looks like this side has been caved in.And one way to define concave quadrilaterals -- so let me draw it a little bit bigger , so this right over hereis a concave quadrilateral -- is that ithas an interior angle that is larger than 180 degrees.So for example , this interior angle right over hereis larger than 180 degrees.And it 's an interesting proof.Maybe I 'll do a video.It 's actually a pretty simple proof to show that , if you have a concave quadrilateral , if at least oneof the interior angles has a measure larger than 180degrees , that none of the sides can be parallel to each other.The other type of quadrilateral , you can imagine , is when all of the interior anglesare less than 180 degrees.And you might say , wait -- what happens at 180 degrees ? Well , if this angle was 180 degrees , then these would n't be two different sides , it would just be one side.And that would look like a triangle.But if all of the interior anglesare less than 180 degrees , then you'redealing with a convex quadrilateral.So this convex quadrilateral wouldinvolve that one and that one over there.So this right over here is what a convex quadrilateralcould look like -- four points , four sides , four angles.Now , within convex quadrilaterals , there are some other interesting categorizations.So now we 're just going to focus on convex quadrilaterals , so that 's going to be all of this space over here.So one type of convex quadrilateral is a trapezoid.And a trapezoid is a convex quadrilateral , and sometimes the definition hereis a little bit -- different people willuse different definitions.So some people will say a trapezoidis a quadrilateral that has exactly two sides thatare parallel to each other.So , for example , they would say that this right over hereis a trapezoid , where this side is parallel to that side.If I give it some letters here , if I call this trapezoid ABCD , we could say that segment AB is parallel to segment DC , and because of that we know that this is a trapezoid.Now I said that the definition is a little fuzzy , because some people say you can have exactly onepair of parallel sides , but some peoplesay at least one pair of parallel sides.So if you use the original definition -- and that 's the kind of thing that most people are referringto when they say a trapezoid , exactlyone pair of parallel sides -- It might be something like this.But if you use the broader definition of at least one pairof parallel sides , then maybe thiscould also be considered a trapezoidso you have one pair of parallel sides like thatand then you have another pair of parallel sides like that.So this is a question mark where it comes to a trapezoid.A trapezoid is definitely this thing here , where you have exactly one pair of parallel sides.Depending on people 's definition , this may or may not be a trapezoid.If you say it 's exactly one pair of parallel sides , this is not a trapezoid , because it has two pairs.If you say at least one pair of parallel sides , then this is a trapezoid.So I 'll put that in a little question mark there.But there is a name for this , regardlessof your definition of what a trapezoid is.If you have a quadrilateral with two pairs of parallel sides , you are then dealing with a parallelogram.So the one thing that you definitely can call thisis a parallelogram.And I 'll just draw it a little bit bigger.So it 's a quadrilateral , and if I have a quadrilateral , and if I have two pairs of parallel sides.So the opposite sides are parallel.So that side is parallel to that side , and then this side is parallel to that sidethere -- you 're dealing with a parallelogram.And then parallelograms can be subdivided even further.If the four angles in a parallelogramare all right angles , you're dealing with a rectangle.So let me draw one like that.This is all in the parallelogram universe , what I 'm drawing right over here.This is all the parallelogram universe.So it 's a parallelogram , which tells methat opposite sides are parallel.And then if we know that all four angles are 90 degrees.And we 've proven in previous videoshow to figure out the sum of the interior angles of any polygon.And using that same method you couldsay that the sum of the interior angles of any quadrilateralis actually 360 degrees.And you see that in this special case as well.But maybe we 'll prove it in a separate video.But this right over here we would call a rectangle.Parallelogram -- opposite sides paralleland we have four right angles.Now , if we have a parallelogram where we do n't necessarilyhave four right angles , but wherewe do have the length of the sides being equal , then we 're dealing with a rhombus.So let me draw it like that.So it 's a parallelogram.This is a parallelogram , so that side is parallel to that side , this side is parallel to that side.And we also know that all four sides have equal length.So this side 's length is equal to that side 's length , whichis equal to that side 's length , whichis equal to that side 's length.Then we are dealing with a rhombus.So one way to view it -- all rhombi are parallelograms.All rectangles are parallelograms.All parallelograms you can not assume to be rectangles.All parallelograms you can not assume to be rhombi.Now , something can be both a rectangle and a rhombus.So let 's say that this is the universe of rectangles.So the universe of rectangles -- I'lldraw a little bit of a Venn diagram here -- is that set of shapes and the universe of rhombiis this set of shapes right over here.So what would it look like ? Well , you would have four right anglesand they would all have the same length.So it would look like this.So it 'd definitely be a parallelogram.Four right angles and all the sideswould have the same length.And this is probably the first of the shapes that you learned , or one of the first shapes.This is clearly a square.So all squares could also be considered a rhombus , and they could also be considered a rectangle , and they could also be considered a parallelogram.But clearly , not all rectangles are squares , and not all rhombi are squares.And definitely not all parallelograms are squares.This one , clearly , right over here , is neither a rectangle nor a rhombi , nor a square.So that 's an overview.Just gives you a little bit of taxonomy of quadrilaterals.And then in the next few videos , wecan start to explore them and findtheir interesting properties or just dointeresting problems involving them .
