We have seen what natural and whole numbers are.The whole numbers comprise of the entire setof natural numbers and zero.So what are integers then ? Let 's zoom in a bit.Along with whole numbers , the set of integers also includes negative numberslike minus 1 , minus 2 , minus 3 and so on.We have numbers like 1 , 2 ,3 and so on , so that we can count.We also know why we have a 0 . Now the question , why negative numbers ? The most basic example would be temperature.The temperature can go below ' 0 ' degrees and the temperaturebelow ' 0 ' degree is negative . Like 'minus 10 degrees'.Let us see a different example.Suppose you gave your friend 100 rupees , and that friend returned just 50 rupees.What is the net amount you have now ? The net amount you have is 'minus 50 rupees'.We know there is no note available in the marketwhich amounts to 'minus 50 rupees'.But a negative sign tells us that you are in a loss.Coming back to integers . All these numbers are integers.We zoom out slightly to understand another interesting concept.The numbers 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 and so on are called positive integers.And numbers minus 1 , minus 2 , minus 3and so on are called negative integers.We can also define natural numbers , as positive integers.Then what about ' 0 ' ? Well , it 's neither positive nor negative.Now look at all three of them together . It tells us thatall natural numbers and whole numbers are integers.The set of integers , would look something like this.And the set of integers are represented by the letter ' Z'.Now we know what integers are and why they are used . test
