two seemingly unrelated challenge first music second give foundational result measure theory formal underpinning mathematician define integration probability second challenge get halfway video covering open set counter intuitive least first saw confused foremost like explain going also plan share surprising connection music first challenge going play musical note given frequency say hertz going choose number call r play second musical note whose frequency r times frequency first note value ratio r like two sound harmonious together like square root sound cacophonous task determine whether given ratio r give pleasant sound unpleasant one number without listening one way answer especially name might two sound good ratio rational number bad irrational instance ratio give musical fifth give musical fourth give major sixth best guess case musical note made rapid succession instance per second ratio two rational detectable pattern slow hear rhythm instead harmony evidently brains pick pattern two sound nice together however rational actually sound pretty bad like issue course rational number somehow ear pick pattern one simple way measure complexity rational number consider size denominator written reduced form might edit original answer admit fraction low denominator say less even still quite capture harmoniousness since plenty sound good together even ratio irrational long close harmonious rational number good thing many instrument tuned term rational interval tuned half step increase correspond multiplying original frequency root irrational curious done henry minute physics recently video give nice explanation mean take harmonious interval like fifth ratio piano nice rational number like expect case instead power root case irrational close similarly musical fourth correspond close fact reason works well chromatic scale root strange tendency within margin error simple rational might say ratio r produce harmonious pair sufficiently close rational number sufficiently small denominator close depend discerning ear small denominator depend intricacy harmonic pattern ear trained pick maybe someone particularly acute musical sense would able hear find pleasure pattern resulting complicated fraction like well closely fraction lead interesting question suppose musical savant find pleasure pair whose rational ratio even super complicated ratio would find cacophonous case would find ratio r harmonious even irrational given real number always find rational arbitrarily close close well bring us challenge number mathematician like ask riddle covering various set open interval answer riddle strange tendency become famous lemma theorem mean continuous stretch real strictly greater number strictly less number b b course greater challenge involve covering rational open interval say mean particular rational number least one interval obvious way use entire interval call done challenge sum length interval must strictly less aid seemingly impossible task use infinitely many interval even still task might feel impossible since rational dense real meaning stretch matter small contain infinitely many rational could possibly cover rational without covering entire interval would mean total length open interval least length entire interval talking way first enumerate rational meaning organize infinitely long list many ways one natural way choose start write since already reduced fraction denominator reduced fraction denominator fashion every fraction appear exactly list reduced form give us meaningful way talk rational number rational number rational number thing like next ensure rational covered going assign one specific interval rational remove interval geometry setup think list one responsible one rational number seem much clearer sum length less since particular interval small want still cover designate rational fact sum positive number choose infinite sum positive term converge like choose desired value like multiply term epsilon infinite sum converging epsilon scale nth interval length equal nth term sum notice mean interval start getting really small really fast small really see animation matter since one responsible covering one rational said already say amazing epsilon whatever positive number want sum less arbitrarily small one result even seeing proof still intuition discord proof us thinking analytically rational list intuition us thinking geometrically rational dense set interval skip continuous stretch since stretch contain infinitely many rational get visual understanding going brief side note trouble illustrate small open interval since scale parentheses interval able see push parentheses together cross way potentially nevertheless decided go ugly chromosomal cross keep mind interval represent tiny stretch parenthesis back visual intuition consider epsilon meaning choose number random outside infinitely many interval look like outside interval well square root among going zoom draw first interval list within scope vision get closer square root even though always find rational within field view interval top rational get really small really fast one might say sequence rational approaching square root interval covering element sequence shrink faster sequence converge notice interval really small show late list rational show late list large denominator fact square root among covered interval sense way formalize otherwise vague idea rational large denominator say square root cacophonous fact use smaller epsilon say shift setup lie top interval instead fall among elite covered tiny interval almost harmonious instance harmonious irrational number close relatively fat interval sitting top interval around smaller still fat enough cover member cacophonous well cacophonous rational meaning high denominator irrational close however think savant find harmonic pattern rational could imagine harmonious precisely covered interval provided tolerance error goes exponentially complicated rational word seemingly paradoxical fact collection interval densely populate range covering value correspond fact harmonious rare even savant saying make result intuitive fact find quite surprising savant defined could find ratio cacophonous fact two connected simply beautiful share music measure theory music measure theory music measure theory music measure theory
