video going taking look finding relative function one got particular feature one particular want address let start finding critical finding critical find taking derivative function going f prime x going use quotient rule one bottom times derivative top would x third minus top x fourth plus times derivative bottom allover bottom squared x squared squaring fifth minus little x fifth minus x fourth got like term combine x fifth minus x fourth right point set numerator denominator equal zero find let come take denominator set equal zero x zero taking fourth root sides get x equal zero right special case address zero domain function x squared bottom x can not zero right let put right therefore acritical number critical number however going address herein little bit show still important right going take set equal zero fifth minus equal zero let gon na leave x fourth minus let keep going way going x squared plus x squared minus difference square let another difference two square x squared plus x plus x minus definitely completely right sending one equal get x equal right equal get critical would imaginary number right setting equal get x equal negative equal get x equal right definitely critical negative pop ped two different place considered critical number right domain however n say important something need right visualize n critical number right done rough sketch hereof graph look like visual representation look x plus x squared really rough hand sketch right critical found negative got right right defined vertical asymptote got unbounded behavior going right x equal considered acritical number domain function right still important something going got unbound behavior going right number line test going want put zero number critical number something important going right point got two critical got x gon na go ahead put number line drawing number line make kind long alright need negative zero need one put interval across top negative infinity negative infinity right let go ahead label need take look derivative need take look original function let go back identify derivative derivative alright number would relatively large negative number going negative top positive bottom dividing would geta negative alright smaller negative number smaller negative number going give positive divided positive overall answer going positive answer positive small number give positive negative top positive bottom going negative really big number going give positive divided positive going positive looking first derivative tell section since negative original function decreasing section original function increasing decreasing increasing right alright determine going decreasing increasing original function going decreasing increasing right minimum would ordered pair negative plugging negative original function going give set domain going increasing right remember domain got something else happening vertical asymptote n accidentally forget claim maximum maybe remind critical number maximum going original function going decreasing increasing minimum plugging gon na relative got two negative right one example one example finding relative special case end finding turns acritical number yet important important enough definitely want put number line testing region definitely thanks watching n forget subscribe channel thanks finding relative calculus finding relative calculus finding relative calculus finding relative calculus finding relative calculus finding relative calculus finding relative calculus finding relative calculus finding relative calculus finding relative calculus finding relative calculus finding relative calculus finding relative calculus finding relative calculus finding relative calculus finding relative calculus finding relative calculus finding relative calculus finding relative calculus finding relative calculus finding relative calculus
