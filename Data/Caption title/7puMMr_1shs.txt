in this video I 'm going to be taking alook at finding some relative extremafor a function this one 's got aparticular feature in there that 's why Ichose this one in particular that I wantto address so let 's just start byfinding the critical numbers so findingcritical numbers okay we find criticalnumbers by taking the derivative of thefunction so we 're going to do F prime ofX and we 're going to use quotient ruleon this one so the bottom times thederivative at the top which would be 4 Xto the third minus the top which is X tothe fourth plus 1 times the derivativeof the bottom which is a 2x and then allover the bottom squared so x squared andthen squaring that again doing a littlesimplifying here we 'll have a 4x to thefifth minus doing a little distributingthere a 2 X to the fifth minus a 2x andthen all over X to the fourth I 've gotsome like terms there that I can combinenow so I will have a 2 X to the fifthminus 2x all over and X to the fourthall right at this point then I can setboth the numerator and the denominatorequal to zero and find some creditpoints there so let 's come up here anddo that if I take the denominator andset that equal to zero X to the fourthequals zero taking the fourth root ofboth sides I get x equals zero all rightnow this is that special case that Iwanted to address here zero is not inthe domain of this function because I'vegot an x squared on the bottom so Xcannot be zero all right so let 's putnot in domainall right so therefore it 's not acritical number not a critical numberhowever we 're going to address it herein a little bit and show you why it'sstill important all right now we'regoing to take that numrand set that equal to zero so 2x to thefifth minus 2x equals zero let 's pullout a 2x that 's gon na leave me with an Xto the fourth minus a 1 all rightfactoring this let 's keep going andfactoring all the way down here I'mgoing to have a 2x and then I 'm going tohave an x squared plus 1 and an xsquared minus 1 for the difference oftwo squares there now let 's keepfactoring because here is anotherdifference of two squares so 2x xsquared plus 1 and then this factorsinto an X plus 1 and an X minus 1 so nowI have definitely completely factoredthis all right now sending each one ofthese equal to 0 this I get x equals 0all right and again not in my domainokaysetting this equal to 0 I get nocritical numbers here because it wouldbe an imaginary numberall right setting this equal to 0 I'mgoing to get X equal to negative 1setting this equal to 0 I get x equals 1all right so definitely critical numbershere at negative 1 and 1 now 0 popped upin two different places but 0 is notconsidered to be a critical number allright because it 's not in the domainhowever that does n't say that it 's notimportant and it 's not something that weneed right now to visualize why thisis n't a critical numberall right I 've done a rough sketch hereof what the graph looks like so we havea visual representation to look at okaytaking this X to the 4th plus 1 over xsquared this is a really rough handsketch of this all rightcritical numbers we found at thenegative 1 & 1clearly because I 've got horizontaltangents right there all right but xequals 0 is not defined because I 've gota vertical asymptote there we 've gotsome unbounded behavior going on rightthere at x equals 0 so while it eventhough it is not considered to be acritical number because it 's not in thedomain of the function all right it'sstill important because something coolis going on we 've got that unboundbehavior going on right there and sowhen we do the number line test it youare going to want to put that zero onyour number lineokay just because not because it'scritical number but because somethingimportant is going on right there okayso at this point I 've got my twocritical numbers and I 've got X equalszero that I 'm gon na go ahead and put onmy number line so drawing a number linewill make it kind of long here alrightso we need a negative onewe 'd zero and we need a one all rightlet 's put our intervals across the topnegative infinity to negative 1 negative1 to 0 0 to 1 and 1 to infinity allright and then let 's go ahead and labelwe need to take a look at our derivativeand we need to take a look at ouroriginal function here and let 's go backand identify where that derivative wasok so there 's that derivativealright so picking the number in herewhich would be a relatively largenegative number okay then I 'm going tohave a negative on top and a positive onthe bottom so dividing there I would geta negative alright picking a smallernegative number okay smaller negativenumber there is going to give me apositive divided by positive so theoverall answer is going to be a positivepicking a positive answer here positivesmall number will give me a positive ontop and a negative on top positive onthe bottom so then it 's going to be anegative and then picking a really bignumber there is going to give me apositive divided by positive so it'sgoing to be positive looking at thatfirst derivative now that tells me thenin this section since it 's a negativethe original function will be decreasingand in this section here the originalfunction will be increasing here it willbe decreasing and then here it will beincreasing all right now from thisalright I can determine my extrema it'sgoing fromdecreasing to increasing my originalfunction is going from decreasing toincreasing right here so then that meansthat I have a minimum at and it would bethe ordered pair of negative 1 pluggingnegative 1 into that original functionthere is going to give me a 2 and thenhere we set 0 is not in the domain eventhough it 's going from increasing todecreasing all rightremember it 's not in the domain I 've gotsomething else happening there it wasthat vertical asymptote here so youdo n't accidentally forget and then claimthat that is a maximum so maybe youremind yourself not a critical numberbecause that will not be a maximum andthen here at 1 again I 'm going from theoriginal function is going fromdecreasing to increasing so then I havea minimum at 1 and then plugging oneback in I 'm gon na have a 2 again so thatrelative extrema I 've got two minimumsoccurring at negative 1/2 and 1/2 allright so one example just one example offinding that relative extrema but thenwith a special case where you end upfinding a 0 and it turns out to not be acritical number but yet very veryimportant important enough that you'regoing to definitely want to put it onthat number
