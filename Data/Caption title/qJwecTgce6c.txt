hi rob welcome math antic lesson going learn another important geometry quantity cal led volume specifically going learn volume kind use measure volume calculate volume simple geometric first thing need know volume quantity object understand mean help back little start object like line segment measure object need quantity usually call length length line happen exactly one centimeter common unit measuring length math antic video area saw move extend line direction perpendicular distance one centimeter form object cal led object measured quantity call area original line one centimeter long extended distance one centimeter amount area square one square centimeter common unit measuring area imagine take square move extend direction perpendicular surface distance centimeter form object cal led cube measure object like use quantity cal led volume volume tell us much space space object much volume cube well since made extending square centimeter distance one centimeter dimension say volume exactly one cubic centimeter common unit measuring volume square used measure area cubic used measure volume since square made multiplying two together like centimeter times centimeter abbreviate exponent notation centimeter power centimeter squared since cubic made multiplying three together like centimeter times centimeter times centimeter abbreviate exponent notation centimeter power centimeter cube like different sizes square like square inch es square square also different sized cubic like cubic inch es cubic cubic mi lessee area square related volume cubic another similarity remember use square measure area shape square well use cubic measure volume shape see works take look circle object cal led sphere like ball like bunch small square approximate area circle use bunch small approximate volume sphere really cool smaller square use closer combined area match area circle smaller use closer combined volume match volume volume quantity measuring object since also tal ked lot area video want point object also type area want confuse volume might remember previous video quantity cal led area quantity cal led perimeter well similar way object quantity cal led volume quantity cal led cal led surface area surface area lot like area object outer surface shell perimeter surface area outer geometric outer boundary shape surface area outer boundary shape help see difference surface area volume imagine perfectly thin box filled ice unfold box see area surround volume volume amount space ice inside box alright understand volume confuse surface area going spend rest video learning calculate volume basic geometric want quickly mention something important terminology word use describe thing math time people agree call thing math away sand especially true comes word use describe dimension geometric object stake word length width height example rectangle could name two dimension length width like area video could also name width height wan ted actual dimension really important different might use different important thing flexible realize math concept even different word used explain example area rectangle always found multiplying two side dimension together matter back calculating lot formed taking shape extending along third dimension example start rectangle extend along third dimension get shape cal led rectangular prism start triangle extend along third dimension get shape cal led triangular prism start circle extend along third dimension get shape cal led cylinder might thought cal led circular prism technically prism formed extending polygon since circle polygon resulting shape cal led good news general formula calculating volume type shape find area original shape got extended multiply length distance extended usually original shape cal led base object let start rectangular prism calculate volume base original rectangle dimension centimeter find area base need remember calculate area rectangle multiply two side dimension centimeter times centimeter give us centimeter squared find volume need multiply area length base extended diagram tell us distance centimeter multiply centimeter squared centimeter get centimeter rectangular prism volume cubic let try find volume triangular prism first step calculate area base prism triangle formula finding area triangle one half triangle base times height careful confuse base triangle base prism triangle diagram tell us base triangle inch es height inch es one half base times height would one half times times one half area triangle inch es squared find volume multiply area length extended told length inch es multiple inch es squared inch es get inch es volume ready try finding volume cylinder cylinder made extending circle first need calculate area circle learned previous video area circle found multiplying pi times radius squared radius circle square get squared multiply pi approximately get squared know area circle find volume cylinder multiply area length circle extended happen times squared give us volume cylinder cubic see find volume like made taking shape extending along third axis find area shape multiply length extended give volume works works trapezoid pentagon diamond know accurately calculate volume playtime way fun course made extending shape along third dimension made rotating shape around axis sphere saw ear lier video instance one way form sphere rotate circle around one diameter line sand another common shape formed rotating shape around axis cone formed rotating right triangle around one two perpendicular formula finding volume sphere cones complicated explain time learn arrive video best memorize formula use test need toto find volume sphere use formula volume equal times pi times radius cube dand find volume cone use formula volume equal one third times height times pi times radius squared let try one example wrap sphere radius dimension need find volume formula say volume sphere equal x pi x radius mean multiplying times take c x c x c equal c multiply approximation pi times last multiply multiplying dividing give us volume centimeter let try cone use formula find volume cone need know two thing radius circle form base cone heigh cone similar height triangle distance point tip cone straight center circular base radius base cone fee height first let plug radius equation square fee x fee fee squared next multiply pi get fee squared may notice area base circle need multiply base area one third times height times fee fee fee times square fee give us cubic fee volume know lot volume know quantity geometric object know measure volume cubic also learned calculate volume basic course lot time cover video know common key put learned practice trying exercise problem always thanks watching
