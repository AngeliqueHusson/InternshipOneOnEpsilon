An ecologist surveys the age of about 100 treesin a local forest.He uses a box-and-whisker plot to map his data shown below.What is the range of tree ages that he surveyed ? What is the median age of a tree in the forest ? So first of all , let's make sure we understandwhat this box-and-whisker plot is even about.This is really a way of seeing the spread of allof the different data points , which are the age of the trees , and to also give other informationlike , what is the median ? And where do most of the ages of the trees sit ? So this whisker part , so you could see this black partis a whisker , this is the box , and thenthis is another whisker right over here.The whiskers tell us essentially the spread of all of the data.So it says the lowest to data point in this sampleis an eight-year-old tree.I 'm assuming that this axis down here is in the years.And it says at the highest -- the oldest tree right over hereis 50 years.So if we want the range -- and whenwe think of range in a statistics point of viewwe 're thinking of the highest datapoint minus the lowest data point.So it 's going to be 50 minus 8.So we have a range of 42.So that 's what the whiskers tell us.It tells us that everything falls between 8 and 50 years , including 8 years and 50 years.Now what the box does , the box starts at -- well , let me explain it to you this way.This line right over here , this is the median.And so half of the ages are goingto be less than this median.We see right over here the median is 21.So this box-and-whiskers plot tells usthat half of the ages of the trees are less than 21and half are older than 21.And then these endpoints right over here , these are the medians for each of those sections.So this is the median for all the treesthat are less than the real medianor less than the main median.So this is in the middle of all of the ages of treesthat are less than 21.This is the middle age for all the treesthat are greater than 21 or older than 21.And so we 're actually splitting all of the datainto four groups.This we would call the first quartile.So I 'll call it Q1 for our first quartile.Maybe I 'll do 1Q.This is the first quartile.Roughly a fourth of the tree , because the wayyou calculate it , sometimes a tree ends upin one point or another , about a fourth of the treesend up here.A fourth of the trees are between 14 and 21.A fourth are between 21 and it looks like 33.And then a fourth are in this quartile.So we call this the first quartile , the second quartile , the third quartile , and the fourth quartile.So to answer the question , we already did the range.There 's a 42-year spread between the oldest and the youngesttree.And then the median age of a tree in the forest is at 21.So even though you might have trees that are as old as 50 , the median of the forest is actuallycloser to the lower end of our entire spectrum of allof the ages.So if you view median as your central tendency measurement , it 's only at 21 years.And you can even see it.It 's closer to the left of the boxand closer to the end of the left whiskerthan the end of the right whisker .
