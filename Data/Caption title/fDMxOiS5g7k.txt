hey guys today 's lesson will be onsolving equations where there are nowvariables on both sides of the equationand a couple things I want to I guessclarify is in vocabulary we talked aboutcombining like terms and when we talkabout collecting like terms they arevery very similar usually we talk aboutcombining like terms we talked about oneside of an equationcollecting means collecting everythingon one side or the other so but both ofthese I abbreviate often as CLT andyou 'll see that in a lot of my videos inin our powerpoints okay and like I saidsince we 're going to deal with variableson both sides of the equation what whatyou have to do is pick your side when Isay pick your side it does n't matterwhich side you pick but you 're going tocollect all your variable terms on oneside and all your constant terms on theother so that 's kind of our whole choreis to put everything all our variableterms those terms that have variables onone side and our constant terms on theother side of an equation okay okay soour first equation here 7x equals 4xplus 15 okay so what we 're going to dois pick our sides okay so I have twosides I 'm going to put my variable termson this side and my constant terms onthe right side here now again it doesn'tmatter I could have picked either waybut let me just give you a little hint Ialways look at the coefficient of thevariables and whatever the largercoefficient in this case seven of courseis larger than four that 's a side I pickas my variable side the reason I do thatis I I avoid getting negativecoefficients by doing that soon as youpick your side now I want to get thevariable term off the constant side okayso I 'm going to subtract 4x from thisside but if I subtract 4x from thesociety of course subtracted from thissidethese are like terms so we collectedthat all the X 's on this side bycombining like terms so that 's the CLTwe both collect and combine like termsthis 15 which goes along for the ridenow I have just a variable term on thisside a constant term on this side nowI 'm ready to solve which of course thismeans dividing both sides by 3 we have xequals 5 okayokay now what I 'd like you to do is trythis one on your own and then I 'll comeback in and do the work for you okay gookay here notice I do have variables onboth sides I 'm going to pick my sidesbecause this coefficient is larger thanthis coefficient I 'm going to pick myvariable terms on this side my constantson this side I need to get him off thisright side because this has meant forconstants so I 'm going to subtract 3xfrom this side if I do it from this sideof course do it from this side you justgo along for the ride but now notice Ihave a constant on the variable sideokay so I 'm going to add 2 to get rid ofthis because negative 2 and a positive 2will give me 0 add to this side if I doit here I of course have to do it hereour last step of course is to get Xalone I divide by 2okayonce you guys try this one okay againI 'm going to be picking my sides hereand you know I see that 9 is larger than5 so I 'm going to collect my variableson the left side and my constants on theright I always go about moving my car myvariables first off the constant side soI 'm going to get rid of this 5 in bysubtracting 5 and of course that willsum to 0 but if I do it to this side Iof course do it to this side now when Iget rid of my constant from my variableside okay so I add 6 to both sidesnegative 6 and a positive 6 gets rid ofthe variable on this side I have avariable term this side I have aconstant exactly like I want now I cansolve for himonce you go ahead and give this one ashot okay now notice now I have multipleterms I have more than just two so thefirst thing I always think about is Iwant to clean clean up one side or theother so I notice I have like terms hereso I can clean this up 6y to negative 3yI like to clean up one side at a timeand notice on the right side I cancombine the negative five and thepositive seventeen so I 'm going tocombine like terms on each side tosimplify the expression on each sideonce I get it down to here now I 'm goingto pick my side I 'm going to pick thissize my variable size because three islarger than one subtract Y from bothsides so I got rid of the variable termoff the constant side now I want to getthe constant off the variable side so Isubtract four from both sides divided bytwo gives me my answer of y equals fourokay give this one a shot okay again I'mgoing to clean this side up first likecombining like terms now I 'm going tothis time I 'm going to pick this sidetoo to gather my variable terms because4 is of course larger than 1 as acoefficient so this side is going to bemy variable side this is going to be myconstant side I always attack thecontent of the variables first so Isubtract X from both sides subtract 32from both sides now I 've got this so Icould divide by 3 to get x equalsnegative 6 okay okaygive this one a shotokay now here there 's a couple differentthings we could do I can combine liketerms or I could distribute but what Ireally want to do is I want to focus onI want to simplify this side and I wantto simplify first before I startcollecting and combining okay so I'mgoing to distribute here I 'm now goingto combine like terms on this side soI 've cleaned up the left side I'vecleaned up the right side and now I cango about picking a side now noticenegative three and negative six as mycoefficients negative three is actuallylarger so I 'm going to use this as myvariable side and I 'm going to add six asix K to both sides and notice whathappens that keeps this positive I liketo do keep it positive as much aspossible divide both sides by 3 we get Kequals 1 okay all right so these are thelast two problems I need you to doentirely on your own remember yourhomework should be formatted in a boxeighth format and these two problemswill show up as number seven and numbereight in your box a format okay and wewill see you tomorrow Solving Equation with variables on both sides of the equation Solving Equation with variables on both sides of the equation Solving Equation with variables on both sides of the equation
