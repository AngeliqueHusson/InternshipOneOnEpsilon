well mathematician like tube often inspired stuff see tube recently saw two clips gave idea want tell impressive sure n anything else march main occupation right impressive found even impressive people competition really impressive anyway basically square around obviously mathematician like square like circle like sort thing thought well maybe want idea two identical square kind around wan ted kind devise sort choreography two one big huge square imagine two square kind around eventually kind come together whoops see like one big square good idea let let see whether first thing figure big want make square could start really really small like going work let look right got four another four total eight need square number right going work right ca n really go really small next size three times three three times three nine nine together square number going work let keep square number plus actually pretty one anyway let keep searching eventually got find something hopefully already pretty close let use actually going work eventually going work want something small near miss right squared squared squared squared also one right good enough actually show us going happen let worry actually finding right example let keep going choreography going actually merge two square together also thing want say since much trouble finding square si going use example eventually going important later let say example exist going choreography going merge two square together go going march square actually kind template us see actually go eventually blue dot fit grid going march two square left right like going overlap middle bit problem maybe really stand comrade right basically double red point doubled right mean square seeing nobody standing one person standing blue every one red two people doubled right take guy standing fit empty square right eventually know whatever start supposed fill spot right mean course red square exactly big two little together right logical conclusion right one plus one equal well great something really really really strange remember star ted saying example two identical smaller square combine square found even smaller one show possible supposed example found even smaller one think actually way resolve paradox say well example example ca n smaller example basically start assumption find example show us kind paradox contradiction show us ca n example actually way merge two identical square square shown actually mathematics cal led proof contradiction assume something case make logical deduction come point see nonsense something true nonsense ca n follow mean star ted nonsense first place mean whatever opposite assumed true case two identical square possibly combine two square alright also express mathematically algebraically two integer square ca n add another integer square like transform little bit times squared equal n squared n work divide one ca n work square root see one ca n work say square root written fraction fraction integer say square root irrational actually square scenario square consideration also show square root two right else say actually near miss example used squared plus squared equal squared minus mean use illustration actually really going nice symmetric way something nice coming want show one kind march square way get overlap righto kay actually star ted mean exact green bit exactly big two combine together since star ted near miss well closed close actually check got one two three four five got one two three four five six seven near miss kind already beginning square plus squared equal seven squared plus one stop right move two guy middle going create overlap let see get well got two squared two squared eight one nine another near miss right get another near miss else n stop really simple one still near miss squared plus squared equal squared plus right one one near miss es kind know get sort near miss es kind repeat procedure really really quite fun actually get smaller also kind go backwards go backwards actually get near miss es let go backwards kind go like unmerge right put square get us back beginning want next higher next bigger near miss put big square around thislike measure wide another square inside measure far squared plus squared equal squared plus take two square arrange like put big square around get another example another example another example actually going two another square difference couple example heaps left side near also really nice another way let example look actually look fraction get get get one think happening well getting closer closer square root one actually really really really really good approximation square root mean people always obsess pi like one thing know pi almost pi right actually looking fraction know square probably go one nobody know one play role square root play pi root deadly square root deadly square root deadly square root deadly square root deadly square root deadly square root deadly
