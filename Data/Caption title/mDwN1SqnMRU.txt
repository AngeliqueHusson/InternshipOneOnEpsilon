okay in this video I just want to talkabout graphing quadratic functions andjust a simple example and here 's mylittle checklist of usually things thatI 'll run through when I have to you knowproduce a rough sketch of a quadraticfunction so I 'm assuming that yourquadratic is in standard form so againeverything 's basically multiplied out wehave ax squared plus BX plus C and againto be a quadratic we need the a we needthe x squared term in there so thatmeans a can equal 0 recall that yourparabola will open upwards if the avalues positive and it 'll open downwardsif the a values negative to find thevertex which will either be you know thehighest point on the parabola or thelowest point on the parabola we can usethe formula negative B over 2a that willgive us the x-coordinate of the vertexplug that into your function you 'll getthe y-coordinate to find x-intercepts ifthere are any I 'll either factor if it'snot easy to factor I 'll just use thequadratic formula and then to get they-intercept I simply plug 0 into thefunction so let 's do one here x squaredminus 2x minus 8 so again we do n't see acoefficient in front of the x squaredbut again we it 's understood that that'sa 1 so since the coefficient is a 1 onthe x squared termwell that 's greater than 0 that meansthat our parabola will open upwards okayso if it opens upwards I know there'sgoing to be kind of a lowest point on myparabola the second thing that I 'm goingto do here again you do n't have to dothis in any particular order I 'm goingto find the vertex using the the xcoordinate of the vertex using thenegative B over 2a formula so again a isthe number in front of x squared so oura value in this case will be 1 the Bvalue is whatever numbers in front of Xand again make sure you take intoconsiderationsign so our B value in this case isnegative - it turns out that theconstant that 's hanging out you don'tneed it has no effect on the vertex wellI should n't say it has no effect it'sgoing to have no effect on the xcoordinate of the vertex it certainlywill affect it to Y value so let me becareful about what I say there so okayso if we use the formula negative B over2a we 'll just have negative well ofnegative 2 and then we take 2 times thea value which is 1 so hey we 'll simplyget 2 over 2 which says the x-coordinateof our vertex is going to equal 1 okayso that 's the x-coordinate of the vertexand now all I have to do is plug thatback into my function to get the Y valueok so to get the Y value we just plug in1 so f of 1 will be 1 squared minus 2times 1 minus 8 so that 's 1 minus 2minus 8 and that to me looks like thevalue negative 9 so it says hey when youplug one end we get out the valuenegative 9 and this will be our vertexok so that will be useful for us as welllet me give myself a little more roomhere ok so the third thing at least inthe order I had it written down was tofind x-intercepts and remember to findx-intercepts you basically replace the Yvalue or equivalently the f of X we setthat equal to zero so if I take myequation and I replace the f of X withzero well now I have to solve thisequation 0 equals x squared minus 2xminus 8 so again to solve these you caneither factor or use the quadraticformulaI believe this one factors so to get xsquared we 'll need X and X okay so now Ilook for two numbers that multiply tonegative 8 butadd up to negative 2 how about negative4 and positive 2 I believe that willwork and if we set each piece equal to 0we 'll set X minus 4 equal to 0 that willgive us the x intercept of 4 if we setthe other part the other factor equal to0 we 'll get x equals negative 2 and okso it means in this case our functionhas two x-intercepts and if you reallyif you think about the vertex and if youthink about the fact that it 's openingupwards and two ative Lee I think itshould have I mean two x-intercepts ifyou just think about the geometry solet 's see so I know my x-intercepts aregoing to be at 4 and negative 2 and thelast thing is simply to get they-intercept and that 's pretty easy to doso to get the y-intercept we just let Xequal 0 so if we plug in 0 for X we'llget 0 squared minus 2 times 0 minus 8and that to me looks like the valuenegative 8 and now all we have to do isyou know make a little sketch of thisstuff you know if you want if you need afew more points just you know plug in acouple extra x-values and that will giveyou some extra values on your graph okso the first thing I 'm going to plot isthe vertex so it says I go over one unitand down nine units so again a veryrough sketch here I 'm not counting offunits or anything like that I know they-intercept is negative eight ok sothat 's what we actually found in thefourth step so I know it goes through 0comma negative 8 I know the x-interceptsI know it crosses the x-axis at 4 andalso it crosses at negative 2 based onwhat we saw so I 'm going to put somepoints there as well and now I prettymuch just play connect the dots I remindmyself that it 's opening upwards so I'mgoing to try to make a kind of acurvy graph that goes through thosepoints again my artistry is not the bestbut hey there 's a rough sketch of ourparabolaremember the x-coordinate of the vertexsince it goes through the x coordinateof one again this is what 's called theaxis of symmetry so we would say theaxis of symmetry for this parabola isthe line x equals one and if you thinkabout it you know again that makes senseso the x coordinate of four that 's threeunits away from the axis of symmetryalso negative two is three units awayfrom the axis of symmetry so just acouple little observations there to makeand again what I was saying a second agois I know the vertex has a negativey-coordinate and since it was openingupwards I knew that we had to find twox-intercepts it just has to cross twiceso when I do my step on the X interceptsif I do n't find any x-intercepts wellthen I know I 've certainly donesomething wrong so all right I hope thisa simple example helps you out if youhave any questions or comments as alwaysfeel free to post them test
