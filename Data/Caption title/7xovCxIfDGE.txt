in this problem we 're given that apolygon has 17 sides and were asked tofind the sum of the measures of itsinterior angles remember that theformula for finding the sum of themeasures of the interior angles of apolygon is a hundred and eighty times nminus 2 where n represents the number ofsides so heresince our polygon has 17 sides we canplug a 17 in for the N in our formulaand we have 180 times 17 minus 2simplifying inside the parentheses first17 minus 2 is 15 so we have 180 times 15which is 2700 so if a polygon has 17sides then the sum of the measures ofits interior angles is 2700 degrees notethat you may want to use a calculator inthis section since the numbers you 'll beworking with will be fairly large test
