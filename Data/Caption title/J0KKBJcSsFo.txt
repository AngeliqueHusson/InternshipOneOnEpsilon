welcome to my video on cube roots andanytime that you see this number threein the top left corner of the radicalthis is what we call a cube root and theidea is you want to find some numbermultiplied by itself three times that isequal to the number inside of the rootokay and this will make a lot more senseonce we get started so let 's get startedwith this first example here we have thecube root of eight so we need to find anumber multiplied by itself three timesthat is equal to eight and that 's numbertwo two times two times two two timestwo is equal to four four times two isequal to 8 so 2 multiplied by itselfthree times is equal to eight so thecube root of 8 is equal to 2 let 's goover a negative example here we have thecube root of negative 125 and if you'refamiliar with square roots or even powerroots anytime you see a negative on theinside of a square root or an evenpowered root you need to use imaginarynumbers it 's impossible to find thesolution using real numbers but but thisis not the case for cube roots or anyodd powered root so let 's find a numbermultiplied by itself 3 times that givesus negative 125 so if we rewrite this wecould rewrite it as negative 5multiplied by negative 5 multiplied bynegative 5 if you multiply negative 5times negative 5 that gives you apositive 25 and positive 25 timesnegative 5 is equal to negative 125 sothe cube root of negative 125 is equalto negative 5 and these are really basicexamples because they are perfect cubesand notice how our our answer is a nicewhole number let 's say for example thatwe do n't have a perfect cubesay we have the cube root of 40 how dowe solve this example and what I like todo is to factor this number inside asmuch as possible so if we rewrite thiscube root we know that 40 is equal to 2times 20 and this can still be factoredeven further we still have our 2 on theleft hand side and 20 can be rewrittenas 2 times 10 and you want to continuethis process until you have all primenumbers and we still have our two 2 's onthe left so we have 2 times 2 and the 10can be factored even further 10 can berewritten as 2 times 5 so now we havecompletely factored the inside of theroot and we have n't changed anything 2times 2 is equal to 4 4 times 2 is equalto 8 8 times 5 is equal to 40 and 40 iswhat we started with so we still haven'tchanged anything and the idea is youwant to find groups of 3 since we have a3 in our root we want to find groups of3 and notice how we have a group ofthree twos inside of the root and whatwe want to do is we want to separatethese groups of 3so that 's what I 'm going to do right nowI 'm going to separate this group ofthree twos so we have the cube root ofthe three twos being multiplied by eachother and we still have our 5 on theright so this is being multiplied by thecube root of five and this is just aproperty of roots you could separatethem if they 're being multiplied by eachother so now we 're getting really closeto our solution on the left hand side wehave the cube root of 2 multiplied byitself 3 times the cube root of 2multiplied by itself three times is just2 and this is being multiplied by thecube root of 5 the cube root of 5 cannotbe simplified any further so this is oursolution the cube root of 40 is equal to2 times the cube rootof five so I hope this gave you a betteridea of cube roots in my next video I'mgonna go over some more complicatedexamples like this one where we have afourth roots or higher power roots andwe also have some variables x and yinside of the root as well so if youfeel like you 're confident and you don'tneed any more practice and then a greatjob but if you want to see some harderexamples check out my next video Ireally hope that you are enjoying theseand I will see you in my next one Simplifying cube roots - Perfect cubes and harder examples Simplifying cube roots - Perfect cubes and harder examples Simplifying cube roots - Perfect cubes and harder examples
