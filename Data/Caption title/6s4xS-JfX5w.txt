get a welcome to Tech math Channel whatwe 're gon na be having looking at in thisvideo is we 're gon na be looking atmethods for mental subtraction okay soit 's gon na start out fairly easy we'regonna start out some two-digit numberswe 're gon na get to some harder problemsas we go along though now there 's acouple of different methods you will beusing when you are doing mentalsubtraction are typically both thesemethods to go from left to right you'llsee what I mean by this in a minute butyou can employ the different methodsjust for different types of subtractionquestions one where you 're not borrowingquestions in one where you are trying toborrow off other numbers you 'll againsee what I mean with this so an examplethe type of question that you might getwhen you are asked to subtract onenumber from another give us a two-digitnumberI say we had 98 and I wanted to takeaway 23 okay so this is a nice easy onethe other way that I would guess thatmost people would do this mentally is asfollows they would be c-23 as twodifferent numbers I 'd be seen as 20 andthree and he this is not the way you doit this is not a bad little techniqueanyway so you are taking your weight 20and then you 're taking away three fromthe ID Act so 98 take away 2078 takesaway 3 is 75okay so I 'm going to give you anotherexample this okay so there 's a nice easymethod of doing these to start off withnice why do we do n't have to borrow saywe had say something like 68 and we'regoing to take away 25 okay so nice andeasy it 's at 68 there 's made up a20-year 68 we have 20 at five we'retaking off it 's a 68 48 take your from20forty-three okayso he took off the 21st we got 48 therewere two out of five and we got 43 how'dyou go with that okay they 're they'refairly easy questions these are a reallybasic ones where you do n't have to goabout borrowing and I 'll show you what Imean by thisthis idea of borrowing because I thinkthis is where it gets a bit tricky withmental subtraction occasionally you weregonna start well quite often you'llstart getting dubbers like this one yousubtract you were stuck getting numberssay like ah what about we do somethinglike 84 and we take away 59 so if wewere to do this buna see straight awaythat it 's a little bit hard Easter couldgo 84 and take off 50 gets 34 and thentake away the dime and you would get 25but there 's also another way that youcould do this which you might find alittle bit easier okay you do n't have todo any sort of mental acrobatics in yourheadwell not as much anyway you turn into abit of an addition problem and this isas the way you do this is follow so 59we 're gon na round it up to 60okay and you 're probably gon na realizethat we have taken one too many hereokay we take off 60 the difference herebut is wide so we have 84 takeaway 60 wehave 24 okay but we do n't we do weresupposed to take your 60 was supposed totie off $ 50 I was tied off one three toomany it one through two too manyso we 're gon na have to add that one backon so their answer is 25okay so we take off that next up we'reupside 84 takeaway 60 is 24 plus one soit 's turned into a bit of an additionproblem so I 'll give you a couple moreexamples of these it 's the same we had aquestion uh 82 and we are going to takeaway 34 so what you might do for this isyou might round this up to 40 and you'regonna realize if I take it seeks toomuch so82 42 48 okay Oh show you how I 've donethis okay so we 've got six too much allright that little six down there so Ineed to take away 40 is 42 and I 'm gonnaadd this six on which is 48 and the Btrick for those is not so much all thisright and you see if is anyone thinkingthat same slower it 's trying to do thisin your head okay this is the trick thisis n't mental subtraction we 're afterhere not written subtraction it 's alwayshard to try and explain methylsubtraction sometimes and you 're writingit at the same time so I 'm gon na giveyou a bunch of questions where they saywe did ourwhat about 67 take 48 new bike thatadvancing this really really quickly andwhat about we do 51 take away 27 okayand we will also do a hundred andforty-eight and we 'll take away 79 okaythree different questions okay so howare you get these so first off I 'm gonnado this mentally now okay so 67 takeaway 50 is 17 plus 2 is 1951 take away30is 21 plus 3 is 24a hundred forty eight take away eightyis 68 plus one the 69 see how easy thatisokay what about to give you a couplethat are just a little bit harder okaywhat about we do this type of one whatabout we do say something like 162 andI 'm going to take away Oh97 okay hey that 's not that hard at allis it actually that 's a really easy onebecause this is almost 100 take that offit 's gon na be 60 2 plus 3 our answer isgoing to be 65 okay so we rounded it upto 100 we took that off we 've got 62then we added the 3 extra we need do wegot 65 you see how easy that isokay in the next video what would youlet me have you look at is we can extendthis into bigger numbersso hopefully you find this handy and ifyou do have a look at this next videowe 'll take this even further anywaythanks for watching see you next timebye test
