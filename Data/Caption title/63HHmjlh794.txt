music need know best counter queen gambit ask chess grand master need figure average number step would take randomly moving knight starting square ask mathematician let make problem precise put knight usual starting spot board doesnt matter choose first row last row second left second right theyre symmetric knight three legal move capital l shaped jump make jump probability meaning jump time third time time night continue moving way among allowable move pick square randomly uniform equal probability hop example knight six legal move chance middle board freedom make eight possible news eventually knight make way back starting spot time hop back two move could take much longer path like get center board lot option jump could wander around long time getting back starting spot many times knight move average get back original square answer question going something common mathematics well abstract away specific problem place well studied structure format case something cal led chain first ingredient chain state space case state space square chessboard square cal led state second ingredient chain probability transition function tell us likely night jump one square state language chain another arrow show us corner knight one half chance jump chance jump central square show eight equally likely jump arrow similar story hold could keep filling chessboard arrow like technically every square arrow coming drew many arrow whole picture would fact thats rule probability transition function every state outgoing arrow add exactly one since arrow tell us likely knight jump one square another requirement add saying theres hundred percent chance jump ing somewhere chain simply made two thing state space probability transition function order solve problem randomly hop ping knight need learn little general chain theory help let check different example super weird radio station play two kind music k pop ka chain time next song genre song currently one third time switch es genre thats probability transition function indicate arrow want introduce stationary distribution stationary distribution assign one number state specific assign determined answer question huge number radio fraction tuned k pop fraction tuned ka randomly switch song fraction radio tuned channel case probability transition function indicate stationary distribution chain value one half k pop value one half ka thousand radio half radio theyre tuned k pop scoff next song change third k pop switch ka number switch k pop stays balanced thats make stationary distribution slightly intuitive way think following listen one radio really long time fraction song hear k pop fraction ka half half theorem stationary distribution pick state chain give generic name state x starting state x average number hop take return state x divided value stationary distribution state x kind make sense bigger stationary distribution popular state less time take return formal proof check resource description textbook first saw problem let apply theorem radio station listening k pop song long take hear another k pop song theres chance next song k pop song also possible well listen scuffle apply ing theorem see average take divided song hear another k pop song radio station decided people really like k pop change probability transition function chance stay ing k pop also probability stay scoff like stationary distribution different play two third time ka one third time apply ing theorem hearing k pop song wait less time one half song average hearing another k pop song make sense let go back night randomly hop ping around chessboard know stationary distribution time take return given state chain solve night problem order answer question average many hop take knight original square need find stationary distribution use theorem knight hop around randomly really long time fraction time expend square intuitively square center bigger fraction since theyre easier access smaller fraction compute exact number welcome pause video try figure fun challenge ready hear solution ill tell first going fill chessboard particular way square place number correspond number possible move knight make square corner square two central square eight ninth closer edge either three four six ninth many put square big claim take one random hop average number end square let look two square like theyre known chess parlance see seven six nights four nights jump randomly six nights chance jump ing average exactly one night jump similarly four nights chance jump ing average exactly one night jump mean swap night ending number star ted theres nothing special works two square nice move away square swap piece configuration night end exactly star ted collection nights close stationary distribution figure fraction nights square total number nights divide number nights square get fraction stationary distribution chain know stationary distribution apply theorem ear lier finally answer question many random hop average night take original square well figure stationary distribution original square divide get serum say divide one one hundred twelve get number move night mean take average random hop night square hopped second average amount time would take return little two minute saw ear lier sometimes return two second order average big two minute night must sometimes spend long hop pin around finding way home challenge star ted night corner instead usual square many hop would take average return another challenge start rook corner many move make average starting square leave answer comment see next week infinite series bunch great response episode exploring pi different metrics funky noted pi metrics famously irrational pi metric integer ask often pi irrational l p metrics well p vari es infinity pi take value lot value rational like three point two three point seven six two almost every number irrational precise version statement ill say pi often irrational kin ser ked possible pi equal infinity well maybe episode talking metrics linear sense want measure length way thats scaled distance two zero origin twice long distance one zero origin case pi always three four inclusive f pointed drop requirement weird thing happen theres funny metric cal led discrete metric distance two point unless theyre point distance point theres good debate comment circle might look like match make pi honestly sure theres good way make sense like curiosity creativity debate finally din ked pretty neat question whats value p pi elf key metric equal p stuff helpfully provided
