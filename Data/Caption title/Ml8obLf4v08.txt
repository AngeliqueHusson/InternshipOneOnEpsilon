alright so in this video we 're gon na doone more example using Heron 's formulaso we 're gon na find the area of thetriangle PQR given that little p haslength 18 little Q has length 21 point 6inches and angle Q is 52 degrees so touse Heron 's formula we just need to findthe length of the missing side and wecan just plug everything in and be inbusiness but to figure out the missingside well I think we 're actually gonnahave to use the law of sines a coupletimes or at least that 'll work for usbut first off to figure out you know touse the law of sines we 're given angle Qand the side opposite opposite that thelength of it we 're only given the sidelength opposite angle P so the firstthing I 'm going to do is figure out theangle P we can use that to help usfigure out the angle R then we 'll usethat to figure out the side length andthen we 'll finally be in a position towhere we can actually use Heron'sformula all right soso let 's see we could say the sine ofangle P over 18 that 's gon na equal sineof 52 degrees over twenty one point sixso all I 'm gon na do here is justmultiply both sides by 18 and we 'll getsine of P is gon na be so sine of 52degrees times 18 over twenty one pointsixlet 's see here solet 's do sign of 52бу I 'm getting sign of52 degrees to be roughly point seveneight eight we 'll multiply that byeighteen over twenty one point six sopoint seven eight eight x 18 divided bytwenty one point six I 'm getting that tobe roughly point six five seven afterrounding so now we can just do theinverse sine of both sides so we 'll getP is the inverse sine at point six fiveseven so let 's see the inverse sine ofpoint six five seven I 'm getting that tobe roughly forty one point zero sevendegrees I think I 'm just gon na roundthat off to 41 degrees so now we can goback to our triangle we know that angleP here is now 41 degrees well we can addthese together right we can do 52degrees plus 41 degrees and thenwhatever angle R is when we add allthose up we 've got to get a hundred andeighty degrees since they 're all insideof a triangle so that 's going to be 93degrees plus the angle R is 180 degreeswe can always subtract 93 and if wesubtract 93 I believe we should be leftwith 87 degrees so now really angle Rhere is 87 degrees so definitely not toscale hereand now I 'm gon na use the law signsagain to figure out this side length allright so again maybe we 'll call thislittle R so the side length little Rover sine of a T seven degrees that'sgonna equal it does n't matter which onewe use I think I 'll use the 21.6 oversine of 52 degrees now we could justmultiply both sides by sine of 87degreesso we 'll get that R equals twenty onepoint six times sine of 87 degrees oversine of 52 degrees so let 's see I thinkwe said somewhere sign of did wecalculate sine of 52 degrees we did wesaid sine of 52 degrees was 0.788 sothat 's what 's gon na go in thedenominator the point seven eight eightwe 've also got to calculate sine of 87degrees I do n't know if we did that whenI do n't think we did so sine of 87degrees I 'm getting point nine nine nineafter rounding so let 's see we 'll dotwenty one point six times 0.99 nine notgoing to change that much divided by0.788 I 'm getting this to equal twentyseven point three eight I guess inchessince we were using before so okay sowe 're getting a little bit closerI think I 'll round this off so twentyseven point three eight I 'm gon na roundthat off to twenty seven point four andnow we 've got all the side links so wecan finally use Heron 's formula toactually simply find the area so okay touse Heron 's formula we first have tofind the semi-perimetertwenty seven point four plus 18 plustwenty one point six all over two Ithink this is definitely stuff that atthe end of the day I plug all into acalculator so twenty seven point fourplus 18 plus twenty one point sixhey that 's exactly 67 on top sixty sevendivided by two is gon na be what Ibelieve thirty three point five so nowwe can just use Heron 's formula whoopsso not s but now we 're getting the areaaso it says we take 33.5 then we have totake 33.5 and just subtract away each ofthe different links so let 's see one ofthe links was twenty seven point fourthen we would have to take 33 point fiveand subtract away 18 and then we wouldhave to take thirty three point fivesubtract away the other length which wastwenty one point six squeeze all that inthere and again now it 's just just abunch of arithmetic nothing worse thanthatso thirty three point five let 's see ifwe take thirty three point five andsubtract twenty seven point four weshould just get six point one so thirtythree point five minus eighteen that'sjust going to give us fifteen point fiveand then if we do thirty three pointfive and if we subtract away twenty onepoint six that 's just gon na give useleven point nine so let 's see I 'm gonnamultiply all these together now sothirty three point fivethirty three point five times six pointone times fifteen point five timeseleven point nine getting a pretty bignumber underneath there which makessense three seven six nine two pointthree five seven five so now I 'm justgoing to square root that and it saysthe area is roughly equal to one ninetyfour point one five square inches andI 'm just going to round that off to onehundred and ninety four square inches test
