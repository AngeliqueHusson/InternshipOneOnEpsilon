JAMES GRIME : 0.That 's our friend.Yes.To a mathematician this is a number.But it was n't always obvious.ROGER BOWLEY : Math existed to do financial transactions , tosell sheep , to buy copper things , whatever.And you would use coins.And there would be values to the coins.So you would say this costs 5 pounds 20shillings , or whatever.You do n't do any trading with the number 0.I 've got no sheep here.Oh , I 'm gon na buy no sheep , I 'll give you no pounds.It does n't make any sense.So there was no need for shopkeepers toinvent the number 0.JAMES GRIME : They had the idea of 5 cows.But the idea of 5 , not so much.The idea of 5-ness they didn't quite understand.So a number like 0 , which is the absence of -- well , whatever , cows , whatever it was -- made no sense to them.I 'm going ask Brady a question.See if I can catch him out.Brady , is 0 an even number ? BRADY HARAN : I think the answer is no.But it feels like it is because it is round.JAMES GRIME : So this is an interesting -- OK , let me ask another question.Is 16 an even number ? BRADY HARAN : Yes.JAMES GRIME : Yes.So people have studied this.People have a delayed reaction.People are not sure whether 0 is an even number.Now I can tell you that 0 , categorically , is an even number.It will follow every definition of an even number.ROGER BOWLEY : So there was an Indian called Brahmagupta whoinvented the idea of nothing not being nothing but existingas an abstract quantity in the mathematics.Well , then it goes to North Africa.And there 's a guy called Al Qasimi.And he writes a book about the art of Hindu mathematics andreckoning by Hindu mathematics.And that spreads through North Africa to Spain and so forth.And it becomes , they think , Arabic numbers.So you have all the numbers plus 0.That was fine.Until 1200 when Leonardo of Pisa , also known as Fibonacci , translates this book.It 's a wonderful idea.But this is in the period of the Crusades.So people think these are Arabic numbers , not Hindunumbers because it 's come from North Africa.So the Catholic church objects to this because there areCrusades going on and this is the work of the enemy.So in Florence , for example , they banned the use of thisArabic number 0.And it was thought to be the work of the devil.BRADY HARAN : Because my definition of an even numberis something that can be divided by 2.JAMES GRIME : So Brady 's just told me an even number is anumber that can be divided by 2.Well , 0 can be divided by 2.0 divided by 2 is 0.In fact , in that sense , it is the most even number.In ancient times they had this idea of things being singlyeven or doubly even.So 12 would be doubly even because you can divide by 2and then 2 again.Well , by that sense , 0 can be divided by 2 and 2 and 2 and2 -- it is the most even number.The correct definition of an even number is it'sa multiple of 2.Something times 2.Something times 2.Well , it is.There 's no problem with that.It 's 0 times 2.Great.Brady said it had to be divisible by 2.Well , that works.0 divide by 2 is 0.OK , so it fits between two odd numbers.That might be a definition for even.Let 's do that.There 's 0.And over here that 's 1.Over here that 's minus 1.And then you get 2 over here , minus 2.Perfectly fits.There are some rules for numbers.Some arithmetic rules.Two even numbers , if you add two even numbers together , youget an even number.Well , that works.0 plus 4 is 4 , an even number again.That 's what we want.We 're saying 0 is even.It follows every definition.In fact , if it was n't even , then it would break our rulesof arithmetic , which would be a disaster.It is true to say that 0 is neither positive or negative.It sits here between the positive numbers and thenegative numbers.So it is neither positive or negative.ROGER BOWLEY : The discovery of 0 was the most importantadvance in mathematics of all , because it made mathematicscapable of being understood by everybody.Everybody could do this mathematics.JAMES GRIME : The Babylonians , the Greeks , they had the ideaof a space.So there was a difference between 26 , 2and 6 , and 206 , 2-0-6.They had a space there.They did n't use the symbol 0 , but they had a space.It was more like a punctuation mark.So the Babylonians would understand the differencebetween 26 and 206.But instead of using the symbol for 0 , they would justhave a space.However , if they wanted to write 260 , 260 waswritten like this.And to us , that looks like 26.To them and in context , that would make sense.But they did n't have this idea of 0 by itself.In the 9th century , the first instance -- or the first recorded instance of 0 -- was found.It was actually found by a gardener keeping track of thenumber of flowers that his garden would produce.And he used the number 50 as we would recognize it.5 , 0.After that point , they started to experiment with 0.What could it do ? If you add 0 , it makes no difference.If you times by 0 , you get 0.Dividing by 0 -- that caused them some problems as it still does today.ROGER BOWLEY : In this sense , the mathematical sense , thenumber 0 does not mean nothing.It means a quantity which you can manipulate in themathematics.And so it 's better to call it 0 rather than nothing.Nothing is when you're counting.There 's nothing there.0 is the abstract mathematical quantity.CGP GREY : I 'm CGP Grey and my favorite number is 0.I like 0 because it 's not an obvious number.You can have counting systems where there 's one thing , twothings , three things , four things.But mathematics existed for a long time without having a 0as part of it.So it 's a number , but it also isn'tanything in and of itself . test
