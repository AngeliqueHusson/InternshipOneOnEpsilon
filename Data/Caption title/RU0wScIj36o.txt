If you watched my video about Hilbert 's space-filling curve ... ... you might be curious to see what a few other space-filling curves look like.For each one , see if you can figure out what the pattern of construction is.This one is the Peano curve.It is the original space-filling curve.But of course , there 's no reason we should limit ourselves to filling in squares.Here 's a simple triangle-filling curve I defined in a style reflective of a Hilbert curve.This one has the most delightful name , thanks to mathmetician/programmer Bill Gosper : '' Flow Snake '' What makes this one particularly interesting is that the boundary itself is a fractal.It might become a surprise how some well-known fractals can be described with curves.This is another famous fractal.The `` Koch Snowflake '' Let 's finish things off by seeing how to turn this into a space-filling curveFirst , look at how one section of this curve is made.This pattern of four lines is the `` seed '' With each iteration , every straight line is replaced with an appropriately small copy of the seedLet 's see what happens as we change the angle in this seedA sharper angle results in a richer curveA more obtuse angle gives a sparser curveAnd as the angle approaches 0 ... We have a new space-filling curve . test
