what what is the difference between aline a line segment and a ray well theway that we write themactually not let 's make this ringall right so ladies and gentlemen theway that you can kind of think aboutthis is a line goes on infinitely inboth directions it never stopsthese arrows tell us can go implement itthis way and feeling that right thenwhat about if we just stop one side ofthe line and say you know what here 's anendpoint but we let it what we allow tocontinue in another direction that isgoing to be array and then if we containboth sides of the line with endpointsthen what we have is a line segment sogoes from line raysegment I do n't want to make a Ichickened out on the curse of us it'sbeen a while so anyways we have line rayand line segment so how do you how do welabel what a line is well remember wealways say hey it takes two points tomake a line but a line contains infinitemany points so all we need to do is justpick and choose two of the pointsthere 's infinite many points you onlyneed to same thing with the Ray now withthe thing with the Ray and I a linesegment is you are always going to begiven a end point because they have tocontain that end point right this Rayyou know you 're going to be given thisend point because that 's the point andthe line segment you always are going tohave two end points so in a line itdoes n't matter let 's just call this a bc d e f so if i was gon na name the linealright a B capital letters and I makesure I draw a line above it if I 'm gonnado ray I do C and D and I make sure I goin the direction that the Rays going ifit 's going from C to D and then itcontinues on right so you write thecontinuation going on past D then for aline segment line segment directions notreally going to matterall right ray direction does matterbecause it 's only going from C to D it'snot going D to C and continuing and itonly continues after D so array the Rayorder matters for a line though itdoes n't matter either and for a linesegment it does n't matterhowever for a ray it does so that 's ageneral difference between Ray line andline segment okay any other test
