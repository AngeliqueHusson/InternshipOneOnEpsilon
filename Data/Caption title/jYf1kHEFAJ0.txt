hello welcome section statistics last section introduce concept variance sample variance would calculate collection population variance would calculate knew every single value population large collection usually time cant calculate population variance population big equation case going lesson practice give idea wan ted calculate sample variance id say find sample variance following thing would let look change colors little bit say data set five eight seven six nine right want find want find sample variance sample variance small set sample use squared equation sum little mean square one right sum ming divide n minus case number sample bottom well minus anything know going need find mean every data point subtract ing mean well kind side right mean sample mean already done plus plus plus divided well get add top mean actually right becomes matter substituting making sure dont make mistake advice calculating variance since theres lot dont skip step write everything take time simplify simplify dont try many thing advanced probably error way write like ill open parenthesis say first point notice equation written written data point minus mean first data point five minus mean going always seven ill write minus seven square thats next point eight ill open another parenthesis say minus case mean got square guy third data point minus mean thats going squared next one going minus thats data point right final one would minus ill square end kind numerator little nugget point data point minus mean data point minus mean data point minus two mean data point subtraction square thats squaring outside parenthesis notice know know seven minus seven zero know know eight minus seven one know know figure point notice didnt addition subtraction head write large number probably gon na make error point get tired whatever teacher need able see theyre writing see exactly meant even make mistake bottom going n minus one number data lesson calculating variance statistics lesson calculating variance statistics lesson calculating variance statistics lesson calculating variance statistics lesson calculating variance statistics lesson calculating variance statistics lesson calculating variance statistics lesson calculating variance statistics lesson calculating variance statistics lesson calculating variance statistics lesson calculating variance statistics lesson calculating variance statistics lesson calculating variance statistics lesson calculating variance statistics lesson calculating variance statistics lesson calculating variance statistics lesson calculating variance statistics lesson calculating variance statistics
