let graph let say inequality less equal plus x plane want show x satisfy condition right good starting point might break less equal know graph equal plus thing thing could less plus could equal plus less equal mean sit could less equal reason first example problem know graph let graph try draw little bit thats vertical axis x axis right know intercept intercept point line know slope mean go x direction going goup going right enough draw could even go back go back x direction going go also going point line best attempt drawing line going look something like going look something like line straight think get idea right graph equal plus let think mean less point satisfy inequality point x less plus let think pick value x x equal say x equal mean going plus less x equal negative telling us times negative negative plus negative would less negative x equal telling us times plus going less let least try plot x equal let plot one first x equal less point shading satisfy right look one x less negative point x equal less point general take point x let say take point x right evaluate plus going get point line x times plus satisfy could equal point line could less going go line possible x would get point line drawn would get point line inequality essentially line plus area shaded less less equal sign would include actual line convention actually make line dashed line situation dealing less plus situation would n apply would line would n satisfied area let one like let say greater negative x minus good way start way like start graph equation right let graph fun let graph equal thing negative minus graph vertical axis horizontal axis intercept negative slope negative x negative x minus slope negative mean go right go go right going go go left go negative go negative line going look like line going look like best attempt drawing line line equal negative x minus inequality greater equal greater negative x minus greater negative x minus logic x take x let say thats particular x want evaluate negative x minus going get point right going get point line satisfy inequality going point fact draw open circle ca n include point negative x minus going greater true x take x evaluate negative negative x minus going get point satisfy satisfy equation satisfy equation entire area line going include line convention make line dashed line let draw trying best turn dashed erase section line hopefully look dashed turning solid line dashed line show boundary included satisfy inequality satisfy equality yellow stuff shading line anyway hopefully found helpful introduction graph ing two variable linear algebra khan academy introduction graph ing two variable linear algebra khan academy introduction graph ing two variable linear algebra khan academy introduction graph ing two variable linear algebra khan academy introduction graph ing two variable linear algebra khan academy introduction graph ing two variable linear algebra khan academy introduction graph ing two variable linear algebra khan academy introduction graph ing two variable linear algebra khan academy
