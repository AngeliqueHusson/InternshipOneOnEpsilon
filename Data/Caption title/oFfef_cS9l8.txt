you spend $ 45 setting up your lemonadestand right it costs you 10 cents andsupplies to make each glass you charge75 cents for each glass how many glassesof lemonade do you have to sell to breakeven so this is concept here of breakingeven let 's talk about that for a minuteso when you look at these variablesyou 've got profit which equals therevenue how much you take in minus thecost so revenue is what you take inthat 's amount of money you earn - whatyou spend to buy supplies and to set upyour stand and so forth and you 're leftover with the profit now when thebreak-even point is just when you areabout to reach the profitability you'vepaid for all your initial costs andafter that you 're going to startbecoming profitable so that 's when theprofit equals zero okay so let 's writean equation for the revenue so therevenue is what you take in that 's 75cents times X the number of glasses oflemonade that you sell now the costlet 's see you have an initial cost of $ 45 setting up your stand so that 's aone-time cost plus it costs you 10 centsprobably in lemons sugar ice water andso forth per glass so one thing thatyou 'll notice about these two equationsis if you think about the y equals MXplus B form of the line you probablylearned the slope intercept form of theline m is the slope and the B is they-intercept but when you 're doing wordproblems such as these the slope isreally the rate okay so and the B they-intercept is really the initial or thestarting amountokay the initial condition so in thiscase the initial condition here is the $ 45 that you spent that one-time fee toget your lemonade stand up and runningand then the rate is the ten cents thatit costs you each glass that you makeover here with the revenue there 's noinitial quantity for the revenue it'snot like you 're getting a one-timelump-sum you 're just getting a 10Sariah seventy five cents per each glassso that 's the rate okay that you'recharging per each glass so that helps alittle bit when you doing route problemslike this think about not the slope butthe rate and then not the y-intercept atthe starting amount or the initialamount so then all we have to do issubstitute these quantities into ourequation the revenue is 0.75 X minus thecostwhich is 45 plus 0.1 0x notice I put itin the parenthesis because we want tosubtract that whole quantity so now allwe 're gon na do is we 're gon na solve forX the number of glasses to reach thatbreakeven point so let 's go ahead anddistribute the negative here so thatgives us point seven five X minus 45minus 0.1 0 X combine like terms rightso that 's going to give us point sixfive X minus 45 equals zero we 're goingto add the 45 over here equals 0.65 Xand then we 're going to divide bothsides by 0.65 to get X by itself so I'mgoing to go to the calculator now 45divided by 0.65 45 divided by 0.65 weget sixty nine point two okay now here'sthe thing can you sell point two glassesof lemonade probably not so really toreach that break-even point we 're goingto just round this up to 70 glassesapproximately 70 glasses of lemonadeuntil you reach your break-even pointafter that you 're gon na becomeprofitable when you sell that seventyfirst glass seventy second glass and sothat etc normally those students wouldthink to themselves boom this is 0.2that 's less than five rightI would round down to 69 right but inthis case if you only solve 69 glassesof lemonade you actually have n't youknow recouped that initial cost for theforty five dollars that you had to spendto get your lemonade stand up andrunning so it 's going to take that 70thglass to basically break even and thengo into profitability so again I hopethis helped you understand how to workwith these types of word problems againthink about some of the tips that wetalked about heresubscribe to the channel check out someof my other videos on Mario 's math tutorand YouTube channeland I look forward to helping you in thefuture videos I 'll talk to you soon Profit, Revenue, and Cost Math Problem Profit, Revenue, and Cost Math Problem Profit, Revenue, and Cost Math Problem
