We 're asked to simplify r to the 2/3 s to the third , thatwhole thing squared.Times the square root of 20r to the fourth s to the fifth.Now this looks kind of daunting , but I think if wetake it step by step it should n't be too bad.So first we can look at this first expression right herewhere we 're taking this product to the second power.We know that instead we can take each of the terms in theproduct to the second power and then take the product.So this is going to be the same thing as r to the 2/3squared times s to the third squared.And now let 's look at this radical over here.We have the square root , but that 's the exact same thing asraising something to the 1/2 power.So this is equal to -- so times this part.Let me do this in a different color.This part right here , that is the same thing as 20.And instead of just writing 20 , let me write 20 as theproduct of a perfect square and a non-perfect square.So 20 is the same thing as 4 times 5.That 's the 20 part.Times r to the fourth times s to the fifth.Now let me write s to the fifth also as a product of aperfect square and a non-perfect square.r to the fourth is obviously a perfect square.Its square root is r squared.But let 's write s to the fifth in a similar way.So s to the fifth we can rewrite as s to thefourth times s.Right ? S to the fourth times s to the first , that is s to the fifth.And of course , all of this has to be raised to the 1/2 power.Now let 's simplify this even more.If we 're taking something to the 2/3 power and then to thesecond power , we can just multiply the exponents.So this term right here , we can simplify this asr to the 4/3 power.And just as a bit of review , taking something to the 4/3power , you can view it as either taking -- finding itscube root , taking it to the 1/3 power , and then taking itscube root to the fourth power.Or you can view it as taking it to the fourth power andthen finding the cube root of that.Those are both legitimate ways of something being raised tothe 4/3 power.So you have r to the 4/3 times s to the 3 times 2.Times s to the sixth power.And then we could raise each of these terms right here tothe 1/2 power.So times -- let me color code it a little bit.And we actually wouldn't need theparentheses once we do that.Times 4 to the 1/2 times 5 to the 1/2.That term right there.Times r to the fourth to the 1/2 power.Times -- I might run out of colors -- s to the fourth tothe 1/2 power.We 're raising each of these terms to that 1/2 power.Times s to the 1/2 power.There 's a lot of ways we can go with this , but the onething that might jump out is that there are some perfectsquares here and we 're raising them to the 1/2 power.We 're taking their square roots , solet 's simplify those.So this 4 to the 1/2 , that's the same thing as 2.We 're taking the principal root of 4.5 to the 1/2 ? Well , we ca n't take the square root of that , so let 's justwrite that as the square root of 5.r to the fourth to the 1/2.There 's two ways you can think about it.4 times 1/2 is 2.So this is r squared.Or you could say the square root of r tothe fourth is r squared.So this is r squared.Similarly , the square root of s to the fourth or s to the1/2 is also s squared.And then this s to the 1/2 , let 's just write that as thesquare root of s.Just like that.Let 's see what else we can do here.Let me write these other terms . We have an r to the 4/3times s to the sixth times 2 times square root of 5 times rsquared times s squared times the square root of s.Now , a couple of things we can do here.We could combine these s terms . Let 's do that.Actually , just write the 2 out front first . So let 's writethe 2 out front first . So you have 2 times.Now let 's look at these two s terms over here.We have s to the sixth times s squared.When someone says to simplify it , there 's multipleinterpretations for it.But we 'll just say s to the sixth times s squared.That 's s to the eighth.6 plus 2.Times s to the eighth power.Times -- now this one's interesting and we might wantto break it up depending on what we consider to be trulysimplified.We have r to the 4/3 times r squared.r to the 4/3 is the same thing as r to the 1 and 1/3.That 's what 4/3 is.So 1 and 1/3 plus 2 is 3 and 1/3.So we could write this times r to the 3 and 1/3.That 's a little inconsistent.Over here I 'm adding a fraction.Over here with the s I kind of left out the s to the 1/2 fromthe s 's here.But we could play around with it and all of those would bevalid expressions.So we 've already dealt with the 2.We 've already dealt with these two s's.We 've already dealt with these r's.And then you have the square root of 5 times thesquare root of s.And we could merge them if we want , but Iwo n't do it just yet.Times the square root of 5 times the square root of s.Now there 's two ways we could do it.We might not like having a fractional exponent here.And then we could break it out.Or we might want to take this guy and merge it with theeighth power.Because you know that this is the samething as s to the 1/2.So let 's do it both ways.So if we wanted to merge all of the exponents , we couldwrite this as 2 times s to the eighth times s to the 1/2.So s to the eighth and s to the 1/2.That would be 2 times s to the 8 -- I can evenwrite it as a decimal.8.5.8 plus -- you could imagine this is s to the 0.5 power.So that 's 8.5 times r to the 3 and 1/3.I 'm kind of mixing notations here.I have just a decimal notation , then I have afraction notation , mixed number notation.Times the square root of 5.This is one simplification.I kind of have it in the fewest terms possible.The other simplification if you do n't want to have thesefractional exponents out here , you could write it as -- I'lldo this in a different color.You could write this -- and these are all equivalentstatements.So it 's up to debate what simplified really means.So you could write this as 2 times s to the eighth.Instead of writing r to the 3 and 1/3 , we could write r tothe third times the cube root of r , which is the same thingas r to the 1/3.We could write r to the third times r to the 1/3.r to the 1/3 is the same thing as the cube root of r.And then you have the square root of these two guys.Both of these guys are being raised to the 1/2 power.So you could then say times the square root of 5s.I like this one a little bit more , the one on the left.To me this is really simplified.We 've merged all of the bases.We have these two numbers , we've merged all the s terms , all the r terms . This is a little bit more complicated.You have a cube root.You have n't separated the s 's and the r's.So I would go with this one if someone really wanted me -- said hey , Sal , simplify it how you like . test
