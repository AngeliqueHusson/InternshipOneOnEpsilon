We need to factor 25x to the fourth minus 30xsquared plus 9.And this looks really daunting because we have something tothe fourth power here.And then the middle term is to the second power.But there 's something about this thatmight pop out at you.And the thing that pops out at me at least is that 25 is aperfect square , x to the fourth is a perfect square , so25x to the fourth is a perfect square.And 9 is also perfect square , so maybe this is the square ofsome binomial.And to confirm it , this center term has to be two times theproduct of the terms that you're squaring on either end.Let me explain that a little bit betterSo , 25x to the fourth , that is the same thing as 5x squaredsquared , right ? So it 's a perfect square.9 is the exact same thing as , well , it could be plus orminus 3 squared.It could be either one.Now , what is 30x squared ? What happens if we take 5 times plus or minus 3 ? So remember , this needs to be two times the product ofwhat 's inside the square , or the square root of this andthe square root of that.Given that there 's a negative sign here and 5 is positive , we want to take the negative 3 , right ? That 's the only way we 're going to get a negative overthere , so let 's just try it with negative 3.So what is what is 2 times 5x squared times negative 3 ? What is this ? Well , 2 times 5x squared is 10x squared times negative 3.It is equal to negative 30x squared.We know that this is a perfect square.So we can just rewrite this as this is equal to 5x squared -- let me do it in the same color.5x squared minus 3 times 5x squared minus 3.And we saw in the last video why this works.And if you want to verify it for yourself , multiply this out.You will get 25x to the fourth minus 30x squared plus 9 .
