welcome most everyone is familiar withthe sequence of Fibonacci numbers thatgoes 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 and so oneach number in the sequence in some ofthe previous two terms for example 2plus 3 is the next term 5 3 plus 5 is856 13 there 's so much information aboutthe Fibonacci numbers out there so ifyou just search on the internet for thesequence of numbers you 'll find gobs andgobs material that will just astound youbut there are two particular puzzlesthat are sound me which are seen to berelated to the Fibonacci number so thisFibonacci it 's so in this video I 'd liketo give you these two puzzles I 'll justate them here and in my next video willactually give the answers away so thisis a video just to puzzle statementsokay first puzzle my first puzzle isabout a very strange language which Icall the language of a beaver and inthis language this only three lettersthe alphabet ever used a B and E andmost any combination of those threeletters is indeed a word in thislanguage except there 's one rule you maynever have an e immediately following ana so a followed by a then e is notallowed otherwise every othercombination lives is fine for example abe e e a is a word and a beaver and a bebe be be a e I 'm afraid that wo n't wouldbe on the info phone is not have an AEcombination there so like question iscan we count the number of n letterwords in the Bieber example how many onelittle words other than this languagewell one levels are peddled of a but Sirfact of the B but so far the d by cellso it 's 31 letter words of the beavertwo little words well I could have AAA Ican have a B but I ca n't have AE that'sthe only thing that all males are bothcould be a bee bee bee E or e a eb or EEso perfect that one restriction I nowhave eight two little words in thelanguage of Bieber you can see that howmany three little words now things get abit tedious I 'm going to go through hereon time but you can check there'sactually let 's see it going to be 21three little words in the laneBieber and this is surprising look atthe numbers 3 8 21 here 's three here'seight and here 's 21 so you mean youshould verify that I 've got this correctbecause that makes me wonder how manyfor that of words out there is it reallygoing to be 55 so my puzzle is is thenumber of an little words or call this an and the language of a beber everysecond Fibonacci number and if so whyall right that 's puzzle number one thelanguage of a beaver is it really everysecond Fibonacci number puzzle numbertwo now there 's been a greatbreakthrough in the study of partitionnumbers recently and I 'd like to do apuzzle related to those so I 'm going totalk about those ordered partitions andwhat I mean by first of what thee-petition me my pen back is the numberthree handy why where 's killer rights asthree is the sum of small less than orequal numbers 23 reserved one couldwrite it as 2 plus 1 and if all isconsidered ported like you consider itdistinct from 1 plus 2 so there 's twodifferent ordered petitions of numberthree rows are wrote one plus one plusone organs let us write three by itselfso there are four ways to partitionnumber three now in my puzzle I canimagine there 's actually two differentways throughout the number one now maybeI want to use like a red pen on the bluepen but rather have me switch pens onscreen all the time we get very confusedI 'll say there 's an an upper one drop alittle bar on top and there 's a lowertype of one so imagine is a red andgreen or something so now in ask howmany ordered partitions are there thenumber three if I 've got two differenttypes of one at my disposal all right soI can basically cop the answers aheadbefore but we 're going to have moreoptions he goes I can certainly havewhoops where 's my pen gun two plus oneusing the upper one but it also have twoplus one using the lower one I couldhave 1 plus 2 using upper one or couldhave 1 plus 2 using the lower one Isurvey the number 3 still and then I'vegot this one 1 plus 1 plus 1 he goeslots of options I can make them alllower I could make one of them upper inwhich case I 've got some choices heremiddleanother will make the first one upper orI can make two of them upper Oh what todo is getting bit boring that a littleboom or I could make all three upper sowhat 's that one two three four five sixseven eight plus nine ten eleven twelvethirteen ways to petition the numberthree if there 's two different types ofone at my disposal let 's do an easyexample how many ways to petition number2 i 'll just write to or butts off icould write one plus one but actually icould do one with both lawyers one withboth uppers or one of each so a shelooks like there 's now five ways topetition the number two ah this a littlebit easier ways petition number one likeI only write one would rather be anupper one or could be a lower one soactually two ways to position number twobut look what 's going on here 's thenumber two is the number five is another13 which makes me wonder have youordered partitions are there othernumber for using two different types ofone is it 34 in fact if P of nrepresents the number of orderedpetitions of the number end with twodifferent types of one am i againgetting every second Fibonacci numberbut this time is the other set ofFibonacci 's from the previous at Bieberpuzzle so that 's it they 're my twopuzzles do these two particular puzzlesat Bieber and ordered petitions with twodifferent types of one actually give methe Fibonacci numbers intertwined everyalternating Fibonacci number one foreach to the puzzle think about that inmy next video gear with the answers andI 'll give a giver of what I think is ajust a beautiful way to just feel boththese puzzles in one simple hit lots offun so play with us for a while
