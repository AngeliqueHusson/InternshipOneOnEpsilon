STEVE MOULD : I 'm Steve Mould.And I think we should stop using pi and start using tau.MATT PARKER : And I'm Matt Parker.And I think Steve said something ridiculous.I think pi is fantastic.It 's wonderful.And even if this was an equal race , we would 've been usingboth of them.Or even if tau had been established first , I 'm stillpretty pro-pi.STEVE MOULD : Wow , that's quite a claim.MATT PARKER : Yes , there's [ INAUDIBLE ] .STEVE MOULD : So let's talk about this.So pi is the circle constant.It 's the constant that defines a circle.And the argument is -- MATT PARKER : We're agreed so far . [ RINGING ] STEVE MOULD : Let 's think of a reasonable definition of whata circle is.The classic is all points equidistantfrom a single point.That distance is the radius.And if you 're ever doing maths using circles , you talk aboutthe radius.All your equations about circles talk about the radius.Unless you 're an engineer , you use diameter.But as a mathematician , you use the radius.The circle constant should surely be defined in terms ofthe radius . [ RINGING ] STEVE MOULD : But it is n't pi -- is the circumference divided by thediameter , which is crazy.So the circle constant should be the circumference dividedby the radius.When you do that , you get 2 times pi . [ RINGING ] STEVE MOULD : And so we 're not saying let 's redefine pi andcall it 6.28.But instead -- MATT PARKER : Wow.STEVE MOULD : -- we 're saying -- [ RINGING ] STEVE MOULD : Shut up.Instead , we 're saying that's going to be confusing , solet 's invent a new constant.And we 'll call it tau.MATT PARKER : To be honest , one of the points was quite nice , which is that if you 're an engineer , you use pi.And in fact , historically , we've used pi because when youmeasure a circle , the only direct measurement you canmake is of the diameter . [ RINGING ] MATT PARKER : And so that 's why historically we 've done that.And to this day in precision engineering we do that.And yes , you can do some very nice maths withthe radius in a circle.But the only thing you can directlymeasure is the diameter.So that 's why we 've used pi.People say , oh , but we have to put 2 pi into lots ofequations , and then blah , blah , blah.It 's always 2 pi.Why do n't we just use tau instead ? There are as many fantastic equations out there which usejust the single pi.And there 's no reason to bring in 2 pi . [ RINGING ] MATT PARKER : And so I see Steve is holding a pen.But I have brought my own.STEVE MOULD : [ CHUCKLING ] .MATT PARKER : So everyone's classic is the e to the i pijob , where e to the i pi plus 1 equals 0 . [ RINGING ] MATT PARKER : And that is using a solitary piout the front there.And if you want to go wild , things likethe area of a torus -- this is a nice one -- that equals pi squared -- [ RINGING ] MATT PARKER : -- outside the major radius squared minus theminor radius squared.So I 'm still doing things in terms ofradiuses or radii or whatever.But the pi squared -- that 's lovely.What -- you want 4 ? I mean , how you are going to -- STEVE MOULD : Yeah , I want -- MATT PARKER : Tau squared on 4 ? STEVE MOULD : What -- yeah , absolutely -- tau squared on 4.And I 'll explain why.And this is important.OK , let 's just say that Matt has cherry-picked a couple ofnice equations there.Two things I 'd say -- let 's look at , for example , the areaof a circle.So we 're looking at the area pi r squared.MATT PARKER : That's just lovely.Look at that . [ RINGING ] STEVE MOULD : Yeah , OK -- but here 's the problem.Here 's the problem.If we reframe that in tau , that wouldbe tau by 2 r squared.And you think , OK , that's less beautiful.But this tells us something important . [ RINGING ] STEVE MOULD : This tells us something.This is information that you're obscuring by using pi.Because you can derive the area -- MATT PARKER : By simplifying your -- [ RINGING ] STEVE MOULD : No , listen.You can derive the area of a circle by integrating . [ RINGING ] STEVE MOULD : So you say , OK , here 's our full circle.Let 's look at the area of this little strip where the widthof it is delta r.And this is r going up.And so this is full r or whatever.So you integrate.The area of this is pi r dr.MATT PARKER : Tau.STEVE MOULD : No , but -- sorry , tau , yeah , actually . [ RINGING ] MATT PARKER : See , pi's just easier to use.STEVE MOULD : Shut up.And then you end up with 1/2 tau r squared . [ RINGING ] STEVE MOULD : And so that 1/2 tells you something.It tells you you 've done an integration to get there . [ RINGING ] STEVE MOULD : And an equation like this obscures it.Similarly , with this , if you had tau squared over 4 , thatwould tell you something.This equation here -- let's just reframe that.e to the i tau minus 1 equals 0 . [ RINGING ] STEVE MOULD : And the great thing is that is a fullcircle , right ? If you want to go through half a circle , then it 's e to the itau over 2.If you want to go a quarter of a circle , it 's e tothe i tau by 4 . [ RINGING ] STEVE MOULD : The pi is confusing.It 's especially confusing for children whenthey 're learning as well.A full circle is 2 pi ? OK , so that half a circle is pi.A quarter of a circle is pi by 2.So there 's always this factor of 2 -- [ RINGING ] STEVE MOULD : -- that you 've got to keep in your mind whenyou 're doing calculations.And actually , if you 're a seasoned mathematician , you'reprobably always thinking in terms of 2 pi , anyway . [ RINGING ] STEVE MOULD : And so let 's just stop thinking in terms of 2 piand start thinking in terms of tau.MATT PARKER : This is the hypocrisies of tau.You want halves here.You do n't want halves over there . [ RINGING ] STEVE MOULD : I want halves here because the half tellsyou something . [ RINGING ] MATT PARKER : This works out just as nicely.Because if you want to integrate , and you 've got your2 pi r dr , then you get a wonderfulthing you can simplify.Because you end up with this -- r squared -- STEVE MOULD : Yeah , so in this particular case -- MATT PARKER : -- and you end up with a -- [ RINGING ] STEVE MOULD : So in this particular case -- MATT PARKER : -- 2 pi and the 1/2 simplifies . [ RINGING ] STEVE MOULD : Yeah , yeah.MATT PARKER : Pi r -- that 's just -- there 's nowhere else in maths where you say , you know what ? Let 's not simplify it.Let 's leave it in a more complicated form because it -- STEVE MOULD : No , but in fact , this is the one case where youthink , actually it 's useful to have a 2 there because we cancancel later.Most other cases you do n't get to do that cancel becauseyou 're not dividing by 2 later on . [ RINGING ] STEVE MOULD : In most cases , you end up with an equationthat 's got 2 pi in it.BRADY HARAN : A lot of smart people , who I know yourespect -- and I know you respect the guysitting next to you -- STEVE MOULD : [ CHUCKLING ] .BRADY HARAN : -- make the case -- STEVE MOULD : That 's correct.MATT PARKER : Professionally.BRADY HARAN : A lot of smart people make the case for tau.MATT PARKER : Yeah.BRADY HARAN : How do you explain their reasoning ? How do you -- I mean , you do n't think Steve 's an idiot.But he has this feeling about tau that you disagree with.What 's different about his thinking to yours ? MATT PARKER : You know what ? A lot of people do have very good arguments for tau.And a lot of people have very good arguments for pi.And there is a wonderful thing -- I do n't know.I think people like the fact that it 's different and thatthey 're going , oh , whoa , whoa , whoa -- everyoneelse has got it wrong.We can change this.And tau is better.And oh , people try and do maths and theythink pi 's all that.No , they 're wrong.But I do n't think there 's any great advantage other than itcan be a bit more exclusive to say , oh , we 're all over tau -- [ RINGING ] MATT PARKER : -- when I think pi works justas well in all cases.It 's got the -- I know -- historical -- the fact that it 's got a bit of heritage does n't mean weshould keep it around necessarily.But it 's worked for a very long time.And it 's there for very good reasons . [ RINGING ] MATT PARKER : Nothing people have thrown at me in terms oftau , saying it 's better -- you gain as much as you lose from -- [ RINGING ] MATT PARKER : -- switching from -- both of them have theirdisadvantages and their advantages . [ RINGING ] MATT PARKER : I do n't think there 's enough for an entireoverhaul of the subject because people think , oh , what , this particular equation looks a bit nicer.Oh , but we 've lost the fact that you get negative numbersin Euler 's identity.And even your arguments with circles -- this is my clincher.This is why I genuinely think pi is nicer.If you 've got tau , right ? If you do tau radians -- you do an entire revolution -- you end up right back where you started.Tau gets you nowhere , right ? [ RINGING ] STEVE MOULD : [ CHUCKLING ] .MATT PARKER : With pi , if you do pi radians , you actuallyget somewhere.And I think if you want a unit to measure things , the unitshould n't be the whole thing . [ RINGING ] STEVE MOULD : What ? [ LAUGHING ] .MATT PARKER : A unit should be a section of it.And so it 's more nuanced.And for that reason -- STEVE MOULD : Oh , then in that case -- MATT PARKER : I think pi is better.STEVE MOULD : -- divide it by -- you know -- 360 . [ RINGING ] MATT PARKER : Now you've just gone too far.No one would use that kind of a unit.BRADY HARAN : Steve -- STEVE MOULD : Yeah.BRADY HARAN : I 've heard you talk a little bit.And you seem to have an enjoyment of the history ofmathematics.Maths is beautiful and pure.But it 's also got great stories.STEVE MOULD : Yeah.BRADY HARAN : Why are you willing to ditch pi , which isone of our most important clinged-to , loved stories ? MATT PARKER : Do n't overstate my case here , all right ? STEVE MOULD : One word -- progress . [ RINGING ] STEVE MOULD : The historical point is a good one . [ RINGING ] STEVE MOULD : Historically , we used to sacrifice goats . [ RINGING ] STEVE MOULD : And I think we should keep doing that.No -- so you ca n't just cling to something because of history.Having said that , one argument against tau is that pi is verywell established.And we 'll just never replace it . [ RINGING ] STEVE MOULD : The strong argument for me is that tau ismore intuitive.And so from an educational point of view -- [ RINGING ] STEVE MOULD : -- in terms of understanding circles andworking with circles , tau makes more sense.MATT PARKER : Maybe just call it a circle.BRADY HARAN : OK , Steve -- MATT PARKER : When you 're trying to teach kids angles , and you go , what angle is this ? All of it . [ RINGING ] MATT PARKER : That 's just all the way round.STEVE MOULD : But then you start dealing with radians.MATT PARKER : And then you get half the circle.It 's called a circle.BRADY HARAN : Steve , if I made you education minister of theworld tomorrow , what would you do about this situation ? STEVE MOULD : Well , here 's the thing.I think you can actually slowly bring it in.Because you can use pi and tau at the same time . [ RINGING ] STEVE MOULD : Because wherever you see 2 pi , you can write tau.So you do n't have to change any -- you do n't have to suddenly overhaul textbooks andredefine pi.You can bring it in slowly.And so if I was education minister of the world -- and Ihope to be one day -- you can bring it in very slowly.BRADY HARAN : Matt , your argument seems to be that thetau people are n't wrong.It 's just a bit needless.It 's extra work -- MATT PARKER : They're insufficiently right . [ RINGING ] STEVE MOULD : [ LAUGHING ] .BRADY HARAN : So what 's wrong with education minister forthe world there next to you slowly bringing in tau ? MATT PARKER : I have no problem with tau sitting alongside pi . [ RINGING ] MATT PARKER : I have no problem with -- I think it 's very important -- you 're right -- to teachradians in terms of it 's a whole circle , and we'resplitting it up into smaller amounts , and how it links towonderful things like this.But you never see anyone who's plugging tau in and going , youknow what , this would be useful as well.They 're always like , pi is wrong.And I 'm like , well , pi is not wrong.STEVE MOULD : Pi is not wrong.No , I know.MATT PARKER : It 's perfectly serviceable.It 's worked a treat.And it 's a wonderful concept.And I think genuinely it 's got a lot more going for it fordoing maths than tau.But there 's many things where you could say historically -- like , why do n't we count in base 12 ? That would be nicer.But we don't.We count in base 10 , which , I admit , I would almost say base12 has more advantages if we switch to that than if weswitch to tau . [ RINGING ] MATT PARKER : So why are we getting so emotional about ourirrationals when we could be a bit more rational about ourbase systems ? BRADY HARAN : I 'm stopping the tape beforeyou both start talking.MALE SPEAKER : 4.8 kilograms -- MALE SPEAKER : So we define angles counterclockwise -- MALE SPEAKER : -- of order -- MALE SPEAKER : -- so we go that way rather than that way.Quite why we do that , I have no idea.It 's convention.MALE SPEAKER : And similarly , if I went up , say , to the sizeof a boulder , so that this was -- test
