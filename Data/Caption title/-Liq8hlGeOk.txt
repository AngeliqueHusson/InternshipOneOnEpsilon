it 's 10,000 584 divisible by 8 to knowthe answer we divide 10,000 584 by 8 ifwe get the remainder as 0 we know that10,000 584 will be divisible by 8 and ifit is nonzero then it is not divisibleby 8 8 multiplied by 1 is 8 we subtract8 from 10 to get 2 then we get the nextdigit down 5 8 multiplied by 3 is 24 wesubtract to get a 1 here we get it downto boring we are taking too long to findout if this number is divisible by 8there is a way in which we could haveanswered this question in 5 seconds yesdo n't be surprised in this video we willlook at a few divisibility rules theserules will help us know if a big numberis divisible by another number and yeswithin 5 seconds before we move on tothe shortcuts we need to know somethingabout the number 0 any number multipliedby 0 results in a 0 transposing anynumber to the other side we can say that0 divided by any number will result in a0 what does this tell us it tells usthat the number 0 is divisible by anynonzero number now let 's move on to afew divisibility rules first let 's lookat divisibility by 2 how can you tell ifa number is divisible by 2 withoutperforming any division here 's thesimple rule well a number is divisibleby 2 if the last digit that is theunit 's digit of that number is divisibleby 2 what does that mean let 's look at acouple of examples to see how easy it isto find out if the number is divisibleby 2 here 's your first number 980 2356is this number divisible by 2 to answerthis quickly we just need to look at thelast digitthe last digit is six and since six isdivisible by two the entire number isdivisible by two nine hundred and eightytwo thousand three hundred and fifty sixis divisible by two here 's the secondnumber ten million nine hundred andeighty seven thousand six hundred andfifty nine is this number divisible bytwo pause the video and try it out isthis number divisible by two the unit'sdigit of this number is nine is ninedivisible by two no and that is why thisnumber is also not divisible by twothat 's how simple it gets withdivisibility rules imagine how much timeit would have taken you to manuallydivide these two numbers by two and seeif the remainders are zero or not nowlet 's move on to the second ruledivisibility by four how can we quicklytell if a number is divisible by four itis pretty similar to the divisibilitytest of two a number is divisible byfour if the number formed by the lasttwo digits is divisible by four in thiscase it is the last two digits in thecase of divisibility test of two we justhad to look at the last digit so is onemillion nine hundred and eighty seventhousand six hundred and thirty twodivisible by four as its divisibility byfour we need to look at the last twodigits the number formed by the last twodigits is 32 is 32 divisible by four yesso this big number is also divisible byfour here 's the next one is 97 billionfour hundred and thirty two thousand onehundred divisible by four what are thelast two digits here zero and zero thenumber formed by the last two digits iszero and we learnt that zero isdivisible by any number hence thisnumber is also divisible by four and nowwe come to thedivisibility rule of this sessiondivisibility by eight a number isdivisible by 8 if the numbers formed bythe last three digits is divisible by 8yes numbers formed by the last threedigits look at the number 16 millionnine hundred ninety eight thousand andforty eight is it divisible by 8 thelast three digits are 0 for 8 the numberformed by the last three digits is 48and 48 is divisible by 8 so this hugenumber will also be divisible by 8 1 therules simple for a number to be exactlydivisible by 2 its last digit should bedivisible by 2 to be exactly divisibleby 4 the number formed by the last twodigits should be divisible by 4 and tobe exactly divisible by 8 the numberformed by the last three digits shouldbe divisible by 8 we will cover a fewmore divisibility rules in the nextsessionyou test
