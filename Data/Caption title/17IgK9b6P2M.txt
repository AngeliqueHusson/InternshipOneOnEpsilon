Now that you know that fractions are special numbers written like division problems , we¡¯re going to learn about some different types of fractions , and where they¡¯re located on the number line.Because fractions are division problems , their value depends on the top and bottom numbers and the relationship between them.There are a few basic rules about that relationship that will help us estimate the value of a fractionand know about where it should be on the number line.The first rule is : If the top number of a fraction is zero , then the value of the fraction is always zero , no matter what the bottom number is.For example , zero over two and zero over twenty-thousand are both just zero.I like to call these fractions , ¡°zero fractions¡± ¡­ ya know¡­ cuz they equal zero.Oh.. and by the way¡­ you can never have zero as the bottom number of a fractionbecause you can¡¯t divide something into zero parts , so don¡¯t even try it.The next rule is this : If the bottom number is bigger than the top numberthen the value of the fraction will be greater than zero but less than one.That means it¡¯ll be somewhere in this section of the number line.Any fractions that have values in this range are called ¡®Proper Fractions¡¯because we can use these values to represent smaller parts of things.Our third rule is this : If the top number and the bottom number are the same , then the value of the fraction is always just one.So , whether you have one over one , five over five or one-hundred over one-hundred , the value is always just one.I¡¯m going to call this kind of fraction a ¡°whole fraction¡± because its value represents one-whole.Oh¡­ and in case you¡¯re wondering , this rule doesn¡¯t apply to zero over zero , because like I told you , having a zero on the bottom of a fraction is a big no-no.Okay , our last rule is this : If the top number is greater than the bottom number , then the value of the fraction will be bigger than one.That means it¡¯ll be somewhere in this section of the number line , which goes on forever.These are called ¡®Improper Fractions¡¯ , because even though they¡¯re written like regular fractions , since their value is greater than one , they aren¡¯t really used to represent smaller parts of things.Alright , these rules show that we have four main types of fractions : We have ¡®zero fractions¡¯ , ¡®proper fractions¡¯ , ¡®whole fractions¡¯ , and ¡®improper fractions¡¯.Knowing that these main types are in order from smallest to largest on the number lineallows you to do some very simple comparisons between the four types of fractions.That¡¯s because we know that a zero fraction is always less than a proper fraction , and a proper fraction is always less than a whole fraction , and a whole fraction is always less than an improper fraction.Let¡¯s do a few comparisons to get the hang of it¡­Here we have 1/5 and 0/8 : Since 1/5 is a proper fraction and 0/8 is a zero fraction,1/5 is greater than 0/8Now let¡¯s do 3/8 and 2/2:3/8 is a proper fraction and 2/2 is a whole fraction , so that means that 3/8 is less than 2/2Now what about 9/9 and 32/32 ? Ah¡­ now that¡¯s easy.Since they are both whole fractions , and whole fractions are always equal to one , these fractions are equal.And finally , what about 1/2 and 5/4 ? Now we know that 1/2 is a proper fraction , but 5/4 is an improper fraction because its top number is bigger that its bottom number.So that means that 1/2 is less than 5/4.Now that we know that there are four basic types of fractions , and we¡¯ve learned where they fit on the number line , let¡¯s learn more about how the relationship between the top and bottom numbers effects the value of a fraction.Let¡¯s go on a journey down our number line.Now we¡¯re gon na start with this ¡®zero fraction¡¯ ( zero over twenty ) and its value puts us here at zero on the number line.To get moving , all we have to do is start changing the value of our fraction by increasing the top number.We¡¯re going to leave the bottom number the same the whole time though.Alright ! Let¡¯s go ! We haven¡¯t gotten very far from zero yet , and you might have noticed that the top number is still very small compared to the bottom number.But , as the top number gets bigger , the value of our fraction is increasing.That tells us that if a fraction¡¯s top number is a lot smaller than its bottom number , then its value is going to be close to zero . ¡­in this part of the number line.Look at this¡­ we¡¯re almost to ten on top , and since ten is half of twenty , we¡¯re almost to one-half on the number line.It¡¯s pretty easy to figure out what half of something , or double of something is , and we can use that to help us compare fractions.¡­like we know that 9 over 20 is going to be really close to 1/2 on our number line.Alright , so we¡¯ve passed one-half now , and we¡¯re making our way to the number ¡®1¡¯.Notice that our top number keeps increasing , and it¡¯s getting closer and closer to twenty.In fact , when it reaches 20 , we¡¯ll have arrived at ' 1 ' because twenty over twenty is a whole fraction.Knowing this can also help you estimate a fraction¡¯s value.Whenever you see a fraction with a top and bottom number that are almost the same¡­ like 19 over 20 , you know that the value is close to ¡®1¡¯.There , we¡¯ve passed ¡®1¡¯ now , but we¡¯re still going and our top number is now bigger than our bottom number , which means we have an improper fraction.You can see that the bigger the number gets , the bigger the value of the fraction , and we could keep on going forever and ever , but that might take all day ! [ laughter ] Okay , so our journey showed us some pretty useful regions of the number line : ¡­the region near zero , where the top number is much smaller than the bottom number.¡­the region near one-half , where the top number is about one-half of the bottom number.¡­the region near ¡®1¡¯ , where the top number and bottom number are about the same.¡­and the region past ¡®1¡¯ where the top number is bigger than the bottom number , and it keeps on going forever.Knowing about these regions can sometimes help you quickly estimate the value of some fractions.For example , you can estimate that 1 over 16 is going to be pretty small . ¡­close to zero on the number line.And you can estimate that 29 over 31 is going to be almost ¡®1¡¯because there is not much difference between the top and bottom numbers.And if you have the fraction 14 over 30 , you can estimate that it¡¯ll be about one-half since 14 is close to 15 and 15 is half of 30.Alright , that wraps up this section , and I hope it¡¯s helped you understand the different types of fractions and where they are on the number line.You¡¯ll understand even better if you do the exercises for this section.Good luck and I¡¯ll see you next time.Learn more at www.mathantics.com test
