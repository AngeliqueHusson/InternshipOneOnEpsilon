We already know that 2 to the fourth powercan be viewed as starting with a 1and then multiplying it by 2 four times.So let me do that.So times 2 , times 2 , times 2 , times 2.And that will give us , let's see , 2 times 2 is 4 , 8 , 16.So that will give us 16.Now I will ask you a more interesting question.What do you think 2 to the negative 4 power is ? And I encourage you to pause the video and think about that.Well , you might be tempted to say , oh maybeit 's negative 16 or something like that , but remember what the exponent operation is trying to do.One way of viewing it is this is telling ushow many times are we going to multiply 2 times negative 1 ? But here we 're going to multiply negative 4 times.Well , what does negative traditionally mean ? Negative traditionally means the opposite.So here this is how many times you 're going to multiply.Maybe when we make it negative this says , how many times are we going to , startingwith the 1 , how many times are we going to divide by 2 ? So let 's think about that a little bit.So this could be viewed as 1 times , and we 're going to divide by 2 four times.Well , dividing by 2 is the same thing as multiplying by 1/2.So we could say that this is 1 times 1/2 , times -- let me just do it in one color.So 1 times 1/2 , times 1/2 , times 1/2 , times 1/2.Notice multiplying by 1/2 four timesis the exact same thing as dividing by 2 four times.And in this situation this would get you , well 1/2 , well 1 times 1/2 half is just 1/2 , times 1/2 is 1/4 , times 1/2 is 1/8 , times 1/2 is 1/16.And so you probably see the relationship here.If you 're -- this is essentially you 're starting with the 1and you 're dividing by 2 four times.You could also say that 2 -- I'm going to do the same colors -- 2to the negative 4 is the same thing as 1/2to the fourth power . Let me color code it nicely so yourealize what the negative is doing.So this negative right over here -- let me do that in a better color , I 'll do it in magenta , something that jumps out.So this negative right over here , thisis what 's causing us to go one over.So 2 to the negative 4 is the same thing , based on the way we've defined it just up right here , as reciprocal of 2 to the fourth , or 1 over 2to the fourth.And so you could view this as being 1/2 times 2 times 2 times2 , if you just view 2 to the fourthas taking four 2's and multiplying them.Or if you use this idea right over here , you could view it as starting with a 1and multiplying it by 2 four times.Either way , you are going to get 1/16 . So let 's do a few more examples of thisjust so that we make sure things are clear to us.So let 's try 3 to the negative third power.So remember , whenever you see that negative , what my brain always does is say Ineed to take the reciprocal here.So this is going to be equal to , I'mgoing to highlight the negative again , this is going to be 1 over 3 to the third power . Which would be equal to 1/3 times 3 times 3 , or 1 times3 times 3 times 3 , is going to be 27.So this is going to be 1/27.Let 's try another example , I 'll do two or three more.So let 's take a negative number to a negative exponent , justto see if we can confuse ourselves.So let 's take the number negative 4 , and let 's take it -- I do n't want my numbers to get too big toofast.So let 's just take negative 2 and let'stake it to the negative 3 power.I 'll make my negatives in magenta , negative 3 power . So at first this might be daunting , do the negatives cancel ? And that will just be the remnants in your brainthat are trying to think of multiplying negatives.Do not apply that here.Remember , you see a negative exponent , that just means the reciprocal of the positive exponent.So 1 over negative 2 to the third power , to the positive third power.And this is equal to 1 over negative 2 timesnegative 2 times negative 2.Or you could view it as 1 times negative 2 timesnegative 2 times negative 2 , whichis going to give you 1 over negative 8 or negative 1/8.Let me scroll over a little bit , Ido n't want to have to start squishing things.So this is equal to negative 1/8.Let 's do one more example , just in an attemptto confuse ourselves.Let 's take 5/8 and raise this to the negative 2 power.So once again , this negative , oh I got at a fractionis a negative here.Remember this just means 1 over 5/8 to the second power.So this is just going to be the same thingas 1 over 5/8 squared , which is goingto be the same thing -- so this is going to be equal to -- I'mtrying to color code it , 1 over 5/8 times 5/8 , which is 25/64 . 1 over 25/64 is just going to be 64/25 . So another way to think about it is , you 're going to take the reciprocal of thisand raise it to the positive exponent.So another way you could have thought about thisis 5/8 to the negative 2 power.Let me just take the reciprocal of this , 8/5and raise it to the positive 2 power.So all of these statements are equivalent.And that would have applied even whenyou 're dealing with non-fractions as your baseright over here.So 2 , you could say well this is going to be the same thing.2 to the negative 4 is going to bethe same thing as taking my reciprocal.So this is going to be the same thingas taking the reciprocal of 2 , which is 1/2and raising it to the positive 4 power . test
