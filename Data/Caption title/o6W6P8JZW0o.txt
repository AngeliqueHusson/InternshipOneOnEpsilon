So if you 're like me , you probablydo n't carry around a protractor everywhere you go.And even if you do , sometimes youwant to have only the angle you want.Because you needed a whole bunch without all those other degreesgetting in the way.This is the need that the angle-a-tron fulfills.A protractor is kind of like a 180-degree angle-a-tron.It 's great at 180 degrees.You can make your own 180-degree angle-a-tron super easilyfrom any piece of paper.Even if your paper does n't have an edge , you can just fold it.And tada , angle-a-tron.One extremely useful angle-a-tronis the 90-degree angle-a-tron.Many pieces of paper come pre-equipped with one of these.But if they do n't , you can get oneby folding a 180-degree angle-a-tron in half.Now you can draw all sorts of rectangly thingsand perpendicularities.Following the fold-stuff-in-half method , you can get a 45-degree angle-a-tron pretty easily.Or a 22.5 degrees.Or 11.25 , and so on.And you get these weird looking numbers.But that 's only because we started with somethingarbitrary , like 360 degrees.When really the numbers we 're looking atare 1/2 , 1/4 , 1/8 , 1/16 , you know 1/2 to the n.It 's not hard to fold paper into thirds either.Might take a little evening out , then bam , 180 degreestuns into 60 degrees.Good for making equilateral triangles.Or put two together to get 120 degrees.A very common and useful angle for when , say , bubbles meet.If you 're drawing bubbles or honeycombs or something.Then you can start adding them together.135 degrees is easy.90 degrees plus 45 degrees.Now , you can make puzzles for yourself.Say you make a 60-degree angle-a-tronand a 135-degree angle-a-tron.How do you make an angle-a-tron that completes the circle ? Or if a friend gives you an angle-a-tron , can you make the complementary or supplementary -- I forgetwhich is which -- angle-a-tron ? And then , let me know if this is going a little too far.Maybe you can put an angle-a-tronon your angle-a-tron.And now I have a 60 degrees and another 60 degrees , which comes over here to make another 60 degrees.And I 've got an equilateral triangle polygon-a-tron.And just in case you thought that was n't going too far , why not make that into a polyhedron-a-tron ?
