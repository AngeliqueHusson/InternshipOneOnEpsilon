DR JAMES GRIME : We did a video.I 'd done it some time ago about Mersenne primes.And offhandedly , just off the cuff , I saidthat 1 was n't a prime.Now , if I 'm honest , we do n't say 1 is prime.There 's a special reason for that.And we noticed that some people in the comments said , well , I think I 've heard of this before , but why is that ? Why is n't 1 a prime ? So what is a prime number ? Let 's think of the definition.You probably know the definition.A prime number is a number that can only be divided by 1and itself.So the prime numbers are 2 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 11 , 13.You know these numbers.So it sounds like 1 should be a prime number , right ? It fits the definition of the prime number.You can divide by 1 , and you can divide byitself , which is 1.And historically , it was considered a prime number.So if you 're thinking , hmm , it sounds like it should be.Well , that 's what they used to think.That 's what mathematicians used to think as well.But in the end , they had to exclude itfrom the prime numbers.Oh poor old 1 , 1 is the loneliest number , theloneliest number you 'll ever do.So it 's excluded for a reason.There 's a really important theorem in mathematics.It 's called the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic.Now , it says that every positive whole number can bewritten as a product by multiplying prime numbers.So here it is.I did n't want to write it out , so here it is.Every positive whole number , or integer , if you like , canbe written as a unique product of primes.So you can tell this is an important theorem because ithas a name.And you can tell it 's a very important theorem because ithas a pompous name.So what this means is prime numbers are our atoms , likeatoms in chemistry.They can be used to make other numbers by multiplying theseprimes together.So for example , 15 is 3 times 5.3 and 5 are prime.And you can make 15 from multiplying primes together.But there 's a very important word here in this theorem.Look at this word , unique.Now that 's not just there for decoration.Every word is important , unique.It has to be a unique product.There 's only one way to do it.Now we know , of course , that 15 is also 5 times 3.We do n't mind that , that 's allowed.We do n't mind that.What we do n't like is that 15 is 1 times 3 times 5.Not only that , but it 's also 1 times 1 times 3 times 5.And it 's 1 times 1 times 1 times 3 times 5 , and so on.If 1 was a prime , then we would n't have a unique way ofwriting 15 as a product of prime numbers.So what this meant was , when they used to think it wasprime , they had to keepexcluding 1 from your theorems.You would have to keep saying , take all the prime numbers , except for 1.And we just got tired of doing that.So we just decided to exclude 1 from our definition of primeto begin with.So 1 is n't a prime number.It is n't considered a composite number , where youmake the other numbers from primes.No , it has a category all of its own , where it sits , alllonely by itself.BRADY HARAN : But why does this mean 1 's not prime ? Maybe it 's just a stupid theorem.Maybe the theorem 's no good.Why does the theorem beat number 1 out ? DR JAMES GRIME : We have a choice.We have a choice to include it in that categoryif we wanted to.Prime 's just a word , it's just a category.And it 's more useful for us to say , take this list , which isthe list of all the primes.And it does n't have 1 on it.It 's more useful to say , take this list.And that list is 2 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 11 , blah , blah , blah.BRADY HARAN : Looking at that theorem , does n't that meanthat 1 is n't a whole number because 1 , surely 1 ca n't bemade as a unique product of primes ? DR JAMES GRIME : OK.Well , let 's have a look.Let 's take -- I 'll start with 16.16 is a product of primes because it 's 2 times 2times 2 times 2.It 's four primes.8 is a product of primes.It 's 2 times 2 times 2.So I 've just divided by 2 there.4 is a product of two primes.The number 2 , the prime number 2 , is a product of just oneprime number.And then if I divide by 2 again , I get 1 , which is theproduct of zero prime numbers.It 's called an empty product.So we 've got a product of 4 primes , 3 primes , 2 primes , continue the pattern , 1 prime , and 0 primes.It 's 1 , and it 's not 0.It 's 1 , it 's called an empty product . Oh , that wo n't be it for the number 1.We 'll be hearing from the number 1 again soon , I 'm sure . test
