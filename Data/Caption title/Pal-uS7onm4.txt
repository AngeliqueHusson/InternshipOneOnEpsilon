let us consider first video try find union two event formula consider two considered intersection event even number event b number greater pick one see event satisfied probability union b equal basically mean either occur occur together formula say equal probability event happening plus probability event b happening minus probability event b happening together know probability also know probability b subtract actually p intersection b let us write event b first event even number would event b greater would equal listen next part carefully add b add carbon case since consider number common part subtract p intersection b understand better probability happening probability event b happening greater subtract part answer probability intersection bis three ten let repeat since common twice part need common union b need equal equal good way analyze event b see occur twice since need remove set left union b equal seven form union b either greater even greater simply number part least one event possible probability union b equal probability plus probability b minus probability intersection b interesting question think could chance may need subtract let think bit yes bare mutually exclusive occur together p intersection b would equal formula would p union b equal p plus p b remember b probability union example probability union example probability union example probability union example probability union example probability union example probability union example
