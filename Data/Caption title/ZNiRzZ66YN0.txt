[ MUSIC PLAYING ] My goal is to not actually do any measurementsother than using pie.So the entire thing is going to pie based.We get the circumference in the exact number of pies -- give or take -- we get the diameter in number of pies.Divide one by the other , we get pi . [ MUSIC PLAYING ] Pi was historically rarely calculated this way , becauseit 's notoriously inaccurate to try and get -- I know , we 're idiots -- it's notoriously inaccurate to tryand calculate pi by measuring a circle . [ MUSIC PLAYING ] To get any kind of accuracy on our final answer we have to beas precise as we can be . [ MUSIC PLAYING ] This is a mild problem , because I want to go from thevery edge of the circle.But as you can see , I've positioned all the piesexactly on the line as if they 're little mini tangents.So I 'm going to have to move these two out and then I canstart doing the diameter exactly on the circumferencethere , like that . [ MUSIC PLAYING ] So that 's 84 and 1/3.264 and 2/3 pies around , we have the diameter , is 84 and 1/3 pie.To get pi , we just divide the circumference by the diameter.OK , and if we actually work out what that is , it equals -- that 's pretty good.Pi from pies , we got 3.13834 , which is approximately 3.14.So using pies , we've got pi to be 3.14.I am a very happy man right now.With the diameter , and if I know that ratio , I can justmeasure the diameter.That 's the easy bit to measure.The center point will be my pen , and theoutside will be the chalk.So the pies , in theory , are a fairly consistent size.So they 're all -- yeah they 're about the same.OK .
