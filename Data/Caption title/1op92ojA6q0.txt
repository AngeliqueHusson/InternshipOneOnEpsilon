In which quadrant is the point negative 7 comma 7 located ? So let 's just review what a quadrant is.A quadrant are each of the four sectionsof the coordinate plane.And when we talk about the sections , we 're talking about the sections as divided by the coordinateaxes.So this right here is the x-axis and this up-down axisis the y-axis.And you can see it divides a coordinate planeinto four sections.We call each of these sections quadrants.This one over here , where both the x-values and the y-valuesare positive , we call the first quadrant.And we use the Roman numeral I.Then if we kind of move counterclockwisearound the coordinate plane , this quadrant wherethe x-values are negative and the y-values are positive , we call this the second quadrant.I could write it.We call this the second quadrant.Then we go down here where both the x-values are negativeand the y-values are negative.We call this the third quadrant , once againusing Roman numerals.Then finally the quadrant where the x-values are positivebut the y-values are negative , wecall this the fourth quadrant.So let 's see which quadrant the point negative 7 comma7 is located.So there 's two ways to think about it.You could just say , look , we have a negative x-value.Our x-value is negative , so we'regoing to move to the left.So we 're going to be on this side.We 're going to be on this side right hereof the coordinate plane.Just by the fact that the x-value is negative , we 're going to be either in the second or the third quadrant.Now , we know that the y-value is positive.We know that the y-value is positive.So if the x-value is negative and the y-value is positive , we 're going to land someplace right over herein the second quadrant.The other way to think about it is youcould literally just plot this pointand see that it falls in the second quadrant.So let 's do that.If x is negative 7.So that 's negative 1 , negative 2 , negative 3 , negative 4 , negative 5 , negative 6 , negative 7.Did I do that right ? 1 , 2 , 3 4 , 5 , 6 , 7.So this is x is negative 7.And then we have to go up 7 because yis equal to positive 7.So 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 7.So the point negative 7 comma 7 is right over here , clearly lies in the second quadrant . test
