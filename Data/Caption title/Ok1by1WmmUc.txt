Okay , hours of fun to be had working out the codes for different numbers in a two-one machine.But then , I had a flash of insight.I realized , instead of doing a two-one machine , I could do a three-one machine.Whoa.So now three dots in the box will explode to become one dot , one place to the left.So what do the codes for numbers look like in a three-one machine ? Let 's find out.Put in one dot , zoom , not very exciting , one dot.Put in a second dot , zoom , still not very exciting.We need three dots to explode.I 've only got two so the code for two is still two.Put a third dot however , here it comes , zoom.Three dots in the box explode¡ª ka-thwack ! To become one dot one place to the left.So the code for three is nothing , nothing , nothing , one dot , zero dots.One , zero.Ah-ha ! Four , right most box , zoom.Fine , that 's one one.Five , zoom¡ª one , two.Six might be exciting.Can you see what the code for six is going to be ? Here it comes.Zoom.Three dots in a box , ka-zooble.Ka-thwack.Three dots became one.The code for six is now nothing , nothing , nothing , two dots , zero dots , two zero.Grand.Your turn.What 's the code for thirteen in a three-one machine ? And again , I 've skipped some numbers , how annoying of me.Can you figure it out ? I 'll give the answer away in a later video but try for now.Again , hours of fun working out codes of numbers in a three-one machine.Whoa ! test
