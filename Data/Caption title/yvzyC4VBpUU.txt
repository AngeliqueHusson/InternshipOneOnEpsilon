I have the complex number 3 minus 4i.I 've plotted it on the complex plane.We see that the real part is 3 , so we 've gone 3along the horizontal axis , or the real axis.And the imaginary part is negative 4 , so we 've gone down 4 along the vertical axis.So this right here is the point 3 minus 4i.Now what I want to think about iswhat the absolute value of 3 minus 4i is.And just as a reminder , absolute value literallymeans -- whether we 're talking about a complex numberor a real number , it literally just means distance awayfrom 0.So the absolute value of 3 minus 4iis going to be the distance between 0 , between the origin on the complex plane , and that point , and the point 3 minus 4i.So this distance right over here isgoing to be the absolute value of 3 minus 4i.So how can we think about that ? Well , we could literally just set up a right triangleand then use the Pythagorean theorem.So let 's think about it.If we wanted to set up a right triangle , the height here , the distance between 0 and negative 4 , well , that distance is going to be 4.And then the base of this triangle , the distance between 0 and 3 , is just going to be 3.And this is definitely a right angle.This is a horizontal line.This is a vertical line.We can now use the Pythagorean theorem to figure outthe absolute value of 3 minus 4i.The distance between this point and 0 -- it 's the hypotenuse of this right triangle.So we just use the Pythagorean theorem.This side squared , 3 squared , plus this side squared , plus 4 squared , is going to be equal to the absolute valueof 3 minus 4i squared , the absolute value squared.So 3 squared plus 4 squared , that 's 9 plus 16 , which is 25.So you get 25 is equal to the absolute value of 3 minus 4isquared.And we know if you take the absolute value of something , this is just a distance.It 's going to be positive.So we want to take the positive square root , the principal square root , of both sides of this.And so we 're going to be left with -- well , the principal square root , the positive square root of 25 , is 5 , is equal to the absolute value of 3 minus 4i.So another way of saying it , this thing right over hereis going to be equal to 5.This distance right over here is equal to 5.Now , without having to draw it , one wayyou could just think about this is I 'll have my real part.I have my imaginary part.I could literally take each of those parts , square them , take the sum , and take the square root.So another way of taking it , if youdid n't want to visualize all this -- but thisis really what we 're doing.You could say , well , this is justgoing to be equal to take the real part squared.Take the imaginary part squared -- so let me write this.Add them together , and then take the square root , or the principal root.The principal root 's just the positive square root.So that 's going to be the square root of 9plus 16 , which , once again , is equal to 5 . test
