okay in this video we 'll do one moreexample of multiplying and dividingcomplex numbers that are given to us inpolar form and actually not quitebecause the bottom one is n't going to begiven to us in polar form well thenumerator of the bottom problem so we'vegot three plus 3i over cosine of 90degrees plus I sine of 90 degrees sorecall we can write a number in polarform we can write Z equals R cosine oftheta plus I sine theta to get Rremember we just take the real part andsquare it and add to that the imaginarypart squared then we square root that sofor three plus three I went ahead andgraphed that real quick so there 's a our3 plus 3i well to get our R value wewould simply take three squared plusthree squared well that 's going to be 9plus 9 or 18 if we can always write 18as 9 times 2 we can pull the square rootof 9 out as a 3 so we would be left with3 root 2 for our value for R to figureout our value for theta hereI just think about making a little righttriangle well the adjacent side is link3 the height is also link 3 the oppositeside so it says tangent of theta wouldjust be the opposite over the adjacent 43 over 1 excuse me 3 over 3 which givesus 1 and tangent of 45 degrees is goingto equal 1 so let 's see I think we canrewrite the numerator now it says thiswould be the same thing as our R valueagain which we said is 3 root 2 so wehave 3 root 2 times cosine of the anglewhich we said is 45 degrees so cosine of45 degrees plus I times sine of 45degreesokay that 's all over we can even writethis as one times cosine of 90 degreesplus I sine of 90 degrees but now we'veseen from the other examples all we doagain when we 're dividing we simplydivide the r1 by the r2 and then wesubtract the angles so in this case ifwe take 3 root 2 over 1 we 'll just beleft with 3 times the square root of 2and then we just have cosine of 45degrees minus 90 degrees plus I timessine of 45 degrees minus 90 degrees andat that point we basically got oursolution so we can always clean it up alittle bit more 3 root 2 this will becosine of negative 45 degrees plus Isine of negative 45 degrees and I thinkI would stop leave it there we need onemore set of parenthesis now I 'll leaveit there and now we 've got the polarform for our new number after we performthe division Complex Numbers: Multiplying and Dividing in Polar Form, Ex 2 Complex Numbers: Multiplying and Dividing in Polar Form, Ex 2 Complex Numbers: Multiplying and Dividing in Polar Form, Ex 2
