algebra and symbols in algebra are likea foreign language they all meansomething and can be translated back andforth here are a few symbols you shouldknow an expression is any combination ofvalues and operations that can be usedto show how things belong together andcompare to one another here 's an exampleof an expression a term such as 4 XY isa grouping of one or more factors whichcould be variables numbers or bothmultiplication is the only thingconnecting the number with the variablesaddition and subtraction on the otherhand separate terms from one another forexample this expression has three termsan equation uses a sign to show arelationship that two things are equalby using an equation tough problems arereduced to easier problems and simpleranswers an operation is an actionperformed upon one or two numbers toproduce a resulting number operationsare addition subtraction multiplicationdivision square roots and so on avariable is a letter that alwaysrepresents a number but it varies untilit 's written in either an equation or aninequality that 's a comparison of twovalues then the fate of the variable isset it can be solved for and its valuebecomes the solution of the equation aconstant is a value or number that neverchanges in an equation it 's constantlythe same the number five is a constantbecause it is what it is a variable canbe constant if it is assigned a definitevalue usually a variable representing aconstant is one of the first letters inthe alphabet so in the equation axsquared plus BX plus C equals zero a Band C are constants and the X is thevariable the value of X depends on whata B and C are assigned to be an exponentis a small number written slightly aboveand to the right of a variable or numbersuch as 2 in the expression 3 squaredit 's used to show repeatedmultiplication an exponent is alsocalled the power of the valueto simplify means to combine all thatcan be combined cut down on the numberof terms and put in aneasy-to-understand form to factor meansto change two or more terms to just oneterm and to solve means to find theanswer in algebra it means to figure outwhat the variable stands foryou test
