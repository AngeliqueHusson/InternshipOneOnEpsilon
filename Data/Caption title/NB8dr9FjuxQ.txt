hi this is pressure Locker the seasonfinale for the Simpsons contained abunch of cool math examples and I wantedto discuss them in this video theculmination of the episode is thefollowing math problem in the shape ofthe M drawing three straight linesconstruct nine non-overlapping trianglesthis is actually a pretty difficultpuzzle I pause the episode and actuallyspend 15 minutes trying to solve it Iwas able to get up to three four fivesix pretty easily but then I got toseven and eight and I could n't figureout how to get nine non-overlappingtriangles so I suggest you try thispuzzle and if you solve itcongratulations you can pause the videoor you can just keep watching I 'm goingto go through the rest of the mathexamples in the episode the episodestarts off with a very mathematical jokethe Springfield math team has t-shirtsthat say pi is not equal to a over Bwhich of course refers to the fact thatpi is irrational there 's also a cornymath joke here when you solve theexpression and read it out loud you geta very corny joke the math competitionfeatures a bunch of different questionsthis question tests whether you know theorder of operations the correct answerof negative 27 is shown in the episodeanother question test converting setnotation into interval notation this canbe done without a problemyou just make sure you have the closedbrackets on negative 3 & 4 here Lisa hasto solve an equation of x squared plus ysquared equals 17 plus 2x and also Xminus 1 squared plus y minus 8 squaredequals 34 this could be solvedgraphically you could draw out the graphfor the equations and you would have theintersection of two circles so we'relooking for two points to solve thissystem of equationsthe quicker way to solve itto use algebra we can rearrange thefirst expression moving 2x over to theleft-hand side and then expand out thesecond equation and now we can seethere 's a bunch of cancellations if wesubtract the first equation from thesecond equation we 'll have x squaredminus 2x + y squared all cancel out weend up with 16 y is equal to 48 whichgives us Y is equal to 3 we can thensubstitute that back into our secondequation so we 'll have X minus 1 squared+ substituting in y equals 3 in thesecond equation we 'll end up solvingvery easily that the two solutions arenegative 2 3 & 4 3 here Bart sees theproblem of x times the root of X isequal to X you actually do n't need to domuch to solve this equation verycommonly math competitions the answersof 0 or 1 are very common they clearlysolve this equation there will be noother solutions here we have anotherquestion that tests the order ofoperations substituting in x equals 7 wefirst evaluate the bracket of 3 plus 52so we have 55 over 4 and then wesubtract 7 plus 1 so we end up with theanswer of five point seven five here wehave another system of equations whichlooks difficult to solve we have a plusB squared equals 25 and a minus Bsquared equals 45 so what 's the value ofa squared plus B squaredyou might try and solve for a and B andthen you need to square a and square Bbut in math competitions there 's alwaysa trick if you expand out the twoequations we see the only difference isone has a positive factor of two a B andthe second equation has a negativefactor of two a B so if we add the twoequations together we end up with two asquared plus two B squared equals 70 nowwe can solve for a squared plus Bsquaredby dividing the equation in half so weget the answer of 35 here we haveanother system of equations which lookslike you 'll have to solve for x solvefor y and then evaluate 3x plus 5y onceagain there is a trick if you add up thetwo equations you 'll get 6x plus 10yequals 12 then divide this in half andyou get 3x plus 5y equals 6 alright nowwe will return to the puzzle we need tofind to get 9 non-overlapping trianglesdrawing only 3 straight lines so let'sdraw this figure em out so we have morespace to work with the first line wewant to draw will be skewed coming fromthe bottom left and one intersect allthe other lines we 'll draw another lineexactly symmetrical starting from thebottom right now we have one final lineto draw and we 'll draw it horizontallyand now we 've created ninenon-overlapping triangles 1 2 3 4 5 6 78 and 9 so it 's a pretty coolconstruction I hope you figured it outcongratulations if he figured out I didnot come up with this answer in theepisode of Bart magically comes up withthe answer because he looks at homershead of course his hair is in the shapeof the M and he imagines the solution byconstructing it looking at his at homershead so it 's a very cool episode I hopeyou liked this video please subscribe tomy channel I make videos on math andgame theory you can catch me on my blogmind your decisions which you can alsofollow on Facebook Google+
