are two triangles congruent we know thatall the corresponding angles have to becongruent and all the threecorresponding sides also have to becongruent but to find out if they arecongruent do we need to compare all sixelements of each triangle three sidesand three angles do we need to know allof them not necessarily to know if twotriangles are congruent we do not needto compare all six elements of eachtriangle there are a few conditions thatwill help us to know if two trianglesare congruent the first one is calledthe triple-s congruence condition whereS stands for side two triangles arecongruent if three sides of one triangleare respectively equal to the threesides of the other triangle what doesthis exactly mean let 's move to a newpage to understand we need to constructa triangle with sides three five andseven centimeters it would looksomething like thisthree five and seven now let 's constructanother triangle with sides three fiveand seven centimeters this is how itwould shape out three five and sevencentimeters these two triangles willsurely be congruent if you tryconstructing them in your notebook youwill see that they will be of the sameshape and size that 's your Triple Scondition if three sides of a triangleare respectively equal to the threesides of another triangle the triangleswill surely be congruentseems obvious huh then here 's aninteresting question for you will theTriple A congruence condition work thenhas been asked to construct a trianglewith the measure of the angles as 45 45and 90 degrees Triple A simply meansthat three angles of each triangle aregiven so he draws a triangle which lookslike this the measures of the angles are45 45 and 90 degreesand then Zara was us to construct atriangle with the measures of the anglesas 45 45 and 90 degrees the samemeasures as the angles of the previoustriangle so Zara construct a trianglelike this the angles measuring 45 45 and90 degrees are the triangles congruentwe can clearly see that their sizes aredifferent which means they are notcongruent so the triple a condition forcongruence may or may not work it couldhave worked because there was a chancethat Zara would have drawn the exactsame triangle as ends but the triple-scondition will always work we will lookat more conditions that will always workin the coming videos What is the SSS Condition for Congruence?
