Deirdre is working with a function that contains thefollowing points.These are the x values , these are y values.They ask us , is this function linear or non-linear ? So linear functions , the way to tell them is for any givenchange in x , is the change in y always goingto be the same value.For example , for any one-step change in x , is the change iny always going to be 3 ? Is it always going to be 5 ? If it 's always going to be the same value , you 're dealingwith a linear function.If for each change in x -- so over here x is always changingby 1 , so since x is always changing by 1 , the change iny 's have to always be the same.If they 're not , then we 're dealing witha non-linear function.We can actually show that plotting out.If the changes in x -- we're going by different values , ifthis went from 1 to 2 and then 2 to 4 -- what you 'd want todo , then , is divide the change in y by the change in x , andthat should always be a constant.In fact , let me write that down.If something is linear , then the change in y over thechange in x always constant.Now , in this example , the change in x'sare always 1 , right ? We go from 1 to 2 , 2 to 3 , 3 to 4 , 4 to 5.So in this example , the change in x is always going to be 1.So in order for this function to be linear , our change in yneeds to be constant because we 're just going to take thatand divide it by 1.So let 's see if our change in y is constant.When we go from 11 to 14 , we go up by 3.When we go from 14 to 19 , we go up by 5 , so I already seethat it is not constant.We did n't go up by 3 this time , we went up by 5.And here , we go up by 7.And here , we 're going up by 9.So we 're actually going up by increasing amounts , so we'redefinitely dealing with a non-linear function.And we can see that if we graph it out.So let me draw -- I 'll do a rough graph here.So let me make that my vertical axis , my y-axis.And we go all the way up to 35.So I 'll just do 10 , 20 , 30.Actually , I can it do a little bit more granularly than that.I could do 5 , 10 , 15 , 20 , 25 , 30 , and then 35.And then our values go 1 through 5.I 'll do it on this axis right here.They 're not obviously the exact same scale , so I 'll do1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , and 5.So let 's plot these points.So the first point is 1 , 11 , when x is 1 , y is 11.This is our x-axis.When x is 1 , y is 11 , that's right about there.When x is 2 , y is 14 , that's right about there.When x is 3 , y is 19 , right about there.When x is 4 , y is 26 , right about there.And then finally , when x is 5 , y is 35 , right up there.So you can immediately see that this is nottracing out a line.If this was a linear function , then all the points would beon a line that looks something like that.That 's why it 's called a linear function.In this case , it 's not , it 's non-linear.The rate of increase as x changes is going up . test
