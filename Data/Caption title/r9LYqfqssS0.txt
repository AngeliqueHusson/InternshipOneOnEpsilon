all right in this video I 'm going to doanother example of solving a rationalequation and again things are kind ofnicely set up because both sides arealready a single fraction we do n't havelarge powers of X and you know if thepowers of X are larger again typically alot of times you 're going to try tofactor and cancel out anything that youcan so if the exponents are largerthere 's just typically more factoring toworry about but in this case thingsare n't too bad so again the first thingI try to do is factor you know thenumerator the denominator you know thinkof anything is going to cancel out soagain notice in the top left I couldfactor out a 6 I 've got X minus 1 over Xminus 1 and then on the right side Icould factor the 4 out of the numeratorI think I would have a 3 X plus 1 inparenthesis I have 2 X plus 1 in thedenominator but since it 's not exactlythe same we would not be able to cancelout anything so I 'm just going to leaveit alone for the time being so again Ican cancel out my X minus 1 and my Xminus 1 and again you could think thatyou have 6 over 1 left on the left sideso we have 12 X plus 4over 2x plus one and now I 'm going to dothe same thing as in some of the otherexamples which is to cross multiply soagain I take the top left times thebottom right the bottom left times thetop right again I you know you need toput the 2x plus 1 in parenthesis becausewe 're going to have to distribute it outyou know maybe as a force of habit it'sgood to put the 12x plus 4 inparentheses as well but certainly you'remultiplying it by 1 so that 's not goingto change its value so we have todistribute out 6 times 2x + 6 timespositive 1 6 times 2x is going to giveus 12x and then a positive 6 on theright side if you multiply it out youget 12x + 4 so now I 'm going to try todo the same thing as beforeyou know I 'm going to try to put my X'son the same side I 'm going to try to putmy numbers on the same side and if youthink about this this line right now youknow there 's something wrong so butanyway just suppose mechanically we'rejust grinding through it not reallythinking too much about it which iscertainly what I do at times shouldn'tdo that you know you do n't want to be arobot but it is good to be mechanicalyou want to know the steps so I 'm simplygoing to subtract 12x from both sideswell if I subtract 12x from the leftside notice 12x minus 12x cancel leftcancels out we 're just left with apositive 6 on the right side the 12x isalso canceled out and we 've got positive4 left over so huh so now we 've got astatement that says 6 equals 4 well notin my book 6 does n't equal 4 so there'sclearly something logically wrong andand the idea is when you get a kind of anonsense statement like this it says onenumber is equal to some other numberthat it 's clearly not equal to what it'strying to tell you is it says thatthere 's a fact no solutionto this original equation so there 's novalue of X there 's no number that youcan plug in to the left side do all thearithmetic plug that same value of Xinto the right side do all thearithmetic and get two numbers that areexactly the same it 's just simply notpossible so this brings up another pointas well you know I think in algebraclass you 're always told to solve solvesolve so I 'll solve and you always get asolution not every equation has asolution so this is something that youshould keep in mind because it'scertainly something that that doeshappen not all the time but frequentlyenough to where you know again if you doget one it kind of these nonsensestatements you want to recognize oh youknow all that it you know you 've doneeverything right it just simply meansthat there 's no solution to thatparticular problem Solving a Rational Equation - Ex 4 Solving a Rational Equation - Ex 4 Solving a Rational Equation - Ex 4
