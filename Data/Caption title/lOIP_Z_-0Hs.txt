Say you 're me and you 're in math class , and you 're doodling flowery petally things.If you want something with lots of overlapping petals , you 're probably following a loose sort of rulethat goes something like this.Add new petals where there's gaps between old petals.You can try doing this precisely.Start with some number of petals , say five , then add another layer in between.But the next layer , you have to add 10 , then the next has 20.The inconvenient part of this is that youhave to finish a layer before everything is even.Ideally , you 'd have a rule that justlets you add petals until you get bored.Now imagine you're a plant , and youwant to grow in a way that spreads outyour leaves to catch the most possible sunlight.Unfortunately , and I hope I 'm notpresuming too much in thinking that , as a plant , you 're not very smart.You do n't know how to add number to create a series , you do n't know geometry and proportions , and ca n't draw spirals , or rectangles , or slug cats.But maybe you could follow one simple rule.Botanists have noticed that plantsseem to be fairly consistent whenit comes to the angle between one leaf and the next.So let 's see what you could do with that.So you grow your first leaf , and if you did n't change angleat all , then the next leaf you growwould be directly above it.So that 's no good , because it blocksall the light or something.You can go 180 degrees , to have the next leaf directlyopposite , which seems ideal.Only once you go 180 again , the third leafis right over the first.In fact , any fraction of a circlewith a whole number as a base is goingto have complete overlap after that number of turns.And unlike when you're doodling , as a plantyou 're not smart enough to see you 've gone all the way aroundand now should switch to adding things in between.If you try and postpone the overlapby making the fraction really small , you just get a ton of overlap in the beginning , and waste all this space , which is completely disastrous.Or maybe other fractions are good.The kind that position leaves in a star like pattern.It will be a while before it overlaps , and the leaves will be more evenly spaced in the meantime.But what if there were a fraction thatnever completely overlapped ? For any rational fraction , eventually the star will close.But what if you used an irrational number ? The kind of number that can't be expressed as a whole numberratio.What if you used the most irrational number ? If you think it sounds weird to say one irrational number ismore irrational than another , well , youmight want to become a number theorist.If you are a number theorist , youmight tell us that phi is the most irrational number.Or you might say , that 's like saying , of all the integers,1 is the integer-iest.Or you might disagree completely.But anyway , phi.It 's more than 1 , but less than 2 , more than 3/2 , less than 5/3.Greater than 8/5 , but 13/8 is too big.21/13 is just a little too small , and 34/21 is even closer , but too big , and so on.Each pair of adjacent Fibonacci numberscreates a ratio that gets closer and closerto Phi as the numbers increase.Those are the same numbers on the sides of these squares.Now stop being a number theorist , and start being a plant again.You put your first leaf somewhere , and the second leafat an angle , which is one Phi-th of a circle.Which depending on whether you'regoing one way or the other , could be about 222.5 degrees , or about 137.5.Great , your second leaf is pretty far from the first , gets lots of space in the sun.And now let 's add the next one a Phi-th of the circle away.And again , and again.You can see how new leaves tend to pop upin the spaces left between old leaves , but it never quite fills things evenly.So there 's always room for one more leaf , without having to do a whole new layer.It 's very practical and as a plant you probably like this.It would also be a good way to give lots of roomto seed pods and petals and stuff.As a plant that follows this scheme , you 'd be at an advantage.Where do spirals come in ? Let 's doodle a pinecone using this same method.By the way , you can make your own phi angle-a-tronby dog-earing a corner of your notebook.If you folded it so the edges of the line -- You have 45 degrees plus 90 , which is 135.Pretty close to 137.5.If you 're careful , you can slip in a couple more degrees.Detach your angle-a-tron and you 're good to go.Add each new pine cone-y thing a phi angle around , and make them a little farther out each time.Which you can keep track of by markingthe distance on your angle-a-tron.Check it out ! The spirals form by themselves.And if we count the number of arms , look it 's five and eight.If you 're wondering why spirals would form , and why always with Fibonacci numbers , you could morph back into a number theorist , or a geometeror something.But here 's just a little bit of intuition.One simple way to do a flower is to startwith a certain number of petals , say five.And when you go back around , add the next layerclose to the first , but bigger.Each layer adds five new petals and the five arms spiral out.Looks pretty spiral-ey to me.Now go back to phi.You put out three petals before you go back around.And if I make them really wide , the next lapadds three petals that overlap a bunch with the first , and so on.If I started with skinnier petals though , the second time you go around it does n't quite overlap so much.And it takes eight petals before it goes around twiceand they overlap enough for you to see the spirals.So this time I get 8 and 13.I mean none of the spirals are actually physically thereon any of these plants , it 's just the plant bitsare close enough that you can see the pattern.So all the plant needs to do to get awesome Fibonaccinumbers of spirals , is add new bits at 137.5 degree angles.The rest takes care of itself.That the Fibonacci series is in so many thingsreally says less about those things , and more about mathematics.I mean that 's what mathematics is all about.Simple rules , complex consequences.A process so easy that even a plant can do it , can turn into these amazing structures all around us.Just like a few simple postulatescan give us an incredibly powerful geometry.I mean that 's all assuming that a plant can do it.But measuring the angles between plant bits , you can see they obviously do do it , somehow.I mean , it 's not like they have angle-trons , but plants have been around a long time , and have had a lot of practice , so that probablyexplains everything.And so we always get spirals of 5 and 8 on this flower , 5 and 8on this artichoke , 5 and 8 on this pine cone , even this cauliflower has 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 -- um , anyway , we always get 1 , 2 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 -- Huh.And 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ? It 's easy to dismiss these as mutant anomalies , but just because they're different and unusual , does n't mean we should ignore them.4 ? 7 ? 11 ? What could these numbers mean ? Maybe things are n't as simple as I thought . test
