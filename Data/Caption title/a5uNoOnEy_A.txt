video going couple warm problem see require maybe little bit weve done previous video well word problem times w plus minus w equal see solve like thing theres multiple ways solve ill solve way seem natural meso one thing like like distribute distribute get subtract w maybe merge w term plus rewrite plus times distributive plus minus w equal wrote part right distributed like tal ked merge subtract w take two term get something take away something something plus equal want get rid ill equaling something able divide get rid subtract sides equation ill pink minus subtract ing sides equation something equal something something minus going equal something minus one side youve got whole point two cancel left left side equal minus thats negative divide sides equation equivalent multiplying get w equal let see negative see place simplify see divisible also doesnt look divisible look like done problem verify actually let verify kind let verify answer times negative thats solution w plus going write plus thing right minus w w negative subtract ing negative positive right let see becomes times let see negative plus negative plus see get get times let go times plus negative right plus become becomes equal exactly equal equal got right answer spider sense wrong correctly even though got strange looking answer let problem like distribute dont distribute theres multiple ways maybe well ways first way like distribute dont deal get minus distributed equal plus want get together get together left hand let get rid right hand side best way get rid subtract right hand side doit left hand side well subtract ing sides left hand side minus equal course minus equal minus disappear cancel left theres multiple ways could mean one fun thing well let traditional way could add sides disappear left hand left two guy cancel equal plus sides get x equal divide numerator denominator get said theres multiple ways problem let another way orange times x minus equal plus see see divide sides equation divide side divide get becomes times x minus equal x plus point want could distribute becomes minus equal x plus could subtract x sides equation get minus equal sides right hand side could add sides equation get equal plus sides get x equal went little bit faster really wan ted show long legitimate operation going get answer could check verify indeed correct answer word see tackle sum money split equal let say amount money split equal let say money split equal part money high interest bank much invest high interest bank divided equal high interest bank account took money divided put could say took money put high interest bank account add value thats much originally put high interest banking account rest inheritance plus stock market much rest inheritance put high interest bank account whats left whats going money going invest stock market right combine plus money didnt put put rest inheritance plus stock market lost much put much put right end check ing account added value star ted money added plus let say times amount money put times money much end original amount put account plus original amount grew added value stock market star ted plus lost money lose times plus much lose market lose amount money end say two account end exact amount money much inherit going end equal well solve let get plus well let see thing write times equal equal want color orange equal plus thing let write equal equal rewrite right plus minus times plus thats hairy problem well take step step see bad right let add something plus something well thing right multiply numerator denominator add plus equal let simplify little bit plus negative get negative mand negative times minus simplify even left hand side still equal coefficient could view minus take care term term minus thats plus let numerator denominator becomes whole equation equal minus thats plus getting close getting let get term onto side equation let subtract sides right hand side cancel right hand side equal left hand side minus equal minus thing minus right multiply numerator denominator equal almost nice meaty problem almost minus right left equal multiply sides times inverse times cancel get equal ill get calculator equal times divided equal much star ted hopefully found fun ex distributive property simplify linear equation algebra khan academy ex distributive property simplify linear
