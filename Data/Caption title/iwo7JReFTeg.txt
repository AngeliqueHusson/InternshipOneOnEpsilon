so idea of building a Mobius bridge nowone problem is that if you make a bandyou 're supposed to walk on that bandacross the bridge and that band slowlyturns well at the end of the bridgeyou 're falling into the water that 's nogood righthowever if you make your band kind of across-section at like a crescent andthen you can move that crustash you knowthrough 180 degree and you still have aplace to stand on from one end to theother so basically you can kind of lookdown this pathways and as you walkacross and you 're nice and on thehorizontal surface you simply find thatthat crescent rotates around you andfirst you have your ball on the righthand side and then you have it on yourleft hand side but you can still walkacross straight and then you simplycomplete the loop over the top and makesure that in doing so the whole thingcloses up on itself so it forms anoverall Mobius band and the hallmark ofthe Mobius band is you start on thisside and you walk around and you walkaround on the inside you walk around onthe inside and you 're suddenly on theother side on that top loop this is easyl would certainly function like a breakright cool well it 's just one of severalpossible designs here is a Mobius bandyou can see it has this one twist andthis is very simple it basically you'rewalking on this pretty much flat surfaceand then the twistactually happens on the return path andit essentially turns vertical and thatallows you to essentially support thatparticular bridge or if you do n't wantto use as a structural support thatsupports from below you could flip thisthing over and use it that way okay andnow you 're walking on the silver surfacehere but now of course you have a tunnelso your structural support but thatmight be aesthetically more interestingor more pleasing so I think anothertotally practical way of building aMobius bridge I 'm surprised people I'mbuilding ladies they brilliant maybethey do you know of anyone buildingthese there was one built not too longago in Bristol and you have to look alittle bit but yeah replicas will checkit outso they 're supposed to have you I'veonly I 've seen pictures of it so but itlooks like it 's an honest-to-god Moebiusbridge even though it 's kind of aflamboyant return path that makes mostof the twisting and it 's sort of ahorizontal loop like that I think a moreelegant and really structural simpleMobius bridge would be this one hereagain we can look and you can see verywalk through every drive through that isvery simple straight pathways so all themobis twists essentially happens in thatloop over the top you can see as theflat bands that forms the rod bit goesup over the top it makes a 180 degreeflip and comes back to the other sideand that makes a perfect verticallyoriented arch that is strong enough soit can act as a suspension bridge so Ican actually hang the roadway you knowfrom the vertical arch that is orientedin the right way to give you maximalstrengthwhat about Mobius houses yes yeahthey 're coming up so I claim both ofthese are Mobius houses now what'shappening with all the color let 's lookat this one firstis it a Mobius band well we have to kindof start up here we 're running downthere we 're running around the bottomwe 're coming up the other side and yesindeed we 're on the other side so thattells us this is indeed a Mobius banddoes it make a practical house oh Ithink we orient it like that there arehouses are slanted like the towers inMadrid for instance right so there'snothing novel there it probably wouldhave to either run the elevator at anangle which you can certainly do is aspecial track so the question is okayall the green stuffmaybe windows and you have a lot of goodoffice space and you know maybeapartments and the like that have youknow perfect views but then down here tobe consistent the green stuff is on topwell what does that mean well that'swhere you put your Lobby that 's where weput your cafeteria that 's what put yourlibrary and they all want skylights onthe top of the flat part at the bottomand we essentially have a glass ceilingand it nicely transitions into thevertical part of the glass which givesyou the ordinary beamthat you might find in your office or inyour apartment here is another veryobvious Mobius band same idea we havevery straight very conventional you knowa building block you know always maybethree four stories worth of apartmentsor hotel rooms or whatever and then muchlarger flat part along the bottom justas beforethat 's very might have in all thelobbies and the restaurants and themeeting rooms and ballrooms and libraryand stuff like that so again I think inboth of these instances these are Mobiusbuildings that really there 's no doubtthat they 're Mobius bands and they'revery practical and from what I 've seenby famous architects kind of thinkingabout mobis houses it 's it 's a much lessobvious how they might function and forme it was not always obvious to even seethat there indeed are Mobiusconfigurations one of these things yougot to get a grant and get them outwell somehow this does n't want to comesee you at this thingokay if you do that then it still hangstogether it seems to be like one bandactually it 's a band that goes aroundthe loop twice and seems to be somewhatintertwined test
