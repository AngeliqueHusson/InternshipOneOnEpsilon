Hi and welcome to Math Antics.In this video we¡¯re gon na learn how to do multi-digit subtraction.It¡¯s similar to doing multi-digit addition like we learned in our last video , but there¡¯s a few important differences.The main difference is , with subtraction the order of the problem matters.With addition , you can switch the order of the numbers you¡¯re adding and you¡¯ll still get the same answer.5 + 2 = 7 and 2 + 5 = 7.But with subtraction , if you have the problem 5 minus 2 , you¡¯ll get 3.But you CAN¡¯T switch the problem around . You won¡¯t get the same answer if you try to do 2 minus 5 instead.In fact , you¡¯ll probably get confused because you¡¯ll be trying to subtract a bigger number from a smaller one.With multi-digit subtraction , it¡¯s important to remember that order matters , especially when you¡¯re re-writing your problem.Often you will be given a problem like this ( 38 - 25 ) and you¡¯ll have to re-write it with the numbers stacked up like we did with addition.But you have to make sure that the first number , the one you¡¯re taking FROM , goes on topand the number you are taking AWAY is on the bottom.Another hint is that the bigger number should always be on top.Okay , let¡¯s go ahead and try this problem.We¡¯ve got 38 on top and 25 below it , and the ones places are lined up , just like they should be.Now we draw our line so our answer can go below it , and we write a minus sign over here on the left to show that we¡¯re subtracting.Now we can start getting our answer . And just like with addition , we ALWAYS start with the ones place column.Here we subtract the bottom number from the top:8 - 5 = 3 So the ¡®3¡¯ goes in the ones place of our answer.Now we move to the next place column to the left , the tens place.There we have 3 - 2 which is 1.There , we just subtracted 25 from 38 and found out that the difference is 13.Alright , let¡¯s see another example : 135 - 27Ah-ha , this is where multi-digit subtraction can get a little tricky.Let¡¯s re-write our problem : 135 on top , 27 below it , with the ones places lined up neatly , and our answer line and subtraction symbol in place.There¡­ now we can start subtracting.Uh-oh ! Look at this¡­ In our ones place column , the digit on top is smaller than the digit on the bottom.How can we subtract a bigger digit from a smaller one ? Did we make some kind of mistake ? No , we wrote our problem correctly¡­ the bigger number is on top.Sometimes this just happens¡­ the top digit might be smaller than the bottom digit , so you can¡¯t subtract it¡­unless¡­ you borrow ! Here¡¯s how borrowing works¡­The top digit is 5 , but the digit below it wants to take 7 away.¡°Sorry , I don¡¯t have 7 , I only have 5.¡±¡°Well , what about your neighbor ? He¡¯s in a bigger number place¡­ he¡¯s loaded ! So you can just borrow from him.¡±¡°Excuse me , I¡¯ve got a little problem¡­ do you happen to have something I could borrow ? ¡±¡°Why of course . Here you go ! ¡±Great , that ¡®1¡¯ will help . But if you just add 1 to 5 , you 'd get 6.But fortunately , this ¡®1¡¯ came from the next number place and it really represents a 10.And when we add 10 to 5 we get 15 which is big enough.Now , instead of this column being 5 - 7 , it¡¯s 15 - 7 and 15 - 7 = 8.Okay , we¡¯ve got the first digit of our answer.Now we can move on to the next column . But remember , we borrowed from that number place.It used to be a ¡®3¡¯ , but now it¡¯s a ¡®2¡¯ . It went down by 1 because we borrowed from it.Well , remember¡­ we really borrowed 10 , because it was in the next number place , but it¡¯s sometimes easier to just think of it as borrowing a ¡®1¡¯ and getting to stick that ¡®1¡¯ in front of the digit that needed to borrow.So in the tens place , we have 2 minus 2 which gives us zero in our answer.And then , our last column just has 1 minus nothing ( or 1 minus zero ) so that¡¯s still just 1.There , we¡¯ve calculated that the difference between 135 and 27 is 108.Alright , let¡¯s try another example with borrowing ( or re-grouping as some teachers call it ) . Let¡¯s subtract 58 from 426.Again we start by subtracting the digits in the ones place column.Here we have 6 - 8 , and since 6 it too small to subtract 8 from , we¡¯ll need to borrow.We always borrow from the number place on the left.We¡¯ll borrow a ¡®1¡¯ ( which is really a ¡¯10¡¯ ) and we¡¯ll write it in front of our borrowing digit ( in this case 6 ) which gives us 16.And don¡¯t forget to make the digit we borrowed from smaller by 1.You can just cross it out and write the new smaller number above it , like this.Okay , now we can subtract the first column : 16 - 8 = 8Now for the tens place . Since we borrowed from this column , it¡¯s become 1 - 5 , but again , the top number is too small , so we¡¯ll have to borrow again.We borrow a ¡®1¡¯ from the next number place over which mean that digit will change from a ¡®4¡¯ to a ¡®3¡¯.Then we put the ¡®1¡¯ in front of the borrowing digit which will make it 11.Now we can do the subtraction for that column : 11 - 5 = 6.And the last column is easy , we bring that leftover ¡®3¡¯ down to the answer line because there¡¯s nothing there to subtract from it , and that means 368 is our answer.So now you know the basics of multi-digit subtraction.But before you move on to practicing with exercises , I want to show you one more important trick.Once in a while , you¡¯ll come across a situation where you need to borrow from the next number place over , but that digit happens to be a zero ! How can you borrow from a zero ? Well , you can¡¯t . So you¡¯ll have have to borrow from the next TWO digits instead of just one.In this case , instead of borrowing from 0 , borrow from 40.You¡¯ll get the ¡®1¡¯ you need to borrow , and the 40 will become a 39.Or in this case¡­ If the ¡®3¡¯ needs to borrow , don¡¯t borrow from the ¡®0¡¯ , borrow from the ¡¯20¡¯ and there will be 19 left over.Or , what if there¡¯s two zeros in a row like this problem ? Well , if the ¡®2¡¯ needs to borrow , then borrow from the whole 500 next door . The 2 will become 12 , and the 500 will drop by one to become 499.Get the idea ? You can do that no matter how many zeros are in a row.Just keep including the next digit to the left until you get a number you can really borrow from.Okay - that wraps up this lesson . Hopefully you have a better idea of how multi-digit subtraction works , but to really get it down , you¡¯ve got to practice.So be sure to do those exercises.Thanks for watching and I¡¯ll see you next time.Learn more at www.mathantics.com test
