so now we 're going to begin our unit onvolume well and to talk about volume weneed to start with some new words andsome shapes which move fromtwo-dimensional to three-dimensional andthe first word is a polyhedron and apolyhedron is a solid form by a polygonthat that enclosed a single region ofspace and right now I have drawn apyramid here and this pyramid is itlooks like a square pyramid and it ismade up of polygons and those polygonsare squares and triangles each polygonthis would be considered a face of thepolyhedron and where to Paul where toexcuse me faces meet would be an edgeand where three or more edges meet wouldbe a vertex just like before when we didtwo dimensionals so now we have edgesfaces and vertices and the other thingwe need to talk about is how we classifypolyhedron and we classify polyhedronthe same way as we 've classifiedpolygons polygons we classify them bythe number of sides with polyhedra weclassify it by the number of faces andso some of the classifications are someof the words excuse me our tetrahedronor Penta Hedra in hexahedron heptahedron 's set two he drew an octahedronand of course a tetrahedron has fourfaces Penta five faces hexa six seveneight you can case yes now I 'm justtelling you how many faces that 's allthose words do they do n't exactly tellyou what the shape is a Penta Hedra hasfive faces well that could be let 's sayyou have a Pentagon they could knowit has a base of 4 and then true.thisbut that pyramid is a Penta he drewright 1 2 3 4 5 phases right 4 phases isa trike is a triangular pyramid on topof a triangle let 's give it a triangularpyramid all together this is so I drawthat 1 2 3I do n't do these very well can you seethat so it 's a triangular triangularpyramid with this hexahedron could be acube it could also be a pentagonalpyramid yes because it could be apentagon the base with six triangularfaces right so the these names are notas descriptive as the polygons okay soif so let 's get a little bit morespecific if indeed each face of apolyhedron is enclosed by a regularpolygon and each face is congruent tothe other faces and meet at each vertexin exactly the same way then thepolyhedron is called a regularpolyhedron okay and just like a regularpolygon where every angle is the sameand every side the same a regularpolyhedron every face - the same andthey meet the same way that 's kind of animportant mark and I have some examplesI 'm gon na try to draw these 600 cup ofcourse thank you like a curator diedhere that 's a regular polyhedron andthen then that has six faces this is aoctahedron it has eight faces and everyface is a equilateral triangleexcuse me a regular it 's a equilateraltriangle there 's a force and then I havealso let 's say this red one here istwelve faces you can see there goes thetwelve these are nice because all thesides are the same and all the same sizeso that 's why they make that donethat 's twelve faces that 's adodecahedron and then I have another onethat has 20 faces and if you can seelet 's see if you can if i zoom in alittle bit here this one every face isagain in equilateral triangle and theymeet in the same way now you may thinkabout what how does it not meet in thesame way around the room if when you goback to my room I have some shapeshanging from the ceiling where they'reactually pyramids that come out andthose are kind of those would not meetin the same way some of me convexcountry in concave you know they meetand those are called stellatedpolyhedrons now let 's talk about aspecial polyhedra as a prism is apolyhedron with two congruent polygonspolygonal faces and with all remainingfaces parallelograms this one is apentagonal prism we classify it by thetwo faces which match and of coursethese two faces are pentagons the onethat 's here and the one is hiding downthere and you 're likely to flavor likethis mist it still can be done and thefate the other remaining face work we'reall parallelograms now I do n't have itmarked but you can give me a littlecredit there and that 's okay I could bemore good now I have also drawn one thatlooks similar but a little bit differentand the parallelogram looks more likewhat you consider a parallelogram GIMPcan may be a little slanted not arectangle this one would be more looklike a rectangle this one looks likemore parallelogram kind of it acuteangle this one is also a prism these twoare congruent to Pentagon 's and thefaces are still parallel games well soyou 're saying well huhthe difference well this one if theparallelograms that are connecting areconnecting in right angles then it'scalled a right prison and I will markand a right angle here okay if they'reparallelograms are an acute angle wellthat means that there is a right angleout there but it 's out side of the prismthis is called an oblique prism and theBlake prisms are made up such that theseedges these lateral edges are notperpendicular to the base so the basesare the two polygons that are congruentand in a right prism the lateral edgesedges are indeed perpendicular to thebase so when I draw these out for you Iwill mark the right angle whether it'sgoing to be at the polygon or outsidethe pocket ok the polyhedra excuse meall right now there are also we saidthat a prism is made up of polygons butwe can also make shapes that are nonpolygons that have volume also andyou 're very familiar with something likea cylinder and the best definition Ifound was it 's a surface generated byrotating a parallel line segment arounda fixed line and so the rotation we'vekind of done that before when we rotateda two-dimensional object two dimensionalpolygons around an axis so now if youhave this axis and if I rotate a linesegment or it 's kind of you can think ofit as atango rotating around there then theywould make a cylinder once again I canmake a cylinder at a right angle or Ican take that axis and put it on adiagonal through this way and this onewould be an oblique cylinder and againto mark the right angle so you wouldknow the right angle here the height orthe altitude of this cylinder runs rightthrough the axis the altitude of thisone is actually going to be outside thecylinder so here 's the altitude from avertex from from a from one base to theother base running straight there 's thealtitude so on this one it would runthat 's the same as the axis on this oneit 's going to be on the outside now sowe defined polyhedra regular polyhedraand cylinders and you know this issupposed to be talking about volume wellI 'm sure that most of you have heard himyou know what a volume is if we take thevolume that it 's like stacking penniesright if you know how with the what thearea of a penny is or if it'stwo-dimensional and then how manypennies you have that 's your volume soor in other words the volume of anyprisonor cylinderis the area of the basemultipliedbut behindand oftentimes it 's V equals capital Ptimes H and capital B excuse me thecapital P refers to the area of the basethis works for any of these poly not notall any of the polyhedra excuse me itworks for the cylinders and the prismsso anything that has two congruent basesyou can use this and this is where we'rejust going to start okaythe volume of any prism or cylinder isthe area of the base so I have a coupleexamples this is the one I try to drawthis is a square pyramid these would beyour edges edges vertex vertex and theseare the faces the triangle for thetriangular faces and the base at thesquare base at the bottomthis would be a hexagonal yes hexagonalprism two hexagons that are parallelmeet with parallelograms and it let'ssee how many how many faces does n't haveit has one two and then six rectanglesdoes n't make eight that would make it anoctahedron yeshere is the triangular pyramid thetetrahedron that I did n't draw so wellyescourse cube and another right triangularprism yes this even though it has aregular equilateral it 's still not aregular polyhedron okay so here are yourproblems for the day we need to find thevolume and exact answers for a righttriangular prism with those edge lengthsa right cylinder with a race of sixinches and a height of 15 I know zoomout a second here there we go a regularhexagonal prism with every edge of eightand a ten an edge of ten inches that ispart of the rectangle and notice thatI 've marked that as right also and thennumber four is an oblique cylinder withthe radius of four inches and 15 inchesis a lateral inch and 12 inches is yourbounce dude okay all right good luck andI will see you tomorrow test
