video going work simplify ing simplify ing radical assuming youve background youve problem need see example direction sare going say simplify expression going assume value variable positive way use absolute value bar right first example got b third raised power times cube root fourth b since cube root raised power think going choose rewrite radical form cube root would cube root b third anything second term gon na leave would probably multiply everything great big cube root would simplify however taking look two cube root perfect cube dont want multiply together would turn around undo perfect cube root ace multiplying like bases add exponent neither one themis perfect cube bees b third alright perfect cube root want choose multiply together separate going rear ranging term cube root right gon na gon na totally rearrange times cube root got together variable matching alright ace since neither one cube root gon na go ahead multiplying like bases add exponent keep mind whole imaginary one right would give cube root fifth b third perfect cube going leave two separate cube root b third cube root b right go next line know perfect cube right perfect cube three right perfect cube leave alone gon na remain radical right five eight fifth power see come perfect cube right five know least three like one third would perfect cube would two left break one cube root eight third times cube root squared right two come fifth right um term right perfect cube go ahead take cube root give b simplify gon na stay cube simplify ing one time perfect cube know goes right everything else already simplified best done put together everything taken cube root pul led everything thats underneath q got stay underneath cube root gon na three b outside underneath cube root five also ana squared b right keep mind know positive value right example quotient square root bottom something raised one half power top like one think take turn radical form ill keep top make square root x square root x looking neither one perfect square root think going advantage write one great big radical front since theyre kind radical simplify front would writing big radical would x fifth third alright simplify underneath radical divided going give dividing like bases subtract exponent would square root squared back plain radical reim going try break perfect square root x squared perfect square root dont worry anything need pick biggest perfect square root goes gon na going stay reim gon na break square root times square root right gon na go ahead write way see square root x squared separate alright square root take square root x squared x right square root already outside done right times times x outside gon na give thing left radical would square root leaving assuming variable positive mess absolute right couple simplify ing radical assume background already done thanks watching give thumb subscribe channel share thanks example simplify ing radical college algebra algebra example simplify ing radical college algebra algebra example simplify ing radical college algebra algebra example simplify ing radical college algebra algebra example simplify ing radical college algebra algebra example simplify ing radical college algebra algebra example simplify ing radical college algebra algebra example simplify ing radical college algebra algebra example simplify ing radical college algebra algebra example simplify ing radical college algebra algebra example simplify ing radical college algebra algebra example simplify ing radical college algebra algebra example simplify ing radical college algebra algebra example simplify ing radical college algebra algebra example simplify ing radical college algebra algebra example simplify ing radical college algebra algebra
