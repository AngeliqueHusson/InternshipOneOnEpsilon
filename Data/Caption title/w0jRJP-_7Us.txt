g day welcome tech math channel looking video solve basically go whole bunch example different video also going put end video link eventually way get used little bit differently might find little bit easier think really worth getting method worked first way solve first hold break equation x use solve way get least one set coefficient front variable moment one three none match kind different x sare different make one set easiest way get equation times result going put equation equation multiply equation get equal equation stays plus equal take equation one equation see go take away give us take away cancel take away give us equal x equal work substitute x ill times equal equal seven four plus seven mean equal three thats equation one ill tell ill also substitute equation sort thing three times x three x three times three plus two calling times equal indeed correct mean answer correct put link next video also way might find different way k think really worth getting work properly anyway hope see next video bye simultaneous equation example solve simultaneous equation example solve simultaneous equation example solve simultaneous equation example solve simultaneous equation example solve simultaneous equation example solve simultaneous equation example solve simultaneous equation example solve simultaneous equation example solve simultaneous equation example solve
