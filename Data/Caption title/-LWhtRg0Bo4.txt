right let go make complicated right vertex angle going end point kind two ray going come together form let look angle thats kind one standard form thats look like one like right little bit dark er remember angle angle two ray right array member excuse end point going go infinity infinity point remember talking angle measurement two ray two sides lot times call initial terminal side rotating point rotate call vertex thats vertex angle two ray go thats quick little description vertex angle thanks vertex angle vertex angle vertex angle vertex angle
