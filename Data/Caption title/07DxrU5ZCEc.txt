in this video I want to show you how toidentify the local maximum and minimumsof a function by using its graph so youmay have heard those terms beforemaximum and minimum and maybe even havea really good idea as to what they meanmost people say well the maximum is theabsolute highest place on the entiregraph and the minimum is the absolutelowest place on the graph and if I justsaid maximun you would be correctsometimes however we want something alittle bit weaker known as the local Maxand mins now you might be saying waitlocal what what 's the difference betweenthe two well in a local Max or a localmin it does n't necessarily have to bethe absolute highest or the absolutelowest just as long as it 's the highestpoint on a small interval it 's goodenough to be called a local Max and aslong as it 's the lowest point on a smallinterval you can call it a local minimumlet 's get a graphing and let me show youwhat I 'm talking about so if I wanted tomark out the absolute highest point onthis graph it 's really hard to dobecause this arrow indicates that thisthing actually keeps going on and onforever in fact it does n't have anabsolute highest point it just keepsgetting bigger however what if I justwanted to look at this section of thegraph if I only looked at thatparticular section then this point righthere would be the highest of thatsection so I can call that a localmaximum now you can see with with thistype of definition that I might actuallyhave more than one local Max it alldepends on what interval I 'm looking atso if I look at this small interval overhere then I have another local Maxnow with that ID in mind you can alsolook at low points in the graph andagain think about some small intervaland if you have some point that is thesmallest of that interval well then youhave your local minimum and depending onthe graph or function you may have a fewof these so here 's an example of a graphthat has two local max two local mineven though it really does increaseforever and ever and it keeps decreasingforever now to describe where theseplaces happen you basically describe thepoint at where it occurs let 's do thiswith the following example so I want tofind all the local maximums and all thelocal minimums let 's start with ourlocal next so here I can see I have ahigh point maybe on this small intervalbetween say four and seven so local maxlooks like I have one at 5/7 and that ismy only local maximum now you may bewondering well what about this cornerhere is it a local Max and the answer isactually no if I try and look at aninterval say between negative 6 andnegative 4 this point is not the thehighest point in there there 's lots ofother points that are equally as high soit must be the app you know the highestof that interval let 's go ahead and grabour local minimums so it looks like Ihave a nice interval down here at alocal minimum at negative 6 negative 7again do n't worry about spots like thisbecause when you try and cut down yourinterval there 's lots of other pointsthat are exactly the same height so ithas to be the lowest of that intervalall right looks like that 's all of ourMax and min for this graph let 's look atone more this one 's a bit more curvylet 's see if we can find our high andlow points so I have one here anotherhigh point here so local maximums lookslike we have one at negative 5/3 andanother one at 4 negative 2okay local minimums looks like here'soneone negative six like the other one ishere at five negative three and justlike that you have all of your localmaximums and minimums Pre-Calculus - Identify the local maximum and minimum of a function Pre-Calculus - Identify the local maximum and minimum of a function Pre-Calculus - Identify the local maximum and minimum of a function
