Determine the domain and range for the relation describedby the table.And so what they want us to say , whatthey want us to figure out , when they say the domain , they 're saying , what are all of the possible inputs that wecould put into -- in this case , a relation , and later we 'll see into functions -- and so over here -- or I guess one way to think about it -- what are all of the inputs that this relationship isdefined for ? And so you can view the x as the input.So when x is negative 1 , y is 3.When x is 3 , y is negative 2.When x is 3 again , now y is 2.And that 's why we can't describe this as a functionhere , because we have two different y values for a givenx value , but it can be a relation.When x is 4 , y is 8.When x is 6 , y is negative 1.So to answer the first part , whenthey ask us what is the domain of this relation , they'rereally just saying , what are all the inputs ? What are all the x values for which this relation is defined ? And they list the x values right over here.So it is the set -- and that's what these curly brackets meanthat I 'm about to describe a set -- itis a set of the numbers , negative 1 , 3 , 4 , and 6.So all we 're saying here is if wesay the domain of this relation is these four numbers , it says that this relation is definedfor any of these four numbers.If you give any of these four numbers as an x value , there is a y , at least one y value , associated with it.Now , when they talk about the range of this relation -- and the idea also applies to functions , which are a more specific class of relations.You can view them as a well-behaved relation.The range is , what are all the possible outputsthat this relation can give you ? Or given the inputs , what are all of the possible valuesthat this relation can take on ? So here you 'll take a look at all of the possible y valuesthat it can take on.So we can get -- and I 'll write -- we could write them in orderor we do n't have to write them in order , but I 'll write them in order just for the sake of it.Actually , let 's just go straight this way.It does n't have to be in order.A set does not imply some type of order.It just means a collection of things.So the range here , well , our y value can take on the value 3.It can take on the value negative 2.It can take on the value 2.It can take on the value 8.And it can take on the value negative 1.And we 're done.These are the x values for which this relation is definedthat you can actually find an association or relationship.And these are all the y values.These are all of the outputs of the relation that it can takeon , and we just looked right over here to find them . test
