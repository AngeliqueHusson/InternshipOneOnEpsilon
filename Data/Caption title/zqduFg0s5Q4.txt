- So let 's talk about the unitof measurement called the `` gram . `` And the gram is a unit of measurement for measuring mass.Now , what is mass ? Well , you might have seen in everyday language , someone might look at a feather , let me see if I can draw a good feather.So a feather like this.And say , `` Hey , this is not very massive . `` This is not massive.And notice , you have that word `` mass '' in there.And then they might point to some big boulder , some big heavy boulder , let me draw a big heavy boulder.And say , `` This is massive . `` This is massive.And so , just with those examples , you might get an intuition for what mass is.It 's how much stuff there is , and it 's related to weight.And I said `` related to weight , '' not the same thing as weight , because later on when you take Physics , you will learn that mass and weight are related , but that they 're not exactly the same thing.Now , if you 're on a given planet , and the same distance from the center of that planet , roughly speaking , mass and weightwill be strongly related to each other.Something with more mass is going to have more weight.Two things with the same mass , once again if I 'm on the same planet , at the same distance from the center of the planet , they 're going to have the same weight.So you 'll often hear people say , '' How many grams does that thing weigh ? `` They really should be saying , '' How many grams does that thing mass , '' but it 's okay , because as long as we 're staying on earth , roughly you know , at sea level , plus or minus a little bit , or even if we 're a little bit further away from sea level , mass and weight , it 's not crazyto hold them a little bit interchangeable.And one way to gauge something 's massis to hold it if you can , and say , '' Okay , how much does this weigh , '' because the more something weighs , the more its mass is going to be.The more something 's mass is going to be , the more it 's going to weigh , once again , assuming we 're on the planet , etc. , etc.When you take Physics class , you 'll learn thatthey are different concepts thatare closely related to each other.So , that 's what a gram is.Now , another thing that you will seein the context of mass and measuring mass , is the kilogram.And all the kilogram is , and you 're going to seethe prefix `` kilo- '' over and over again , in your , I guess your education careers , especially when you're thinking about units.But `` kilo- '' is just a prefix for 1000.So that literally means 1000 grams.So instead of saying `` 2000 grams , '' I could say `` 2 kilograms . `` So with that out of the way , let 's seeif we can get a sense for what one gramor different numbers of grams of masses areand what might have a mass of one kilogramor 10 kilograms or 100 kilograms.And that 's exactly why I got all of these pictures prepared.So if , if you want to get a sense of somethingthat has a mass of one gram , think of a paper clip.And I have this little squiggly thing here , because that right there , that means `` roughly . `` Every paper clip isn't going to be exactly 1 gram ; it might be 1 1/2 grams , it might besmall paper clips that are 1/2 gram.But it gives you the sense ofwhat would have a mass of 1 gram.And if you want to know how much something with a massof 1 gram weighs on the surface of the earth , well , you could just hold that paper clip and kind of judge , feel how much it's pulling down on your hand.Now , or how much the weight of itis pushing down on your hand , I guess I could say.Now , if you want to get a sense of thingsthat are little bit more massive , a pencil is five times as massive as a paper clip.And hopefully you 'll see that , if you hold five paper clipson one side and a pencil on the other side , you 'll see that they roughly have the same mass , and their weight will be roughly the same.Now , a little bit more massive , you could think of a field mouse.A field mouse is equivalent to the massof roughly 4 pencils , or 20 paperclips.You want to get even more massive , you can think of a kitten.So , a kitten after a couple of weeks , it 's still a kitten now , it's still not a fully grown cat , it 'll have a mass of about 200 to 300 grams.And this makes a rough amount of sense , you can imagine this thing having the same massas maybe 10 or 15 of these little field mice.You can imagine the mouse is about that size , right over there.I could do a better job drawing a mouse.But that makes some sense.So what if we get even larger ? What if we get into the ranges of , say , 1000 grams ? Well , now we can start talking about kilograms.And just to be clear , when I put a `` g '' here , that 's just an abbreviation for `` gram . `` So this is 1 gram , 5 grams , 20 grams.And now , if you want to go to 1000 grams , you could think of something likea hard-cover textbook like this one.And they 're obviously , some textbooks are huge , but the one that I 'm showing hereI did n't weigh or figure out the mass of this exact one.But it would have a mass of roughly1 kilogram , or 1000 grams.So that 's a kilogram right over there , 1000 grams.A fully grown cat , that's about 3 to 5 kilograms , depending on how fully grown it isor I guess how big of a cat it is.So , that 's pretty interesting , a fully grown catis more than 10 times the mass of a kitten.Actually that makes sense , most fully grown humansare more than 10 times their masswhen they were very , very young , or actually roughly 10 times the mass of whenthey were very young , so it actually makes sense.Now , if you want to get even larger , you can go to a large ape , like a human being , in particular , this one right over here.70 kilograms , and this is actuallypretty close to my actual mass , 70 kilograms.And you get a sense of what that would meanif you 're used to dealing with pounds.I weigh a little over 160 pounds , so that 's about 70 kilograms.Or 1 kilogram is roughly 2.2 poundsif you are used to thinking in terms of pounds.But , once again , pounds are a unit of weight , while kilograms are a unit of mass.And then , if you want to get even heavier , you would get 10 times more massivethan a human being , than a normal-sized human being , you might get to something like this cow , and this cow would have a mass of 750 kilograms.So , how many paper clips would you needto have the same mass as this cow ? Well , you might be tempted to say 750 , but remember this is 1 gram , this is 750 kilograms.So the mass of this cow is actually 750,000 grams.So you would need about 750,000 of thesepaper clips to have the same mass as this cow . test
