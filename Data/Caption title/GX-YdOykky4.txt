all right in this example we 're gonnagraph the rational function X cubed plusx squared minus 4x minus 4 over xsquared plus X minus 6 so a couple ofthings I 'm going to do first off I'mgoing to think about really what 's thedomain of this function but any sort ofvertical asymptotes I think that 's thefirst thing that might be useful here soto figure out any vertical asymptotesthe first thing I 'm going to do is setthe denominator equal to zero and thisis going to factor as X plus 3x minus 2equals 0 so at x equals negative 3 youwill get 0 and at x equals positive 2we 'll get 0 again this doesn'tnecessarily mean that we have verticalasymptotes at negative 3 & 2 it justdepends on if we get zero out of thenumerator as well or not so I 'm going toplug negative 3 into the numerator andI 'm gon na plug positive 2 also well I'mgonna plug it in everywhere but I'minterested in what happens in thenumerator as we know already that youget 0 in the bottom in both cases if youplug negative 3 and negative 3 cubed isnegative 27 negative 3 squared would bepositive 9 negative 3 times negative 4would be positive 12 and then minus 4well that 's negative 27 9 and 12 istwenty one so negative 27 plus 21 wouldbe negative 6 minus 4 would give usnegative 10 over 0so since we 're getting something nonzero over zero that tells me that xequals negative three is a verticalasymptote notice if we plug in twothough if we plug 2 into the numeratorwe get two cubed which is 8 plus 2squared which is 4 minus 4 times 2 whichwill be 8 minus 4 8 minus 8 is 0 4 minus4 is 0 so we 're getting 0 over 0 so thattells me at x equals 2 there 's gon na bea hole in the graph okay fair enough soI 'm gon na go ahead and start puttingthese things on my on my graph here andjust kind of you know fill it in as wego ok so let 's see we said at negative 3we 've got a vertical asymptote sonegative 1 negative 2 negative 3okay.we I 'm gon na keep in mind that attwo there 's gon na be a hole in the graphso we 'll come back to thatokay let 's also keep thinking aboutasymptotes here because I like to doasymptotes because it kind of gives mesort of some you know sort of I almostthink about them as little fences itkeeps usually everything trapped inthereso for horizontal asymptotes notice inthis case the degree of the numerator isbigger than the degree of thedenominator so that means that there areno horizontal asymptotesbut again there will be an obliqueasymptote since the degree of thenumerator is one larger than the degreeof the denominator so to figure that outto figure out what the what the obliqueasymptote is we could even go ahead andsimply just do our long divisionI think I 'm gon na try to reduce thispolynomial a little bit first okay wesaid the denominator factors as X plus 3times X minus 2we made the observation that if you plug2 into the numerator we get zero outthat means that the numerator factors asX minus 2 times something well the waythat we can figure out what we need tomultiply by is we can do long divisionwe can take X cubed plus x squared minus4x minus 4 if I divide that by X minus 2I 'm gon na get the the missing factor andto do this long division or excuse me todo this division we could do longdivision or I 'm gon na use syntheticdivisionso we 'll put a positive two outside andthen one one negative four negative fourunderneath okay so if we drop the onedown then we multiply so two times oneis two then we add so one plus two isthree two times three is six negativefour plus six is two two times two isfourthat gives us our remainder of zerosince we started with something cubed ifthis will be our x squared this will beour X this will be our constant so itsays the numerator actually factors as Xminus 2 times x squared plus three Xplus two and I think what I 'm gon na donow is I 'm going to factor this just alittle bit further if possible so we'vegot our X minus two I 'm not cancellinganything out yetx squared plus three X plus two actuallyfactors as X plus 1 and X plus 2 we'vegot X plus 3 in the denominator and Xminus 2 in the denominator I 'm gon na goahead and cancel those out so we 're leftwith X plus 1 over X plus 2 over X plus3 and I do n't think we can really reducethis much any any further the next thingI 'm going to do is think aboutx-intercepts so to figure outx-intercepts we let y equal 0 or theleft side be 0 so we would have 0 equalsX plus 1 times X plus 2 over X plus 3well if you multiply both sides of ourfraction by excuse me of our equation byX plus 3 we 'll just be left with 0equals X plus 1 times X plus 2 or againequivalently you know to me I think of afraction is going to equal 0 it 's thetop part that has to be 0 if we set thefirst factor equal to 0 we 'll get xequals negative 1 if we set the secondfactor equal to 0 we 'll get x equalsnegative 2 so those are going to be myx-intercepts so you might as well goahead and put those on our graph we saidx equals negative 3 was our verticalasymptote so at negative 1 and negative2 it looks like we 're also givingx-intercepts so there 's negative 2 andnegative 1 again notice both of each ofthese have multiplicity of 1 and againsince they have a multiplicity of 1 thatmeans that our function simply has topass through the graph it can come backup but it wo n't simply just bounce offthe x-axis ok so let 's seefrom this formula from this simplifiedversion I 'm also going to find they-intercept so to figure out they-intercept we simply plug in x equalszero so if we plug in zero well we'llhave 1 times 2 which is 2 on the bottomwe 'll have 3 so it looks like we'regetting 2/3 is our y-intercept so we'llstick positive 1 up there we 'll saypositive 2/3 it 's you know somewhereinside of there ok let 's see a few otherthings here notice we have X plus 1times X plus 2 over X plus 3 again if wemultiply that out we 've got X plus 3 inthe denominator we would have x squaredplus 2x plus 1 X which we give us 3 Xplus 2 again there 's no horizontalasymptotes because the degree of thenumerator is larger than the degree ofthe denominator but this function willhave oblique asymptotes ok it does havean oblique asymptote because thenumerator is one degree larger so tofind that oblique asymptote I 'm going todivide the numerator by the denominatorbut I 'm going to use synthetic divisionso we have positive 1 x squared positive3x and positive 2 on the outside I'mgoing to use the opposite sign ornegative 3I dropped my 1 down negative 3 times 1would be negative 3 we add thosetogether we 'll get 0 negative 3 times 0is 0 we add those we get 2 this is gonnabe our remainder since we started withsomething squared this is our X and thisis our constant so really it says whatwe can do is we can write our originalfunctionour simplified function x squared plus3x plus 2 over X plus 3 it says we canreally write that as 1 X plus ourremainder of 2 over X plus 3 but againif you kind of forget about everythingif you forget about the remainderwhatever 's out front that 's gon na beyour oblique asymptote so in this caseour oblique asymptote is going to be theline y equals x so I 'm gon na go back andstick that on the graph so let 's see yequals x remember that 's just kind of ay-intercept of 0 that goes through theorigin okay so now we 've got we 've gotour asymptotes we 've got a few pointshere I think the last thing I would doyou could always start plotting a fewpoints one thing you know I think tohelp me figure out sort of what 's goingon it clearly looks like the graph is inthe top the top you know sort of inbetween my asymptotes up here and Ithink that 's what has to happennotice it could n't come from the bottombecause if it came from the bottom againit would have to go through ourx-intercept of negative 1 and then itwould have to cross the x-axis again toget to our y-intercept and then we wouldhave another x-intercept which which isnot allowed so you could plot a fewpoints just to figure out a little bitbetter what 's going on but I 'm gonnamake the conclusion that our graph isdoing something like that it 's basicallystaying above our to the right of ourhorizontal the right of our vertical andabove our oblique again always plot afew more points just to make sure theother thing I 'm going to figure out isyou know sort of to the left of ourvertical asymptote because the graph uphere is it down herewell let 's plug in maybe negative 4 andsee what value we get out notice thatthis is the lawline y equals x this was x equalsnegative three so this point on theintersection that would be the pointnegative 3 comma negative 3 so I 'm gonnause that as a reference here okay solet 's see where in our formula go okayso we had f of X equals x squared plus3x plus 2 over X plus 3 so I 'm justusing this one again I think we saidwe 're gon na plug in the value negative 4just to see where we 're atso f of negative 4 negative 4 squaredwould be positive 16 positive 3 timesnegative 4 would be negative 12 plus 2negative 4 plus 3 would be negative 1 soit looks like we have 4 plus 2 which is6 over negative 1 it looks like we'regetting negative 6 out so okay so sincethis is the line y equals x this wouldbe the point negative 4 comma negative 4well negative 6 is certainly a littlefurther down than that so there 's gonnabe another point on our graph negative 4comma 6 and again to approach thisvertical asymptote I know it ca n't go upbecause then you would have another xintercept so I know it 's kind of goingdown there and to get close to thathorizontal asymptote it 'll just have tomove it 'll get closer to that excuse methat oblique asymptote it 'll get closerto that oblique asymptote as you move tothe left Graphing a Rational
