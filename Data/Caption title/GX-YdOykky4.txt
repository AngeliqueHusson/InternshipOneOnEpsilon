right example rational function x cube plus x squared minus minus x squared plus x minus couple going first think really domain function sort vertical asymptote think first thing might useful figure vertical first thing going denominator equal zero going factor x plus minus x equal negative get x equal positive get doesnt necessarily mean negative get zero well going negative numerator gon na plug positive also well plug everywhere happen know already get bottom case negative negative cube negative negative squared would positive negative times negative positive minus negative twenty one negative plus would negative minus would give us negative since getting something nonzero zero tell negative three vertical asymptote notice plug two though plug numerator get two cube plus minus times minus minus getting x equal gon na hole graph fair enough gon na go ahead start thing graph kind know fill k let see said negative got vertical asymptote negative negative negative gon na keep mind two gon na hole graph come back tha tokay let also keep thinking like kind give sort know sort almost think little fence usually everything trapped horizontal asymptote notice case degree numerator bigger degree denominator mean horizontal oblique asymptote since degree one degree denominator figure figure oblique asymptote could even go ahead simply long division think gon na try reduce polynomial little bit first said denominator factor x plus x minus made observation numerator get zero mean numerator factor x minus times something well way figure need multiply long division take x cube plus x squared minus divide x minus gon na get missing factor long division excuse division could long division gon na use put positive two outside one one negative four negative four underneath drop one multiply two times one two add one plus two three two times three six negative four plus six two two times two give us remainder zero since star ted something cube x squared x constant numerator actually factor x minus times x squared plus three x plus two think gon na going factor little bit possible weve got x minus two yet x squared plus three x plus two x plus x plus weve got x plus denominator x minus denominator gon na cancel left x plus x plus x n think really reduce much next thing going think figure let equal left side would plus times x plus x plus multiply sides fraction excuse equation x plus left x plus times x plus equivalently know think fraction going equal top part set first factor equal get negative set second factor equal get x going might well put graph said x equal negative vertical asymptote negative look like also negative negative notice multiplicity since multiplicity function simply topass graph come backup wo n simply bounce x axis k let see formula simplified version also going find intercept figure intercept simply plug x plug zero well well times bottom look like getting intercept well stick positive say positive know somewhere inside k let see notice x plus x plus x plus multiply got x plus denominator would x squared plus plus x give us x plus degree degree denominator function oblique asymptote k oblique asymptote one degree find oblique asymptote going divide numerator denominator going use synthetic division positive x squared positive outside use opposite sign negative drop ped negative times negative add together get negative times add get remainder since star ted something squared x constant really say write simplified function x squared plus x plus say really write x plus remainder x plus kind forget everything forget remainder whatever front gon na oblique asymptote case oblique asymptote going line equal x gon na go back stick graph let see x remember kind ay intercept goes origin got asymptote got think last thing would could always start plotting one thing know think help figure sort going clearly look like graph top top know sort asymptote think happen notice could n come bottom came bottom would go negative would cross x axis get intercept would another x intercept could plot figure little bit better going conclusion graph something like right horizontal right vertical oblique always plot point make sure thing going figure know sort left vertical asymptote graph well let plug maybe negative see value get notice law line equal x x three point intersection would point negative comma negative reference see formula go f x equal x squared plus x plus one think said gon na plug value negative see f negative negative squared would positive positive times negative would negative plus plus would negative look like plus negative look like getting negative since line equal x would point negative comma negative negative certainly little another point graph negative approach vertical asymptote know ca n go would another x intercept know kind going get close horizontal asymptote move get closer excuse oblique asymptote get closer oblique asymptote move left graph
