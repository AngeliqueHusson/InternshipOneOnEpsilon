so welcome to my video on matrixmultiplication and before I get startedwith this example I want to talk aboutthe sizes of each matrix because notevery matrix can be multiplied byanother matrix so let 's take a look atthe size of this first matrix and thisfirst matrix we have one two rows and wehave one two three columns so this firstmatrix is a two by three matrix two rowsby three columns and if we take a lookat the second matrix for multiplying wehave one two three rows and we have onetwo three columns so the second Matrixis a three by three matrix so in orderto multiply two matrices together thecolumns in the first matrix must equalthe rows in the second Matrix so inother words these two inside numbersmust be the same so it 's reallyimportant to check this before youmultiply matrices if these two insidenumbers are not the same you cannotmultiply the two matrices so after youmake sure that you 're inside numbers arethe same then you can take a look atyour outside numbers and I 'll draw somearrows to point to the outside numbersand the outside numbers will always giveyou the size of the new matrix afteryou 're done multiplying so since theoutside numbers are a 2 and a 3 we knowthe size of the new matrix after we'redone multiplying is going to be a 2 by 3matrix so let 's just get started rightaway with this example so basically whatwe 're doing when we multiply twomatrices is we 're multiplying the rowsof the first matrix by the columns ofthe second Matrix so I 'm going to put abox around the first row of the firstmatrix and I 'm going to put another boxaround the first column of the secondMatrixand just to make things a little easierto see when we multiply I 'm going tocircle the first number and the row ingreen and I 'm going to circle the firstnumber in the column in green and I'mgoing to circle the second number in therow in black and I 'm going to circle thesecond number in the column in black andI 'm going to circle the third number inthe row in red and I 'm going to circlealso the third number in the column inred so now when we multiply the firstrow by the first column we can multiplythe green numbers together which is 2times 3 2 times 3 is 6 then we canmultiply the black numbers together 3times 1 which is just positive 3 and wecan multiply the red numbers together 1times 2 is just positive 2 so now wehave multiplied the first row by thefirst column and now I want to do theexact same thing with the first row andthe second column and the first row isstill boxed from earlier and I 'll putanother box around the second column andonce again I 'm going to circle the firstnumber in green the second number inblack and the third number in red and ifyou multiply the green numbers togetherwe get 2 times 4 which is 8 if wemultiply the black numbers together weget 3 times 1 which is just positive 3if we multiply the red numbers togetherwe get 1 times 1 which is just positive1 and now we have multiplied the firstrow by the second column and now I'mgoing to do the same thing all overagainnow I 'm going to do the first row by thethird column the first row is alreadyboxed from before and I 'll put a boxaround the 3rd column once again I'mgoing to circle the first numbers ingreen the second numbers in black andthe third numbers in red and if youmultiply the green numbers we get 2times 5 which is just 10and if we multiply the black numbers weget 3 times 4 which is just positive 12and if we multiply the red numbers weget 1 times 4 which is just positive 4so now we have multiplied one of thefirst matrix by every single column ofthe second Matrix so now we need to dothe exact same thing with the second rowof the first matrix so I 'll put a boxaround the second row and we need tomultiply that second row with everycolumn of the second Matrix so I 'm gonnastart with the first column and I 'll puta box around it and once again I 'm goingto circle the first numbers in green thesecond numbers in black and the thirdnumbers in red and if we multiply thegreen numbers together we have 2 times 3which gives us a positive 6 and if wemultiply the black numbers together wehave negative 7 times 1 which is justnegative 7 and if we multiply the rednumbers together we have 4 times 2 whichis positive 8 so now we multiply thesecond row by the first column and nowwe need to do the exact same thing withthe second column so I 'm going to put abox around the second column once againcircle the first number in green thesecond number in black and the thirdnumber in red if you multiply the greennumbers together we have 2 times 4 whichis positive 8 and if we multiply theblack numbers together we have negative7 times 1 which is just negative 7 andif you multiply the red numbers togetherwe have 4 times 1 which is just positive4 so now we have multiplied the secondrow by the second column and now we haveto do it one last time we need tomultiply the second row by the thirdcolumn so I 'll put a box around the 3rdcolumnonce again the first number in green thesecond number in black and the thirdnumber in red if we multiply the greennumbers together we have 2 times 5 whichis positive 10 if we multiply the blacknumbers together we have negative 7times positive 4 which is negative 28and if we multiply the red numberstogether we have 4 times 4 which ispositive 16 so as you can see theseproblems can get pretty long and tediousbut now we have multiplied every rowfrom the first matrix with every columnfrom the second Matrix so now the onlything you have left to do is justsimplify this matrix and add all thesenumbers together in the top left cornerwe have 6 plus 3 plus 2 which is 11 inthe bottom left corner we have 6 minus 7which is negative 1 negative 1 plus 8 ispositive 7 and in the second column wehave 8 plus 3 which is 11 11 plus 1 is12 and we also have 8 minus 7 which ispositive 1 1 plus 4 is equal to 5 and inthe top right we have 10 plus 12 whichis 22 22 plus 4 is equal to 26 and inthe bottom right we have 10 minus 28which is negative 18 negative 18 plus 16is equal to negative 2 and this is afinal answer we have completelymultiplied these two matrices together
