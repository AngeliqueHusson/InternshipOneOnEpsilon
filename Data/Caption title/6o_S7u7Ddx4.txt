right video going finding unit vector unit unit vector vector v take vector v divide magnitude length unit vector simply vector point direction original vector going kind alter magnitude length magnitude length one nothing terrible three example let find unit vector direction given get vector one well got vector three comma four component three comma four let find magnitude know maybe call vector v magnitude vector v take component square add together square root squared going give square root simply going give us take square root really say unit vector would vector dividing remember happen really think multiplying scalar multiplying vector comma recall real number front multiply get give us unit vector going pointing exact direction original simply going length finding unit vector ex finding unit vector ex finding unit vector ex finding unit vector ex finding unit vector ex finding unit vector ex
