If you have a picture of the graph of the function , you can find discontinuities justby looking for breaks in the graph.These could be point discontinuities like this , jump discontinuities like this , infinitediscontinuities like this , or endpoint discontinuities like this.When you 're tracing the graph from one side to the other , if you ever come to any pointwhere you have to pick up your pencil in order to keep drawing the next section , then there'sa discontinuity at that point.When you have an endpoint like this , it's discontinuous because the general limit doesn'texist.The right hand limit exists because as we trace the graph from the right side towardthe left , we approach a value of 2.But there 's no left hand limit because there's no graph to the left of this point.And since there 's only a right hand limit and no left hand limit , it means there 's nogeneral limit.And since there 's no general limit , the function is technically discontinuous at the endpoint.When you have an asymptote on the end like this , there 's no discontinuity at this point.The function is still continuous here.In order for there to be a discontinuity at an asymptote , the graph has to exist on bothsides of the asymptote , and since the graph does not exist to the right of this asymptote , there 's no discontinuity here.So what if you do n't have a picture of the graph , but you have the equation of the functionitself ? Then how do you know where the function has discontinuities ? Well rational functions , which are fractions with polynomials in the numerator and denominator , like all of these , are the most common types of functions to have discontinuities.Because fractions are undefined when the denominator is zero , any value that makes the denominatorzero is going to make a discontinuity in the function.If the zero value can be canceled out of the denominator , then it 's a point discontinuity.If it ca n't be canceled out , then it 's an infinite discontinuity.If we take this rational function as an example , we can see that it 'll have discontinuitiesat x=2 and at x=6 , because both of those values make the denominator zero.If we factor the numerator , we can cancel out the x-2 , but not the x-6.Because we were able to remove the x-2 , it means that x=2 is a point , or removable , discontinuity.Since we could n't factor out the x-6 , it means x=6 is an infinite , or nonremovable , discontinuity.If we sketch the curve , we can see the point discontinuity at x=2 , and the infinite discontinuity ( which is just a vertical asymptote , by the way ) , at x=6.You can also get discontinuities from piecewise defined functions.For this piecewise function , y=x defines the curve to the left of x=3 , and at x=3 itself.And y=4 defines the function to the right of x=3.If we sketch these curves , we can see that there 's a discontinuity at the break pointof x=3.So to summarize , if you 're looking for discontinuities in the function and you have a picture ofthe graph , just look for any point where you have to pick up your pencil , or look for endpoints , and all those points will be your discontinuities.If you do n't have the graph but your function is a rational function , look for values thatmake the denominator zero.These will be point discontinuities if you can factor them out , or infinite discontinuitiesif you can't.If your function is a piecewise function , then look at each piece separately for discontinuities , but make sure to look also at the break point between the conditions.If the functions do n't meet each other at the same value , then there 's a jump discontinuityat that point . test
