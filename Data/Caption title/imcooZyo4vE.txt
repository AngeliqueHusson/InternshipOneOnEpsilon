oh I can actually fix it I do n't knowwhy I 'm study picky today okay all rightokay so we all know this is the digitalPhoenicians of M factorialand that 's just n times n minus 1 timesn minus 2 times theta dot times 2 times1 right for example when we have 6factorial this means that we are goingto stop at 6 and each every time we godown by 1 so it 's just 6 times 5 times 4times 3 times 2 times 1right and you can work this outguesstimate when he and I quess 5factorial this and you can work that outyou get 120 and now I have a questionfor you have you guessed the typofactorial and let me write this down forexample what if we have 6 type offactorial what does this even mean firstof all the material gets that this righthere we are not trying to say 6factorial in your parentheses and thendo the factorial okay this right heremeans that ok let me just work thisinside out 6 fatty row inside thisparenthesis that 's 720 and then we aregoing to work out another factorial well720 factorial that 's such anastronomical number I will just dig thatyou guys maybe guess can try to do thisat Wolfram Alpha and I do n't needbecause they are going to crash whoafrom your phone now but you can leave acomment down below let me know if Ihave n't tried by the way this is not thesame notation stop let me explain to youguys who win by double factorial so whenwe have six type of factorial is rightherewe start off with six okay and eachevery time we go down by two so the nextnumber will be four and then we keepgoing down until two because that 's asmallest positive even integer and youstop right here and you multiply allthis six times four times two alltogether again48 okay if you have an odd number insideand you have five type of factorial likethis okaythis means you start off at five andthen the next number you multiply youstill go two by twoso you 're multiplied by three and thenyou multiply by one multiply that outyou get 15 okay so this is what I meanwhen you have type of factorial and ofcourse you can write a definition andtype of factorialsounds like that you can say n times nminus 2 times n minus 4 and so onand maybe you can break down to casesbut I 'm gon na do that to you guysbecause what I would like to do is Iwould like to write some formulas wasmaybe definitions when we have n type offactorial I want to use the originalfactorial definition to help us to dothat so that 's the question and that'swhat I would do for you guys in thisvideo and also this might be usefulwhenever what dealing with like powerseries institutions to a differentialequation because sometimes you may haveto multiply a bunch of even numbers or abunch of not our numbers and dependingif you want to use the type of factorialnotation or you can use the definitionthat I 'm about to show you it 's overfighting pattern and how to read formulaokay so now let 's get started we havetwo cases to consider because it mattersif it 's even or odd and let 's start withan even first okayso first case if yes even and to do thisI 'm just going to look at this as anexample and then I 'll try to come with aformula for that okay so now if you lookat this for example this is just anexample that we have which is the sixdouble factorial and as we all knowalready this is just six times fourtimes two and once again I want to buildup a connection between the type offactorial and the single factorial okaynow let 's look at this six four and twothey are all even numbers and if youwould like you can look at this as 3times 2 that 's 6 and for the for a yearyou can look at this as 2 times 2 rightthem for the two right here you can lookat this one times two how 's thatand when we do this you see we have twotimes two times two stroke them togethermultiplying it I can write this two tothe third power and then 3 times 2 times1and guess what that 's the KyotoPhoenicians of the single factorialright so I can write this down asmultiplying by 3 factorial just likethatthis is an example for that is n't it andnow I will just have to drive a formulafor this if n is even then I can tellyou guys that and double factorial it'sthe following check this out when n is 6okay you 're always going to have a lotof tools because everybody 's even youca n't factor things out right when n is6 we have few of the tools multiplyingwell how do we get from 6 to 3 justdivide it by 2 rightso on top of factorial we will alwayshave this 2 and then the power it 's justgoing to be this divided by 2 half of itright so I will just read it down andover to like that and now if you look atthis 3 because what this and that areactually to say you can try to do itwith 8 top of Vittorio you will see thatthis number and that number will be thesame so all I have to do is I will justdo this number which is and over 2 andthen I will do the regular factorial forthat ok so this is a pretty gooddefinition of an type of Vittorio pointand is eepa and some of you guys maythat may not like this because we seefraction and then pull you up fractioninstead of the factorial that lookspretty intimidating right so this is theway to go wrong with this one n is evenwe can write as 2 times some otherinteger I will just put this dance ok okso in another worldcan replace Odion with 2 K right 2 timesK 4 n so for example when we have 6 thisis the same si 2 times 3 when we havethat say 12I can just say 2 times 6 when we have100 we can just put a dance 2 times 50and you know the 50 you put me there Kis inside that anyway where you have adouble factorial I can write this downas 2 + + / - rightlet 's use 2 K into n - K over 2 is justK okay and then times let 's plug in 2 Kinto this n - K over 2 once again it'sjust K and then we have that factorialokay so depends on how you would like towrite your yeah gradual format I 'll sayso this is a double factorial under thecondition that you write 2 K 1 aha soit 's pretty yeah this is pretty prettyok take a textured spice okayno anyway ok now let 's look at thesecond situation if and yes ah ok thenI 'm going to come up with a definitionfor a double factorial but n is equal toheart and now we have to make someobservation yeahthis should n't be an example this shouldbe an observation okay so oh yes muchbetter anyway let 's make anotherobservation and take a guess which arenumber we are going to use of coursefive so let 's make an observation withfive double factorial as we all knowthis means okay five times three timesone okay sure five times three times onehmm in this case I can not really do whatwe did because I can factor all anythingright well first of all we notice thatwe have three factors right herehmm okay imagine if I have 5 times 4times 3 times 2 and n times 1 I will beable to produce 5 factorial but theproblem with just this is that ok wehave three numbers in black and twonumbers in red I 'm missing out number inred right so a much better way is let meinvite a six right here as well so letme rewrite five type of factorial as 6times 5 times 4 times 3 times 2 times 1so I 'm just putting down this this thatfactor for that but of course you knowthis right here I 'm changing the entirevalue of it that 's no goodbut it 's ok because I can just go aheadand divide it by the new factors namely6 4 and 2 like that and I can pretendnothing happenedit 's because they same value ok and nowcheck this out on the top this isnothing but just 6 factorial the colordefinition of factorialis n't it and now on the bottom 6 4 2right six times more times 2 that'sexactly how we just did and if you wouldlike I can rewrite this yes what this isthe same as that I will just put thisdown 2 to the third power times 3factorial so another way to writeviterbo factorial is just 6th factorialover 2 to the third power times 3factorial this is just a regularfactorials okay now how can we welldefinition for this though okay wellfirst of all if n is odd in this case Ihave n is equal to 5 right on the top Iwill just have a single factorial howcan we go from 5 to 6 well I just haveto add a 1 to it still on the top I willhave to have and plus 1 and then I willdo the regular factorial and then thisis going to be over okay I have 5 andthen 2 and os3 but you see that it wouldbe easy if you do caresix because 60 by by 2 that will give usthis 3 and this 3 n plus 1 is 6 when nis equal to 5 right so the bottom it'sgoing to be 2 but instead and divided by2 1 and it 's odd I would have to firstadd 1 so I can get to the 6 so the powerright here it will be plus 1 over 2 okayonce again for example if n is 5 whichis the uh number right in your situationI will plug in 5 into this and 5 plus 1is 6 divided by 2 that 's how we can getthe 3 ok and as you know this and thatmatch so I can just say x plus 1 over 2factorial so this right here is adefinition of a type of factorial when nis odd okaysome of you guys might not like thisbecause of why I said earlier it 's okbecause in this case I can also writedown the following if unless our I canwrite n is equal to 2 K and nowsometimes you can say plus 1 sometimesyou can say minus 1 for an odd numberright in this case we are actually goingto say minus 1 and the reason is becausewhen you have this kind of things I wantlearn to be what that 's the smallestsmallest positive odd number okay when nis 1 K is 1 ok anyway ok start with 1and then 2 3 4 5 and so on ok - ok - onetype of Vitoria okn is 2 K minus 1 plugging this into thisad minus 1 plus 1 can saw so you justhave to K factorial right so on the tophere we have 2 K gray color factoriallike this ok over plugging 2 K minus 1into this n minus 1 plus 1 can so thisnow - we also cancel out later so youjust have to - the case power and lastlyplugging 2 K minus 1 into this ad youjust get K as well because this and thathave to match so I will just have K andlet me put up an assist to make thisclearok factorial like this ok so dependingon how you were like this if you want tojust stick with and then use the topdefinition and if you want to rewrite itwith the K then use the patterndefinitions but anyway hopefully getslike this video and to make this studymore interesting I 'm going to leave yourquestion if your guests go today so besure you guys try the following questionyou [ Music ] test
