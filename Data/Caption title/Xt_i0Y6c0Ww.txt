the Monty Hall problem is based upon anold game show where contestants one ofthree doors behind one doors a new carbehind the two other doors are goats forthis video though we will be changingthe prizes there is a prize of 1 milliondollars behind at one of three doorsthere 's zero dollars behind the othertwo doors you pick one of three doorsthen one of the two doors you did notpick is opened that has zero dollarsbehind it you are then given the choiceto keep your door choice or switch tothe other remaining unopened door shouldyou keep your original choice or shouldyou switch doors does it matter whatactually does matter let 's take a closerlook at why it matters as an examplelet 's say you select door 1 there 's a1/3 chance the $ 1,000,000 is behind door1 which also means there is a 2/3 chancethe million dollars is behind door 2 ordoor three and now if you are shownthere are zero dollars behind door twothe question is should you keep yourfirst choice of door one or should youswitch your choice to door three wellbecause there 's a two-thirds chance themillion dollars is behind door 2 or doorthree and now you know the milliondollars is not behind door two there isnow a two-thirds chance the milliondollars is behind door three which meansyou should switch doors theoretically byswitching doors you have a 2/3 orapproximately 66.7 percent chance ofwinning 1 million dollars by keeping theoriginal door choice you have a 1/3 orapproximately 33 point 3 percent chanceof winning 1 million dollars to betterunderstand this let 's take a look at asimilar situation with more doors onceagain there is a prize of 1 milliondollars behind now one of 10 doors thereis zero dollars behind the other ninedoors you pick one of the 10 doors theneight of the nine doors you did not pickopened all eight have zero dollarsbehind them you are then given thechoice to keep your door choice or toswitch to the other remaining unopeneddoor again should you keep your originalchoice or should you switch doors soagain let 's say you select door onethere is a one-tenth chance the milliondollars is behind door 1 there 's a 9/10chance the million dollars is behind adoor numbered from 2 through 10 and nowif you are shown there are zero dollarsbehind door 2 through door 9again the question is should you switchyour choice to door 10 or keep youroriginal choice of door 1 becausethere 's a 9/10 chance the milliondollars is behind a door numbered from 2through 10 and now you know door 2through door 9 do n't have the milliondollars there is now a 9/10 chance themillion dollars is behind door 10 whichmeans once again you should switch doorsagain theoretically by switching doorsyou have a 9/10 or 90 % chance of winning1 million dollars by keeping theoriginal choice you have a 1/10 or 10 % chance of winning 1 million dollars onelast thing I do want to mention beforewe go is that the Monty Hall problem isnot the same as someone first showingyou one door that has zero dollars let'ssay this door here then making yourfirst choice and then being given thechance to switch doors this would be thesame as having just two doors to choosefrom if this was the case switchingdoors would not increase the probabilityof winningthere would be a 1/2 or 50 % chance ofwinning regardless of the door chosen orif you switched doors thank you forwatching The Monty Hall Problem: Switch Doors or Not?
