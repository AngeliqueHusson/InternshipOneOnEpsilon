si mon want take little bit departure looking specific ask question measure one thing came across study ing math notion measure mathematically measure going going show real number line yeah familiar right think real number line head question distance measure long section brad ha ran get brad ha ran know number need add get k know number know answer basically saying brad ha ran k well imagine n know answer imagine first time ever tried measure distance would brad ha ran make piece wood distance would take see many put k good like actually good brought reality going really bite going really bite like fact said basically said k well going look bit number line know length start going go drag measure another way could could say take number comfortable know distance take whats cal led naive naive naive way measuring number si hopefully going take rabbit hole point right going put little kind little bit choke wire around point agree exist brad ha ran happy happy length brad ha ran whats length well give length need start point end talking point point one point length point brad ha ran point n another way saying take use exactly logic used segment going use logic point like trivial maybe even annoying getting somewhere making point length point length line segment brad ha ran length still brad ha ran thing removed took right idea got line segment made continuous set point remove n change n change part reason behind real number line property next number number brad ha ran si mon yeah exactly even saying correctly way describe doesnt contain awesomeness going problem stuff n proved naive notion measure problem making almost broke math going almost broke math number line number line number line number line number line number line number line number line number line number line number line number line number line number line number line number line number line number line
