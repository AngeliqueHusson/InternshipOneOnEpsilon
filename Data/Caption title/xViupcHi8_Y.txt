welcome in a 9th grade 10th gradegeometry class we often give kidsformulas for volumes of surface areas ofcones and spheres and also stuff andthese volumes these forms just come outof the blue often which they told thatyou ca n't prove this formula requirescalculus therefore just believe it fornow and plug in numbers and just solvethese problems I do n't find that verysatisfying I 'd like to explain to kidswhere formulas come from and yes it doesrequire catalyst to get things doneproperly but what I like to do in thisvideo is give a really good convincingargument why the volume of a cone is 1/3of the volume of the cylinder in whichit sits so let me just briefly talkabout cylinders for a moment and thenwe 'll talk about currents next so here'sa cylinder all the cylinder is a Sunshape in some plane there 's a crazyshape with a concrete copy of that shapedrawn down below in another plane sohere it is I think you see what I'mdrawing so there is a cylinder kind ofcrazy but it has some weird base and acomrat base to the top now to get atheory of volume going most people liketo declare the volume of a cylinder issimply the area of the base area of thebase times its height so the how itwould be just however tall this thing isHSN like that ok fair enough that mightseem intuitively plausible it reallycomes from actually looking at boxeswhere we really believe that formulaexample here 's a rectangular box supposeI tell you it sirangels wide metres deep and see incheshigh most people say the bottom of boxwants to be ABC but what since a times Ba times B is really the area of the baseand then went times C which is theheight socialist volume here of otherbox which were very familiar with andreally like to believe is this formulaover yonder so the volume of cylindersjust generalizedwhat we 'd like to believe that boxesokay great but what I really want to getto here is if now I imagine I had a coneso I choose some kind point up here andI serve making a cylinder with that baseI now made a wacky cone with that basemaybe this is not very good picture herebut you know some sort of circus tentconstruction with a floor given by thatshapeapparently the volume of this cone isactually taking up 1/3 of the space is1/3 of the volume of the cylinder andthat 's kind of surprising exactly 1/3 nomatter what shape the base you have isalways 1/3 the shape of the of the thevolume of the solid are surrounding itthat 's the former electrics planealright now to do that I need to appealto some intuition that seems abelievable and it 's basically what'scalled Cavalier ease principle let meexplain it as far as so he goes imagineagain I 've got a cone and supposes anunusual basis but it might be quite aswacky this time there 's a cone with someunusual base and the nice thing aboutthis occurring as we 're measures like astack of papers at each level I 've gotanother stack which is just a scaledcopy of that particular base all the wayup to the top where that gets the verytop post piece of papers basically it'sequipment to point so there 's a stack ofpapers certain height with a strangeshape if over yonder I can choose areally nice cone I 'll make it atriangular cone and most teachers willcut me off right now because triangularcurrent should n't be called cones theyshould be called pyramids but it'sthrough the same construct and what I'mdoing is I do n't assume it 's it too is astack of paper and I 've arranged it sothe base of this you know the bottompiece of paper of this cone is the sameareas this bottom of the piece of paperis occurring on the left and sinceeverything 's scaled versions they'reafter the area of a slice of paper atone height is going to equal in thisarea a here will equal the area thiscurrent this slice of this level here soif each piece of paper at each heighthas the same area then it seemscompletely believable that this entirestack of paper has the same volume asthis entire stack of paper if it is eventrue for the cylinders around it if Ithink of those as decks of paper thistime in each height the areas exactlythe same of each piece of paper thenoops then I 'd like to believe that thevolumes of those two cylinders are goingto be the same as well because basicallyas layers of paper nothing 's changedeach paper at each height is the sameairtherefore the second pick with the NCAPthe same so if I 'd like to prove thatthis wacky current which I 'm nowoutlining in green is 1/3 the area ofthe cylinder which it 's it 's since I'vejust translated the problem to the samenumbers but made it nice for myself ifthis cone hat is the same area as thecurrent on the left sitting in acylinder the same volume as a cylinderon the left then proving the volume ofcone is 1/3 the bottom of cylinder willbe chromatid doing it for a niceparticular current and my cylinder sowhat I 'm going to do then is prove herethe volume of this cone is 1/3 thevolume of the cylinder prove it fortriangular cones means I 've proved itfor general cones since I 've met thevolume of the currents match the bottomsof cylinders match all right now thatwas hard that 's pretty fast too sorryabout thatmaybe we want to replace this video acouple times so we now reduce theproblem to that of triangular currentsthat is triangular pyramids now I need avery complicated picture which I 'm notvery good at drawing so I pre draw ithere is a triangular cone effect hereare three triangular cones Roman numeralone from normal to Rome numeral threeand I 've arranged them so they can stacktogether to make a nice triangularcylinder I claim if we look at thesethree cones I can prove all sorts ofgood things about itso here 's look at cone number one it hasbase B here 's base B drew through itgreen dots and here 's its height over inthe stack picture here 's its base andhere 's its height if you look at currenttwo it has the same base B and actuallyhere 's its height there which is theexactly the same height so here 's itsbase here 's its height so there arecones one and three at the same base andthe same height they 're really are goingto be you need to think in terms ofstacks pay that means all the papers arethe same all the way through they canhave equal volumes so that shows me thatvolume 1 equals volume 3 but if I lookat this picture again another way lookat currents numbers 1 and 2 current whohas this base a current one has thisbase a here they are his face a forcurtain 2 is base 8thone and in this picture it 's clear theyhave the same height over that height isso that means those that the currentsone and two again have the same basesame height which means all the stacksof papers going to be matching upperfectly so they can have two the samevolume so I can now conclude that volume2 equals body 1 or 1 equals to 2 equals3 therefore I can now conclude thatvolume 1 equals bottom 2 equals volume 3that has got three equal volumes thesethree cones on the Left have equalvolume and they stack together to make abeautiful cylinder so now look atcurrent number one it is a cone in acylinder there it is and we just provedit is one of three equal parts of thatcylinder that is the volume of this conevolume one must be one third of thevolume of the cylinder so that showsthat the volume of a triangular cone andthe fact that shows a very nice triangleoccurring I made sure all my bits ofpaper or right triangles this time isactually one third of the cylinder whichare contained in which it is containedthat does itvery tricky proof lot of work if youlike a challenge he goes I 'll give it togive you challenge and I 'll just leaveit at thatwe proved that the volume of a cylinderis area of the base times the heightwe 've got the vine with the cone is 1/3area the base times the heart there'ssomething in between the volume of aquestion mark which is 1/2 the basetimes the heart not many people see thisI 'll show you what it is it 's a cone orway to type things so here 's some crazybase so cylinder has a complete copy ofthe top the cone has a point for a topso there 's the cylinder there 's theCuran I need somebody 's halfway betweenthe whole shape at the top and a pointon the top and that 's gon na be a linesegment I claim if you somehow couldmake this shape now you see where I'mtrying to drawsaw like a pinched shape that 's pinchedalong a line at the top here I claimedthe volume of this guy is 1/2 the basetimes the height so my challenge to youis to prove that Formula for the Volume of a Cone: Video II (Tanton: Mathematics) Formula for the Volume of a Cone: Video II (Tanton: Mathematics)
