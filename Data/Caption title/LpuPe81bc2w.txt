modern-day computers use electricity towork and inside of a microchipelectricity is turned either on or offwhich is represented by the symbols 1and 0 this is called binary you'veprobably heard of binary already andthat that 's how computers work but doyou know how binary works well you'reabout to find out but first we need tounderstand exactly how our numericalbased system known as decimal or base 10works the way it does so there are 10counting 10 symbols that we use for allof our numbers starting from 0 we cancount all the way up to 9 before we runout of symbols to use now we could justkeep adding symbols at this point butthat would get out of hand very quicklyI mean can you imagine having tomemorize a specific symbol for everysingle number that 's ridiculous andthat 's why we reuse the same symbolsover and over again in a very cleversystem calledpositional notation so in the base 10system as soon as we get to 10 or anexponent of 10 we need to add anotherdigit to the left of our current digitbecause there are 10 symbolseach new digit has to have a value 10times greater than the digit to it'sright so that 's using 10 symbols butwhat if you had only 2 symbols to workwith well then everything that I saidstill applieswith just two symbols each new digitneeds to have a value 2 times greaterthan the digit to it 's right so asequence like this would equal 1 times128 plus 1 times 16 plus 1 times 8 plus1 times 2 plus 1 which is 155 and that'show you count in binary it 's actuallyreally simple it 's just multiplicationand addition now it gets a lot morecomplicated from here with bits andbytes and boolean logic and ASCII andthe list just goes on and on so let'sreturn to base systems there are a lotof ways to write numbers other thandecimal and binary you 've got base tobase 3 base for base 5 I could go onthey all work with the same principlesof positional notation so you might bewondering with all these numberingsystems to choose from why do we usebase 10 that 's a good question this goesall the way back to Roman numeralan Egyptian hieroglyphs it 's likely thatwe use base 10 simply because we have 10fingersalso known as digits other based systemslike base 8 and base 12 are actuallysuperior for simple everyday math since8 and 12 are much more easily divisiblethan 10 but it 's definitely too late tochange our minds about using base 10we 'll probably be stuck with it foreverswitching away from it now would be evenharder than trying to convince Americato drop the Imperial system and finallyswitch to metric you know like the restof the civilized world like yeah themetric system is superior but who'sgonna tell America what to do now ifyou 're going to be using base 12 or anyother base system with more than 10digits its standard to use letters torepresent numerals higher than 9 so 10is a 11 SB 12 is C and so on this iscalled alphanumeric you know those URLshorteners that you see on Twitter andelsewhere have you ever wondered howthey work all those jumbled charactersreally just represent a very largenumber by using numerals and everyletter of the alphabet you can get allthe way up to base 36 using lowercaseand uppercase letters gives you base 62and with that you can get all the way upto 14 million with only four digits withjust 10 digits you can get up to 839quadrillion possible values that 's a lotof shortened URLs so you just learnedabout positional notation binary numbersnumeral based systems alphanumericcharacters and URL shorteners I hope youenjoyed it and if you 're in the mood formore learning maybe you 'll like today'svideo sponsor which is the excellentlynda.com for the past six years I havebeen using and recommending lynda.com topeople as an excellent means of learningnew things especially software you seeover six years ago I wanted to learn howto use Photoshop so I googled around andas usual many of the software tutorialsI found just assumed that I hadpre-existing knowledge either that orthey 'd be out of date not have enoughpictures if any have unclear missing ordownright incorrect instructions worstof all I was having to piece everythingtogether based on multiple disparateinstructionfrom overlapping and sometimesconflicting sources of information andthen I discovered lynda.com which ispretty much the opposite of all of thatlynda.com has thousands of high qualityeasy to follow video
