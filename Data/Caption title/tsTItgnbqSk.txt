what is the logic behind theconstruction of a 30-degree angle wekept the compass on point B set it to aconvenient width and made this arc withthe width unchanged we kept the compassat point D and make a knock intersectingthe previous arc and again with the samelength we kept the compass at point Eand make a knock intersecting theprevious arc to get a how does thisangle measure 30 degrees let 's make afew segments we joined be e EI EI d ande D all these five lengths are equal asthey have been drawn with the samecompass width what is a quadrilateralwith four equal sides yes it 's a rhombusand what do we know about the diagonalsof a rhombusthey bisect each other at right angleslet 's call the diagonal intersectionpoint P and look at triangle b pd lengthpd will be half the length of IDI but iiD is equal to BD it implies that pd ishalf BD the converse of the 30-60-90theorem says that in a right triangle ifa site is half the hypotenuse then it isthe side opposite 30 degrees and that'show we get this angles measure as 30degreesyou test
