hey what 's up everyone welcome back tomashup math my name is Anthony and onthis lesson I 'm going to help you gainsome practice and develop somestrategies for working through thosereally tricky geometry proofs so let'sgo ahead and check it out hey what 's upgeometry students Anthony here thank youthank you thank you for joining me onthis lesson I 'm going to help you withthese geometry proofs I know they'remaking you crazy so let 's go ahead andwork through three different examples sothat you can better wrap your headaround how to strategize and completethese things now as is the case with anyof these proofs we always have a diagramsome given information and somethingthat we have to prove and we can provethings by applying what we already knowabout geometry to that given informationand the diagram as we construct alogical argument using a statement andreason table so in this example we wantto prove that triangle GfK is congruentto triangle hfj in other words we haveto show that that purple triangle is thesame size as the pink triangle we haveto show that they are congruent now weonly have one given here and that isthat line GJ and line HK bisect eachother at F and our reason of course isthat it 's given now to visualize this weknow that G J and K H those two linesegments bisect each other at point Fnow when they bisect each other they cuteach other into two equal halves so wecan conclude that segment GF iscongruent to j f and also that segmentKF is congruent to hfand our reason for saying this is thatthat is the definition of bisect next weshould notice that we have a pair ofvertical angles so we can say that angleGfK and angle hfj are congruent and ourreason for saying that they arecongruent is because they have verticalangles and we know that all verticalangles are congruent now at this pointwe should look at our diagram and askourselves do we have enough informationto prove that triangle GfK is congruentto triangle hfj and the answer to thatquestion should be yes because in eachtriangle we have two congruent sides andone congruent angle in between them sowe can use the side angle side postulateto prove the triangle GfK is congruentto triangle hfj and that proof istotally done now I bet I bet that youfeel a little bit better right now afterthat first one but let 's go on to a morechallenging one welcome everyone togeometry proofs level 2 now again onthis proof same structure as all theother ones that we 're ever going to lookat we have a diagram we have two piecesof given information in this particularproof and again we have to prove the twotriangles are congruent so first let'sidentify those two triangles so we wantto prove that triangle RSV is congruentto triangle ruv and we should see thatthose two triangles combined make up alarger right triangle so with that imagein mind let 's use the same strategy asthe last example and start with theGivens our first given is that our isthe midpoint of segment su so if wevisualize segment su with point R as themidpoint we should know that a midpointcuts a segment in half so we canconclude that s are and you areare congruent to each other and ourreason for saying that is the definitionof a midpoint because that 's whatmidpoints do now we ca n't really drawany more information with that firstgiven and since there are more than oneGivens in this example let 's go aheadand check the first one off and move onto the second one which says thatsegment SV is congruent to segment UV soSB + UV have the same length they arecongruent now once our Givens are allused up we have to apply what we alreadyknow about geometry and keep in mindthat we have to prove that that pinktriangle and that light green triangleare congruent now notice that both ofthose triangles share side VR sowhatever the length of VR is in the pinktriangle RSV it has to be the samelength in the light green triangle ruvso we can conclude that VR is congruentto itself VR and our reason for sayingthat is the reflexive property and nowit should be clear from our diagram thatwe can prove that triangle RS v iscongruent to triangle ruv by using theside-side-side postulate each triangleshares three pairs of correspondingcongruent sides and now we 're done withthis proof we have one more so let 's goahead and give it a shot ok so thisproof is going to be a little bit morechallenging but again same structure wehave our diagram we have some giveninformation in this case we have twoGivens and unlike the last two examplesin this one we have to prove that twoline segments are congruent to eachother not just two triangles so we'regoing to have an extra step here so inthis case we want to prove that segmentAEis congruent to segment de so we'lllabel AE in blue and de in greenso let 's go ahead and use our firstgiven that angle a and angle D arecongruentour second given tells us that angle 2and angle 3 are congruent so we 'll labelthat on the diagram as well so now thatour Givens are used up let 's go aheadand figure out more information fromthis diagram now we should notice thattriangle BCE has two congruent basedangles angles two and three that wasgiven so we should know that triangleBCE is isosceles because of the baseangle theorem so we can go ahead and addthat to our table now we should alsoknow that since triangle BCE isisosceleswe know that the sides opposite thecongruent angles are also congruent toeach other so we can conclude that B Eis congruent to CE e because that is thedefinition of an isosceles triangle nowyou may not be sure if that informationis going to end up helping you to provethat a II was congruent to de howeveralways label as much as you can you canalways just take things out of yourtable if you need to but the moreinformation that you can figure out theeasier the proofs are going to be foryou now we should also notice that inthose two smaller triangles B EA and CEDwe have a pair of vertical angles angle5 and angle 6 and we know that those twoangles are congruent because they'revertical and all vertical angles arecongruent and that was a very helpfulpiece of information because we shouldsee that in each of those yellowtriangles we have two consecutivecongruent angles followed by a congruentside in each one so you can concludethat triangle BAE and triangle CDE arecongruent by the angle-angle-sidepostulate now since the two linesegments AE and de that we wanted toprove were congruent from the beginningour part of those triangles showing thatthey are congruent allowsus to finish our proof statement and wecan say that a E is congruent to debecause corresponding parts of congruenttriangles are congruent so if the twoyellow triangles are congruent which wealready showed in the second to laststep of the proof we could conclude thattheir corresponding parts are alsocongruent as well and that 's all thereis to it you guys are done thank you somuch for joining me hopefully you likedour colorful and creative
