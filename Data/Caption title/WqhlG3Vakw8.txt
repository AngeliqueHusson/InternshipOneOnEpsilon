hi rob welcome math antic lesson gon na learn theorem theorem sometimes may wondering theorem world well math theorem simply statement proven true thing either known accepted true well really smart dude lived long time ago ancient proved theorem applause historian completely sure actually proved could one student usually get credit applause anyway main thing need know theorem describe important geometric relationship three sides right triangle gon na learn relationship minute first several thing need know truly understand theorem use solve understand theorem need know angle triangle also need know little bit exponent square topic new sure watch video second even though theorem geometry need know basic algebra actually use specifically need know variable sand solve basic algebraic equation involve cover lot topic first five video algebra basic got background covered let see theorem actually theorem stated several different ways one like best goes like right triangle leg b hypotenuse c squared plus b squared equal c squared see definition theorem apply triangle sit right know right triangle always include one right angle usually marked square help identify need know angle right angle help identify important side triangle cal led hypotenuse hypotenuse longe st side right triangle always side opposite right angle word side n touch help form right angle order use theorem need able identify hypotenuse variable c stand theorem c length hypotenuse side two sides triangle touch form right angle cal led leg theorem definition variable b represent matter leg cal led leg cal led b long keep track make initial know various part theorem let think relationship equation squared plus b squared equal c squared really telling telling us take length two leg sides b square mean multiplying squared times b squared b times b add two squared amount together equal amount get square hypotenuse side would c squared c times c may sound little first let take look special example right triangle help theorem make little sense right triangle cal led triangle sides relative length relative length mean length really matter sides could expressed inch es triangle could size long proportion relative starting side long call side get square side well arithmetic squaring mean multiplying times equal geometric equivalent squaring something actually result square shape see square contain unit red area represent value squared theorem next let look side long call side b squaring mean multiplying times geometric equivalent literal square side cover total area blue area represent b squared theorem finally let deal hypotenuse side c longe st side long squaring mean multiplying times geometric equivalent square area green area represent c squared theorem see arithmetic part theorem related geometric part right triangle let check see theorem really true least special case arithmetic side add amount squared b squared really equal c squared little rear ranging unit square see area square formed two equal area square formed hypotenuse wow ancient really smart know cool n even care theorem good well always good question answer like many thing math theorem useful tool help use know figure know specifically right triangle know long two sides theorem tell figure length third unknown side example imagine right triangle c long side c long side know long hypotenuse problem theorem tell us relationship three sides right triangle figure know squared plus b squared equal c squared let plug know equation solve know matter two leg cal led b let label like substitute b theorem equation give us algebraic equation one unknown c solve equation c word rearrange equation c one side equal sign know exactly c know length side triangle first need simplify left side equation since contain known number sand according order operation need simplify exponent first squared squared add result equation c squared c squared get c need inverse done since squared inverse operation square root need take square root sides taking square root c squared give us c want side equation give us little problem side easy figure square root perfect square going decimal probably irrational number fine leave answer square root sure could use calculator get decimal value really need one math common leave square root alone unless easy simplify sides right triangle c c square root try another example right triangle know length hypotenuse one leg length leg unknown let use theorem find unknown length usual call hypotenuse side c let call leg know side leg know side b substitute known value theorem solve unknown c give us equation squared plus b squared equal squared need simplify solve b first let simplify exponent squared squared need isolate b squared subtract ing sides equation side leave us b squared side minus solve simplified equation b taking square root sides give us b equal square root fine leave answer square root like may know square root simplified times square root going worry simplify ing root video know awesome know leave answer square root another interesting one unit square cut half along diagonal side square unit long far one corner square along diagonal well since diagonal square two right triangle use theorem tell us unknown distance label leg right triangle b hypotenuse c since know b plug theorem equation give us us squared plus squared equal c squared solve c squared left side equation plus mean c squared equal take square root sides get c equal square root far across diagonal unit use theorem find length unknown side right triangle common use another way use theorem want mention also use theorem test triangle see truly right triangle ya case already sure example someone show triangle ask right triangle well look lot like right triangle right angle symbol would hard tell angle exactly degree looking maybe really close like theorem tell us sure know length three sides triangle know length b c plug theorem equation see hold true particular case since two shorter sides c longe st side c plug value b c simplify see get squared side equation get plus side squared look right equation simplified equal definitely true statement mean three sides triangle work fit relationship squared plus b squared equal c since theorem tell us right triangle fit relationship triangle must right know theorem know use use find missing side right triangle also use test triangle see right triangle see take lot math skill able use theorem effectively may need brush skill ready try remember get good math watching video actually need practice real math always thanks watching math antic see ya next time learn math antic theorem math antic theorem math antic theorem math antic theorem math antic theorem
