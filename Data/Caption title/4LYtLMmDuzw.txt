They want us to subtract these two numbers and simplify theanswer and write as a mixed number.We 're going to do it two ways.The first way , we 're going to turn both of these intoimproper fractions and see what we get.And then the other way , we're going to subtract the wholenumber parts and then subtract the fraction parts and seewhat we get.So if we turn them both into improper fractions , let'sfirst turn 8 and 2/3 into an improper fraction.So it has 3 in the denominator , and3 times 8 is 24.24 plus 2 is 26.So 8 and 2/3 is the same thing as 26/3.And 5 and 5/6 , so we're going to subtract.We 're going to have 6 in the denominator.6 times 5 is 30.30 plus 5 is 35.So this simplifies as an improper fraction to 35/6.Now to subtract , we have to have a common denominator.3 and 6 are not the same denominator , but they are bothdivisible into 6.6 is the least common multiple of 3 and 6.So let 's turn them both into something over 6.So the 26/3 , if we put it over 6 , to go from 3 to 6 in thedenominator , we have to multiply by 2 , so we have todo the same thing in the numerator.We have to multiply 2 times 26 , which is 52.So it 's going to be 52/6 minus -- we do n't have tochange this one here in orange.It 's already over 6 -- minus 36/6 , which is going to beequal to -- what 's 52 minus 35 ? Let 's see , if you add 5 to 35 , you get to 40.15 will get you to 50 , and so we want 2 more , soit 's going to be 17.So it 's 17/6.This is as an improper fraction.Now , if we want to write it as a mixed number , we say howmany times does 6 go into 17 ? Well , 6 times 2 is 12 , so that works.6 times 3 is too big.It 's 18 , so it goes in two times.Now , if you take it into it two times , you get 12 , andthen you have 5 left over , right ? To go from 12 to 17 , you need 5 so you have 5 left over.You could say 6 goes into 17 two times , remainder 5 , so 17over 6 is 2 and 5/6.And we 're done ! Now this is kind of the improper fraction route , whichit 'll always work.It 'll always work.Sometimes it 's easier or harder , butit will always work.Actually , either route will always work , but I tend to doit this way.Let 's do it separating out the whole number and thefractional parts.So first we could view this as 8 minus 5.So let 's do this.8 minus 5 -- that 's subtracting the whole number parts -- plus2/3 minus 5/6.Now , 8 minus 5 , that 's easy.That 's 3.And then over here , though , we have an interesting -- well , let 's try to work it out.Let me do this in a different color.We want a common denominator here , and we already saw that6 is the least common multiple of 3 and 5 , so we could writethem both with 6 as the denominator.5/6 already has 6 as the denominator.We do n't have to do anything there.To go from 3 to 6 in the denominator here , we have tomultiply by 2 , so let 's do the same thing with this 2.2 times 2 is 4.So this results in 4/6 minus 5/6 , which will give us -- andwe have n't covered it yet -- a negative number.If you take 5 from 4 , you're going to go below 0.Now , if we do n't want to deal with that negative number , what we could do , and this is essentially the same idea asregrouping or borrowing , although they should n't callit borrowing , they should call it taking , is we canrewrite this 3.That 's why this can get a little bit tricky sometimes.Let me do it over here.Let me draw a line here so we do n't get the two ways ofdoing the problem confused.We can rewrite the 3 as 2 plus 1 , but instead of writing itas 1 , we could write it as 6/6 , right ? 6 over 6 is 1 plus 2 is 3.And then , if we add it to these guys , soplus 4/6 minus 5/6.Now , what happened by doing that ? Well , if we throw this 6/6 into the mix and then we hadthe 4/6 and then we subtract the 5 from it , then we'regoing to have a positive number , so let 's to do it.So we get this 2 right here.So it 's 2 plus , and then over 6 , we have 6 plus 4 -- let me write it.6 plus 4 minus 5.Now , what 's this going to equal ? This is going to be this 2 and what over 6 ? 6 plus 4 is 10 minus 5 is 5.So you have 2 and 5/6 , which is exactly what wegot the other way .
