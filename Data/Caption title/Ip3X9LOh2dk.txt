Hello , hello again.So , moving forwardI will be assuming you have a visual understanding of linear transformationsand how they 're represented with matricesthe way I have been talking about in the last few videos.If you think about a couple of these linear transformationsyou might notice how some of them seem to stretch space outwhile others squish it on in.One thing that turns out to be pretty useful to understanding one of these transformationsis to measure exactly how much it stretches or squishes things.More specificallyto measure the factor by which the given region increases or decreases.For examplelook at the matrix with the columns 3 , 0 and 0 , 2It scales i-hat by a factor of 3and scales j-hat by a factor of 2Now , if we focus our attention on the one by one squarewhose bottom sits on i-hat and whose left side sits on j-hat.After the transformation , this turns into a 2 by 3 rectangle.Since this region started out with area 1 , and ended up with area 6we can say the linear transformation has scaled it 's area by a factor of 6.Compare that to a shearwhose matrix has columns 1 , 0 and 1 , 1.Meaning , i-hat stays in place and j-hat moves over to 1 , 1.That same unit square determined by i-hat and j-hatgets slanted and turned into a parallelogram.But , the area of that parallelogram is still 1since it 's base and height each continue to each have length 1.So , even though this transformation smushes things aboutit seems to leave areas unchanged.At least , in the case of that one unit square.Actually thoughif you know how much the area of that one single unit square changesit can tell you how any possible region in space changes.For startersnotice that whatever happens to one square in the gridhas to happen in any other square in the gridno matter the size.This follows from the fact that grid lines remain parallel and evenly spaced.Then , any shape that is not a grid squarecan be approximated by grid squares really well.With arbitrarily good approximations if you use small enough grid squares.So , since the areas of all those tiny grid squares are being scaled by some single amountthe area of the blob as a wholewill also be scaled also by that same single amount.This very special scaling factorthe factor by which a linear transformation changes any areais called the determinant of that transformation.I 'll show how to compute the determinate of a transformation using it 's matrix later onin the videobut understanding what it is , trust me , much more important than understanding the computation.For example the determinant of a transformation would be 3if that transformation increases the area of the region by a factor of 3.The determinant of a transformation would be 1/2if it squishes down all areas by a factor of 1/2.And , the determinant of a 2-D transformation is 0if it squishes all of space onto a line.Or , even onto a single point.Since then , the area of any region would become 0.That last example proved to be pretty importantit means checking if the determinant of a given matrix is 0will give away if computing weather or not the transformation associated with that matrixsquishes everything into a smaller dimension.You will see in the next few videoswhy this is even a useful thing to think about.But for now , I just want to lay down all of the visual intuitionwhich , in and of itself , is a beautiful thing to think about.Ok , I need to confess that what I 've said so far is not quite right.The full concept of the determinant allows for negative values.But , what would scaling an area by a negative amount even mean ? This has to do with the idea of orientation.For examplenotice how this transformationgives the sensation of flipping space over.If you were thinking of 2-D space as a sheet of papera transformation like that one seems to turn over that sheet onto the other side.Any transformations that do this are said to `` invert the orientation of space . `` Another way to think about it is in terms of i-hat and j-hat.Notice that in their starting positions , j-hat is to the left of i-hat.If , after a transformation , j-hat is now on the right of i-hatthe orientation of space has been inverted.Whenever this happenswhenever the orientation of space is invertedthe determinant will be negative.The absolute value of the determinant thoughstill tells you the factor by which areas have been scaled.For examplethe matrix with columns 1 , 1 and 2 , -1encodes a transformation that has determinantIll just tell you-3.And what this means isthat , space gets flipped overand areas are scaled by a factor of 3.So why would this idea of a negative area scaling factorbe a natural way to describe orientation flipping ? Think about the seres of transformations you getby slowly letting i-hat get closer and closer to j-hat.As i-hat gets closerall the areas in space are getting squished more and moremeaning the determinant approaches 0.once i-hat lines up perfectly with j-hat , the determinant is 0.Then , if i-hat continues the way it was goingdoes n't it kinda feel natural for the determinant to keep decreasing into the negative numbers ? So , that is the understanding of determinants in 2 dimensionswhat do you think it should mean for 3 dimensions ? It [ determinant of 3x3 matrix ] also tells you how much a transformation scales thingsbut this timeit tells you how much volumes get scaled.Just as in 2 dimensionswhere this is easiest to think about by focusing on one particular square with an area 1and watching only what happens to itin 3 dimensionsit helps to focus your attentionon the specific 1 by 1 by 1 cubewhose edges are resting on the basis vectorsi-hat , j-hat , and k-hat.After the transformationthat cube might get warped into some kind of slanty slanty cubethis shape by the way has the best name everparallelepiped.A name made even more delightful when your professor has a nice thick Russian accent.Since this cube starts out with a volume of 1and the determinant gives the factor by which any volume is scaledyou can think of the determinantas simply being the volume of that parallelepipedthat the cube turns into.A determinate of 0would mean that , all of space is squished onto something with 0 volumemeaning ether a flat plane , a line , or in the most extreme caseonto a single point.Those of you who watched chapter 2will recognize this as meaningthat the columns of the matrix are linearly dependent.Can you see why ? What about negative determinants ? What should that mean for 3 dimensions ? One way to describe orientation in 3-Dis with the right hand rule.Point the forefinger of your right handin the direction of i-hatstick out your middle finger in the direction of j-hatand notice how when you point your thumb upit is in the direction of k-hat.If you can still do that after the transformationorientation has not changedand the determinant is positive.Otherwiseif after the transformation it only makes since to do that with your left handorientation has been flippedand the determinant is negative.So if you have n't seen it beforeyou are probably wondering by now '' How do you actually compute the determinant ? `` For a 2 by 2 matrix with entries a , b , c , dthe formula is ( a * d ) - ( b * c ) .Here 's part of an intuition for where this formula comes fromlets say the terms b and c both happed to be 0.Then the term a tells you how much i-hat is stretched in the x directionand the term dtells you how much j-hat is stretched in the y direction.So , since those other terms are 0it should make sense that a * dgives the area of the rectangle that our favorite unit square turns into.Kinda like the 3 , 0 , 0 , 2 example from earlier.even if only one of b or c are 0you 'll have a parallelogramwith a base aand a height d.So , the area should still bea times d.Loosely speakingif both b and c are non-0then that b * c termtells you how much this parallelogramis stretched or squished in the diagonal direction.For those of you hungry for a more precipice description of this b * c termhere 's a helpful diagram if you would like to pause and ponder.Now if you feel like computing determinants by handis something that you need to knowthe only way to get it down is to justpractice it with a few.There 's not really that much I can say or animate that is going to drill in the computation.This is all tripply true for 3-rd dimensional determinants.There is a formula [ for that ] and if you feel like that is something you need to knowyou should practice with a few matricesor you know , go watch Sal Kahn work through a few.Honestly thoughI do n't think those computations fall within the essence of linear algebrabut I definitely think that knowing what the determinate representsfalls within that essence.Here 's kind of a fun question to think about before the next videoif you multiply 2 matrices togetherthe determinant of the resulting matrixis the same as the product of the determinants of the original two matricesif you tried to justify this with numbersit would take a really long timebut see if you can explain why this makes sense in just one sentence.Next upI 'll be relating the idea of linear transformations covered so farto one of the areas where linear algebra is most usefullinear systems of equationssee ya then !
