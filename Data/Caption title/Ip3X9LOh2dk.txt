hello hello moving forward assuming visual understanding linear transformation sand theyre matrices way talking last think couple linear might notice seem stretch space squish inone thing turns pretty useful understanding one transformation sis measure exactly much stretch es squish es thing smore specifically measure factor given region increase example look matrix column scales hat factor scales j hat factor focus attention one one square whose bottom hat whose left side transformation turns rectangle since region star ted area ended area say linear transformation scaled area factor shear whose matrix column hat stays place j hat move unit square determined hat turned parallelogram area parallelogram still base height continue length even though transformation smush es thing seem leave unchanged least case one unit square actually though know much area one single unit square change sit tell possible region space whatever happen one square happen square grid matter size follow fact grid remain parallel evenly spaced shape grid square approximate grid square really well arbitrarily good approximation use small enough grid since tiny grid square scaled single amount area blob whole also scaled also single amount special scaling factor factor linear transformation area cal led determinant transformation ill show compute determinate transformation matrix later video understanding trust much important understanding computation example determinant transformation would transformation increase area region factor determinant transformation would squish es factor determinant transformation squish es space onto line even onto single point since area region would become last example proved pretty important mean check ing determinant given matrix give away weather transformation associated everything smaller dimension see next even useful thing think want lay visual intuition beautiful thing think need confess said far quite right full concept determinant allow negative would scaling area negative amount even idea orientation example notice sensation space thinking space sheet transformation like one seem turn sheet onto side transformation said invert orientation space another way think term hat starting position j hat left transformation j hat right orientation space inverted whenever orientation space inverted determinant negative absolute value determinant though still tell factor scaled example matrix column transformation determinant ill tell mean space get scaled factor would idea negative area scaling factor natural way describe orientation transformation get slowly let ting hat get closer closer hat get closer space getting meaning determinant approach es hat perfectly determinant hat continue way going doesnt feel natural determinant keep decreasing negative understanding determinant think mean dimension sit determinant matrix also tell much transformation scales time tell much volume get scaled easiest think focus ing one particular square area watching happen dimension sit help focus attention specific cube whose edge resting basis j hat khat transformation cube might get warped kind slant slant cube shape way best name name made even delightful professor nice thick russia n accent since cube start volume determinant give factor volume scaled think determinant simply volume parallelepiped cube turns determinate mean space onto something volume meaning ether flat plane line extreme case onto single point watched chapter recognize meaning column matrix linearly dependent see negative mean way describe orientation right hand rule point forefinger right direction middle finger direction notice point thumb direction khat still transformation orientation change dand determinant transformation make since left hand orientation determinant negative havent seen probably wondering actually compute determinant matrix b c formula b part intuition formula comes say term b c hap ped term tell much hat x direction term much j hat direction since term make sense area rectangle favorite unit square turns like example one b c parallelogram base height area still times loosely speaking b c b c much parallelogram diagonal direction hungry precipice description b c helpful diagram would like pause ponder feel like determinant something need know way get practice theres really much say animate going drill computation true dimensional formula feel like something need know practice matrices know go watch sal work honestly though dont think computation fall within essence linear algebra definitely think knowing determinate within kind fun question think next video multiply matrices together determinant resulting matrix product determinant original two matrices tried justify number sit would take really long time see explain make sense one sentence next idea linear transformation covered far one linear algebra useful linear system ya determinant essence linear algebra chapter
