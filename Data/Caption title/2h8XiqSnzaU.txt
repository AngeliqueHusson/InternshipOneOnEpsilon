Identify 15/8 , or 15 over 8 , as a properor an improper fraction.So this is actually just a good reviewof proper and improper fractions.And there 's a pretty easy way to identify them.You have a proper fraction if your numerator -- so this righthere is your numerator , the number on top.Let me just label them , numerator and denominator.You have a proper fraction if your numeratoris less than your denominator.And if you do n't have a proper fraction , you have an improper fraction.So your improper fraction is if your numeratoris greater than or equal to your denominator.And over here , actually , all the numbers are positive.But if you had some negative numbers here , then you would actually say the absolute value of the numeratoris less than the absolute value of the denominator , for a proper fraction.And the absolute value of the numeratoris greater than or equal to the absolute valueof the denominator for an improper fraction.So let me just write that down , justto be a little bit more particular here , because we could have negative numbers in either the numeratoror the denominator.Anyway , let 's go back to this problem.15 is clearly greater than or equal to 8.So 15 is greater than or equal to 8 , so we are dealing with an improper fraction . test
