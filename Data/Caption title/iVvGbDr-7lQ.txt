hey everybody welcome again to anotherone of my math videos in this video I'mgoing to teach you how to find the slopeof a line I 'm going to teach you how tofind the slope of a line given twopoints and I 'm also going to teach youhow to find the slope of a line giventhe graph and the first example I wantto get started with is by the slope ofthe line given the two points negative 1negative 2 and 3/4 and whenever you needto find the slope given two points youneed to use the equation y2 minus y1divided by x2 minus x1 and you noticethat you see an M on the left hand sideof the equation and M is another way towrite slope slope is always written withM so pretty much what that saying is theslope is equal to y2 minus y1 divided byx2 minus x1 and this first point righthere I 'm going to label this x value forthis first point this is going to be myX 1 the y-value for this first point I'mgonna label as my y1 and the x value forthe second point I 'm gon na label as my X2 and the y-value for my second pointI 'm gon na label as my y2 now in order tofind the slope it 's really just assimple as plugging in all your pointsinto the equation so our y2 minus y1 isgoing to be Y 2 which is 4 minus y1which is negative 2 I 'm gon na put aparenthesis because you never can havetwo negatives next to each other and ourX 2 which is 3 minus our x1 which isnegative 1 so whenever you have twonegatives next to each other they becomepositive and the numerator is just 4plus 2 which is 6 and the denominator isjust 3 plus 1 which is 4 and the 6 andthe 4 both have a greatest common factorof 2 so this can be reduced to 3 over 2so the slope of these two points ispositive 3/ - so what if your textbook instead ofgiving you two points to find the slopewhat if they give you a graph to findthe slope so that is the next type ofexample I 'm going to go over as you cansee I have the graph on the left handside of the screen and I use the sametwo points as we used in the firstexample and whenever you are given agraph to find the slope you can use theequation f equals the rise over the runand the rise is just how much it changesup and down and the run is just how muchit changes from side to side so what Ilike to do is start from the lowerpoints and in order to find the rise yousee the count how much it goes up so ifwe start up from this point and if wecount how much it goes up it goes up onegoes up two goes up three goes up fourgoes up five and then it goes up six sowe know that the distance that it goesup or the rise is six units so now inorder to find the run let 's see how manyunits it goes side to side so if westart from the point we left off and wecounts it goes over one goes over twogoes over three it goes over four unitsokay so our run is four units so ourslope is equal to our rise which is sixover our run which is four which onceagain can be reduced to three over twoand there 's one more thing that I wouldlike to point out and sometimes a slopecan be negative for this particularexample it 's positive and the reason whyit 's positive is because if you wouldstart from this point or start from theleft and you go right if you go from theleft and you go to the right and it getsbigger like in this example then it'spositive but if you start from the leftand you go to the right and the line isgoing getting lower or going down thenyou have a negative then it 's going tobea negative slope and there is one lastthing I would like to go over before I'mfinished with this video and that is thetwo special cases of lines and one ofthem is the horizontal line and one ofthem is the vertical line and I justwant to let you know that the slope ofany horizontal line is always going tobe zero and the slope of a vertical lineis always going to be undefined and theeasy way for me to remember this is tothink of arak if you have a horizontalrock that is flat completely flat thatis completely horizontal it 's possibleto walk on it okay because it 's flat andyou can just walk on the rock so if it'spossible to walk on it then it must havea slope if you have a rock that iscompletely vertical that 's pretty muchthe same thing as a cliff and it isimpossible to walk on it therefore itmust have no slope so the slope isundefined so that 's a way for me toremember it you could probably justmemorize it a horizontal line has aslope of 0 and a vertical line does nothave a slope it 's undefined these arethe two special cases that you shouldhave memorized so I hope this videohelps you understand slope just a littlebit better if you need any extra helpwith live tutoring or homework solutionsplease feel free to go to my website atmath meeting.com once again math meetingcom now I would love to help you outalso if you like my videos and you likemy style of teaching and you want to seesome more please subscribe to my youtubechannel now once again thank you so muchfor watching and take care Slope of a line Slope of a line Slope of a line
