hey everybody welcome another one math video video teach find slope line going teach find slope line given also going teach find slope line given graph first example want get star ted slope line given two point negative whenever need find slope given two point need use equation minus minus notice see left hand side equation another way slope slope always written pretty much saying slope equal minus divided minus first point right going label x value first point going x value first point label x value second point gon na label value second point gon na label order find slope really simple plugging equation minus going minus negative gon na put parenthesis never two negative next x minus negative whenever next become positive numerator denominator plus common factor reduced slope two point positive textbook instead giving two point find slope give graph find slope next type example going go see graph left hand side screen use two point used first example whenever given graph find slope use equation f equal rise run rise much change sup run side side like start order find rise count much goes start point count much goes goes one goes two goes three goes four goes five goes six know distance goes rise six order find run let see goes side side point left goes one goes two goes three goes four run four equal rise six run four reduced three two one thing would like point sometimes slope negative particular example positive reason positive point start left go right go left go right like example positive start left go right line going getting lower going negative going tobe negative slope one last thing would like go video two special case one horizontal line one vertical line want let know slope horizontal line always going tobe zero slope vertical line always going undefined easy way remember think horizontal rock flat completely flat completely horizontal possible walk flat walk rock possible walk must slope rock completely vertical pretty much thing cliff impossible walk therefore must slope slope undefined way could probably memorize horizontal line aslope vertical line slope undefined two special case memorize hope understand slope little bit better need extra help live tutor ing homework feel free go web site math would love help also like video like style teaching want see please subscribe thank much watching take care slope line slope line slope line slope line slope line slope line slope line slope line slope line slope line slope line slope line slope line slope line slope line slope line slope line slope line slope line slope line slope line slope line slope line slope line
