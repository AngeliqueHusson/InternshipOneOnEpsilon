[ Music ] [ Music ] hey guys it 's Robin here any goldfishand today we 're gon na show you arereally cool new way now you can usethese dots in boxes to do somethingfunctional addition so what we 're goingto be showing you I hope you like thatcan do addition is that it doesn'tmatter what basically the rule foraddition is always the same so let 's getstarted let 's get to itauditioning in any base machine thesetwo base machines could be any base itdoes n't really matter so long as theyare the same base adding them is easyjust combine the docks for code then usethe rule on any boxes that have too manydots okay let 's goour base to example 14 and 5 the firststep is working down to the left becauseit is based angle we 're using the rule 2goes to 1let 's hit hard all but now let 's do the5 okay so the secret code in base 2 for14 is 1 1 1 0 secret code for five andbase 2 is 1 0 1 now this is the onecolumn this is the tooth all this is the4th office 8th hole so let 's add up eachindividual color here we have a 0 a 1 soyah blows up get a 1 here male 1 and 0animals up here one in a 1 now we'redoing some working in to the left againlike that and there we have our is 14plus 14 plus 5 is 1 0 0 1 and that islike 16 plus a 2 plus a 1 which is 19and 14 plus 5 isso here we have a 14 you in a 5 justlike on camp when you bake 2 now so goon through base 3 Louise you all werethree on the way first one look so let'sstart with who lead us to leftalright so now we 'll move over to fiveokay so the basically code for 40 is 1 12 then basically code for 5 is 1 2now I 'm gon na add them so let me combinemy color all the docs in one box is goto this box all of the dots in the fleashome goes to this talk and all of thedots and the mines copper goes to thisbooks and now we 're gon na watch somethings to the left again use move pleaseotherwise click to 1 and now we can doit again all right now I am Oriental 14plus 5 equals to 0 1 we have 2 9 0 easeand a 1that adds up to 19 [ Music ] okay so look to the last base ten it dip [ Music ] so we have 749 264 now we combine thecolumns let 's now use the rule okay sowe 're in base 10 so we use the rule 10ghost 1 [ Music ] so we check one zero one three sevenhundred and forty-nine plus two hundredand fifty four is 1014 okayI 'm going to show you how the standardaddition process is the same as a dozenboxin method so let 's start on trade offwe have six and five yeah better yepwe get yeah it was up i'ma get Anila butwe 're not going to write it we 're gonnatake one of them keep here and carry theother one I 'll forgive you okay let'swork over here sticks at 5 then I pull11 so we do $ 11 [ Music ] they 're 11 ducks so but what 's insteadof waiting until the end to do use therule let 's do it nowok so we 're gon na get rid of ten ofthese and replace them oneso [ Music ] there okay now let 's go back onto thiswith one and you 're not in 10-0 we hadthat up for you to ten but zero oh okaynow on this side we have nine dots andzero so we 'll bring nine dots down hereone two three four five six seven eightno my gosh and one more foot becauseit 's a one over here okay here on thelast bomb eight one three and one thenit hits the pipe with three in a onesupport us let 's add four dots to we'realready oneokay find us it 's at 5:01 501 501 we gotthe same answer so these are actuallythe same process music from this videocomes from end sound I 'm gon na be addinga 5 and a 3 as you can see it 's a 4 and1 so this is a 5 and 201 so it 's a 3 nowwhat we 're gon na be doing is adding themso what you do is all the 1 is go tothis little soft so all of the tools goto this box sorry bunny just nudged meand all the bowls go to this and now wecan use our wall - I 'm the light equalto 1 on the left and hey look we can doit again and one more time and now herewe have 1 1 0 0 0 that 's the code rate 5plus 3 equals 8 [ Music ] Addition | Addition in 1 â† 2, 1 â† 3 and 1 â† 10 Machines | The Traditional Algorithm Addition | Addition in 1 â† 2, 1 â† 3 and 1 â† 10 Machines | The Traditional Algorithm Addition | Addition in 1 â† 2, 1 â† 3 and 1 â† 10 Machines | The Traditional Algorithm
