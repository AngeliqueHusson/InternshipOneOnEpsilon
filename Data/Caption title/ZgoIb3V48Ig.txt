given triangle right angled vertex b measure angle degree c measure degree need prove prove side opposite degree half length hypotenuse b c equal half c prove figure tell us anything little bit construction find way c b like b c equal b length equal length join ad like extended c b angle also degree construction interested length b c construction know b c equal mean b c half manage prove c equal done proof let look triangle triangle two triangle b c equal b based construction b c equal b equal angle degree b equal b common side side angle side therefore triangle congruent triangle congruence condition corresponding part congruent triangle always congruent angle ad b equal angle corresponding angle given degree angle also sixty degree angle ba also equal angle bac corresponding angle angle bac given angle ba also equal thirty degree together form angle get measure angle sixty degree snow look triangle ad c equal sixty degree say triangle ad c equilateral sides equilateral triangle equal therefore c equal c got looking b mid point segment equal twice b c equation written times c side get b c equal half c triangle length side opposite degree angle always half length hypotenuse converse also hold true see coming prove triangle theorem prove triangle theorem prove triangle theorem prove triangle theorem prove triangle theorem prove triangle theorem prove triangle theorem prove triangle theorem prove triangle theorem prove triangle theorem prove triangle theorem prove triangle theorem prove triangle theorem prove triangle theorem prove triangle theorem prove triangle theorem prove triangle theorem
