so let 's say we have three beingmultiplied by two over fifteen so manypeople get confused when they see awhole number being multiplied by afraction but we actually are stillmultiplying two fractions togetherbecause three is exactly the same asthree over one if you divide anything byone and never changes so we actually arestill multiplying two fractions togetherthe first thing I 'm going to do ismultiply our numerators together threetimes two which is just six and now I'mgoing to multiply our denominatorstogether one times 15 which is just 15and our answer can actually be reducedthe six and 15 have a common factor ofthree they both can be divided by threeevenly so I 'm going to divide the six bythree and whatever you do to the top youhave to do to the bottom so I 'll dividethe 15 by three and we have a finalanswer of six divided by three in ournumerator which is just two and 15divided by three in our denominatorwhich is just five so here we have afinal answer of two over five and manypeople like to solve these problemsusing a simple shortcut I 'm so I 'm goingto go back and solve this problem usingthat shortcut where essentially we'rejust simplifying the diagonals from solet 's go back here to where we have 3over 1 multiplied by 2 over 15 noticehow in the diagonal we have one numberin the top left of 3 and another numberof 15 on the bottom and notice how bothnumbers have a common factor of 3 theyboth can be divided by 3 evenly so whatyou could do is you could divide the 3by 3 which is just 1 and you can dividethe 15 by 3 which is just 5 so now inour numerators we have a 1 multiplied by2 so we have 1 times 2 in our numeratorand then our denominator our one is nowbeing multiplied by a 5so in our numerator we have 1 times 2which is just 2 and in our denominatorwe have 1 times 5 which is just 5 andonce again we have a final answer of 2over 5 so here are some more videos withsome more example problems related tothe video you just watchedI really hope you 're finding mytutorials helpful so until my next videoI will see you later Multiplying Fractions 2 Multiplying Fractions 2 Multiplying Fractions 2
