in a recent video we discussedpolynomial equations or functionsbasically anything that looks like thisX raised to a power we explained if yougraph these things the solution or theroot or the zero to that polynomial canbe easily seen as the point or pointswhere the plot crosses the x axisprofessor Eisenbud also showed us thatan equation to an odd power must haveextreme points down here and up heremeaning at some point it must cross thex axis so all polynomials to an odddegree have at least one root among thereal numbers may be more if we get alittle kink like this great but whatabout even degreed polynomials forexample this one well that 's never goingto cross the x-axis I mean are therepolynomials for which there are nosolutions or strap yourselves in becausethinking about that is leading ustowards one of the most importanttheorems in all of mathematics let 's doitso I 'm going to start with that equationthat equation of even degree that didn'thave any roots f of x equals x squaredplus one and that 's not lost causethat is not a lost cause people probablyhave heard of the square root of -1 is avery famous mathematician Sir Michaelattea who says that the square root of-1 I is the most important singleinvention in all of mathematicsit certainly solves this equationbecause if I claim that I have I equalssquare root of -1 then by definition Iis a root of that polynomial but thereis no oil here we have n't got we haven'tgot an I so we have to find out where Ilive and by the time of Gauss in 1800 itwas pretty well understood that youshould think of a plane of numberscalled the complex plane and if you putin axes there will be a real axis and acomplex and one wo n't be in itscomfortable place there and I will behere and you can do ordinary arithmeticon these things you write some numberpeople usually use Z for some reason forcomplex numbers so Z would be a certainreal part a and a certain imaginary partmaybe B and then I would write Z equalsa the real part plus bi the imaginarypart and complex numbers you multiplythem just the way you think if I want tomultiply 1 plus 2i times 2 minus I let'ssay and I just multiply them in partsjust as you would an algebraicexpression if I were X you can doarithmetic so I can plug any complexnumber the things in this plane arecalled complex numbers things like Z Ican just plug them into any polynomialand I get another complex number becauseI can multiply them and I can add themto do all the things that I have to doI can also divide them and they satisfyall the comfortable laws of arithmeticlike commutativity a times b istimes a and all those things I get butjust comfortable arithmetic and I canuse them in polynomials if I do this Imight want to separate the source of thepolynomial the place where the exes livewith the values the place where the f ofX is live so I 'm going to use a redplane for that one and now if I draw itlike this so here 's the again real axisand the imaginary axis let 's call theimaginary axis not because it isn'tthere it 's just as real as the real axisbut the numbers on it are the pureimaginary numbers the ones without anyreal part and then I can do things likesquaring the number I can for example Icould square I and I would record thevalue of the square over here so forinstance if my polynomial F let 's usegreen for the polynomial so if I have Fof a blue X is a red x squared forinstance then F of I would be I squaredwhich by definition is minus one so Iwould I would say that if sort of takesthis point on the real axis over herehere 's here 's F the green line over tothe minus one point there so I think ofF as taking each point in this plane tosome point in that plane so if I want tothink about the roots of a polynomialnow a polynomial is one of these thingsthat takes a point here to a point hereand the roots are the points in the blueplane that it takes to the zero point inthe red plane right in the middle of thearticles right in the middle right herezero that 's our goal here 's thefundamental theorem of algebra it saysthis is dooty Gauss again I 'd like towrite the word theorem about 18-hundredI forget the exact date he 's prettyhappy that gap Scott was n't he waspretty good yeah people always like tosay well he 's no cows but that 's not anot much of an insult anywaythe theorem says thatany polynomial with complex coefficientscan i spell coefficients yes havingdegree D that is the polynomial not thecoefficients has at least one complexroot but actually it follows from thatthat it has d complex roots computedwith multiplicity but let 's just say hasat least one complex root and we don'thave to talk about multiplicities andthis is the fundamental theorem ofalgebra because it 's the basicconnection between algebra and geometryroots are points somewhere so they'regeometric objects and polynomials arealgebraic objects so this is this is theconnection and makes one without a breakgeometry work it makes me happy becauseI 'm an algebraic geometer it gives mesomething interesting to do so whatyou 're saying is there 's no polynomialthat I could concoct that you wouldn'tbe able to find roots for as long asyou 're allowed to have complex numbersin your tool belt that 's right exceptfor you 're saying that I could find themI 'm going to show you they exist I 'm notgoing to find them for you if you wantto actually find the root then Newton'smethod of fastest descent things thatnumerical methods are very powerful butit 's hard to find roots of polynomialsmuch harder than proving they exist soI 'm just going to prove they exist sohow can we do that we ca n't do thistrick with lines but we can do a trickthat 's a lot like it and for that I haveto explain something about what happenswhen you multiply complex numbers so Ithink of a complex number here 's my bluecomplex plane and here 's a complexnumber so I think of it I like to thinkof it as a vector drawn from the originand if I think of the vector the vectorreally has a length and then once I'vetold you the length which is called theabsolute value of the complex number soZ so if you know the Pythagorean theoremyou know the length of this vector hasgotten by taking the square of the realpart plus the square of the imaginarypart and taking the square root of thatso it 's so if Z is a plus bi and theabsolute value of Z I 'll write it asthat magnitude it 's called is the squareroot of a squared plus B squaredjust Pythagorean theorem now there'sanother thing that you need to determinewhere that vector is and that 's theangle let 's call it theta let 's say weknew that the magnitude was 1 then wecould compute the sine of theta and thecosine of theta and if the magnitudewere 1 if this were of length 1 then thesine which is the opposite side over thehypotenuse would just be the oppositeside of the triangle which is theimaginary part and the real part wouldbe the cosine of the angle so when Imultiply things multiply complex numbersI 'm doing these tricks with the real andimaginary parts some should think ofthat as something happening to sines andcosines and if you remember your highschool trigonometry which I certainlydo n't then there 's some addition law forsines and cosines and it comes out tosaying this if I take two complexnumbers Z and a W here 's W and I taketheir the angles let 's call that one sythen when I multiply them I multiplytheir lengths I multiply the magnitudesand I add the angles so I would take syand then I would add theta to it and Iwould get something this way and thelength would be out here someplace rightso this is Z times W so it 's really easyto multiply complex numbersgeometrically you just multiply thelengths and add the angles and add someformula which you can figure out put itsI 'm going to take it for grantednow we 're ready to go and I want to takean arbitrary polynomial do you have moreof this nice paper Bradyand I want to think of this as goingfrom a blue complex plane here 's onehere 's I to a red complex plane say Davebefore we go to video before when youwere doing this right we had two axesyes here you 're representing to eat thisthis is one axis and this as the otheraxis if we want to make a real graphlike that we need to do it in fourdimensional space and it 's hard toimagine four dimensional space I want tograph this function I want to tell youwhat happens when I buy X and I want tofind the point here which we 're at leastto convince you that there is a point ablue point which will go to zero on thered side so that 's what I wantwhere is that point going to come fromhow am I going to find a point whichdoes that for one exists to prove oneexists so I start by scratching my headand thinking I do n't know anything aboutthis polynomial just like before but Ido know that the I do know the leadingterm that 's X to the N and I know if Xis very big that 's likely to be dominanton the other hand if X is very small Ican do something - if X is zero then thevalue will be seen so I know that thezero point over here in the blue planegoes to C over in the red planet sohere 's a nice red C let 's say C is downhere C is a complex number so it 's justsomeplace in that plane and I know that0 goes there now that 's not terriblyhelpful because I wanted to get a pointto go to 0 not to go to seeso what get whales do I know I I knowthat just as before if I take X to haveenormous ly large magnitude then X tothe end we 'll have that magnitude to thenth power that 'll be much much muchbigger the next to minethe N minus one so for really large X'stakes is way out and a big big circlearound this those are the X is with bigmagnitude so this is magnitude of X muchbigger than 0 and now it 's a circlebecause it could have any argument itcould have any angle I know that X tothe N will be even bigger I 'm going toshrink the scale on this red plane sothat I do n't have to draw it off the offthe table but it 'll go to some hugecircle now what will happen when I takeX and I take a walk with X I think of itas a dog on a leash and I lead it aroundthe circle so we know what happens themagnitude remember I 'm pretending thatthis polynomial is X to the end becauseit 's like exeunt the magnitude will staythe magnitude of X to the end the samething it was before so we will walkaround this circle and the realpolynomial will stay close to the circleit 'll sort of dance around like a dogwould on a leash after all it'ssomething else is happening though as Imove X around this one moves n times asfast because I 'm multiplying the anglesby n so it actually goes around n timesfor the purposes of this proof it'senough to good to know that it just goesaround but we 'll see why the N isimportant there too so as I move aroundhere once I move around the circleactually many times okay that was nicebut did it help not obviousnow comes the trick here 's the rest ofthe proof once you see this you you justknow it 's right I 'm going to shrink theblue circle down to the point 0 littleby little and I 'm going to watch whathappens on the right hand side on theright hand side this circle and rememberthe real values of the function we'redancing around this circle somehow butthere are nice continuous curve thatmeets up to itself again this circlewill begin to shrink too because I knowthat when x is zero or very small thiscircle has to be very close to C sosomehowthe circle shrinks down in alldirections in some very uneven way butat the end of the day it forms a littlecircle around C if X is performing alittle circle around zero now in thatprocess somewhere this this circle hasto pass through the origin and that'swhere I catch my roots so somewherealong the line as it shrinks I have tosee a picture like that and that 's thepoint which is which I was looking forthat point happened maybe from over hereand it will be a point on a small sortof smaller circle here where thisfunction actually goes to zero where ithas zero value we said that it reallygoes around n times so actually thispath is going around n times and as Ishrink it will keep going around n timesso there 'll be n of these curves that gothat move through the point one at atime or maybe all at once and so they'llbe actually n roots and so that 's thefull fundamental theorem of algebraif
