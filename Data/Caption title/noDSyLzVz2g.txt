JAMES CLEWETT : What we 've done is I 've got a radiation sourcewhich is emitting a constant stream of electrons.As neutrons are decaying into protons , out pops an electron , and I 'm counting not how many it 's giving out , but how manyof them are going into the Geiger counter.That 's a slightly different number.MALE SPEAKER : And what kind of ballpark figures are wetalking here ? JAMES CLEWETT : Well -- MALE SPEAKER : You must know because [ INAUDIBLE ] .JAMES CLEWETT : Yes.So it 's about 20 per second going into the Geiger counter.And then I 'm feeding that into this little box , which is justturning that number into a voltage.So these two wires are collecting that voltage , andthey 're passing them into the oscilloscope , where we can seethe pulses as they go by.Each pulse represents one electron.And electrons are all the same , so those pulses are allthe same height.And so as those pulses flash by , I 'm counting them , thecomputer is counting them.So the wire comes out of the oscilloscope , it goes throughthis little breakout box and into the back of the computer.You can buy one of these things for about 200quid , by the way.They 're worth having.Into the back of the computer , and then I 've written a littlecomputer program.And all the computer program does is sit there for 10seconds and count pulses.That 's it.It 's really simple.It 's all graphs today.Here 's time along here , and the stream of electrons lookssomething like this as they're coming out , and they'rerandomly distributed , which my stream of electrons absolutelyis n't there.It 's getting less random by the second.And all I 'm doing is I 'm counting.So I start with a value of 0 , and then I get to this time , and I 'm adding 1.I get here , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , and so on.And this is where the probability bit comes inbecause the chances are that over 10 seconds -- remember this graph ? So the most likely number that we 're going to get here -- I measured this this morning -- is 216.MALE SPEAKER : Over 10 seconds ? JAMES CLEWETT : Over 10 seconds.And that 's just an empirical measurement.So I 'm taking the number that I 've counted up , and I 'm goingto subtract off 216.What we 've just seen , and whether the answer was 13 , then obviously either I 've come in here -- and I 'm going to get this right -- I 've had 229 , or it could equally be that I 've been hereand had 203.Both of those are going to give the answer of 13.So the reason that 's happened is I was n't interested inshowing you a negative random number.I wanted to show you an integer value , a positiveinteger value.So I just wrote a piece of software whereI squared it up.I took the square root.The square root 's inevitably positive , and so my softwareis always going to give a positive answer.I cheated.OK , I admit it.I cheated.But the answer is 13.So you want some more numbers , right ? OK , well I 'll generate a few more.MALE SPEAKER : Let 's do 10 and write them downas they come out.JAMES CLEWETT : All right.Yeah , good idea.MALE SPEAKER : Oh , a big one.Or is that big ? We do n't know yet ? JAMES CLEWETT : We do n't know yet.So should we start with the 0 and the 13 , or do you want tojust start with the 13 ? MALE SPEAKER : No , put them.So we 've got a 0 , a 13.JAMES CLEWETT : So we have had 0 , we 've had 13.Now , we have 27 , 5.MALE SPEAKER : They should do the lottery like this.JAMES CLEWETT : They really should use radiation sourcesfor the lottery.Nobody would be cheating , for sure.It does n't quite have the razzmatazz of the lottery.44 , last seen three weeks ago today.MALE SPEAKER : Hang on a second.This would be a bad way to do the lottery because somenumbers here are more likely than other ones.JAMES CLEWETT : Right.That 's a really good point that you 've made.There 's some maths which I left out of this video becauseI thought it was going too far , where you can turn aGaussian distribution into a uniform distribution.So you can take your Gaussian distribution of randomnumbers , and you can flip it around and give them all auniform probability.Now , I do n't want to do the maths for you because thatwould be painful for everybody , but it works.And so you can , then , generate a uniform probability sequenceof numbers.MALE SPEAKER : But we have n't done that.JAMES CLEWETT : That's absolutelynot what we 've done.What we 've done is we 've taken a Gaussian distribution , andso some numbers -- 0 , basically -- are going to be more likely than others.I 'm really quite enjoying this.It 's very satisfying.3.I 'll run another one.We 'll count up.So the computer , again , is counting 200ish electrons , andthis is the deviation.6 is the deviation from the mean.And because it 's got a Gaussian distribution , thesmaller numbers are more probable.So if we keep doing this , what we 're going to end up with isvery heavily weighted to the small numbers.It 's actually quite surprising to me that we haven'tseen 0 again yet.I should say this morning -- 9 , excellent.This morning before you arrived , I ran thousands ofthese just to check that it was Gaussian , not that naturewas suddenly going to do something different.So the computer is counting the number of electrons thatstrontium 's putting out , and in this case , it 's either putout 20 more than the average number of electrons , or it'sput out 20 less.I ca n't tell because I've hidden that in my code.But it 's 20 away from the average.So in the science of statistics , this is -- 10 , excellent.In the science of statistics -- sorry.MALE SPEAKER : That's all right.Can you have George [ INAUDIBLE ] something ? JAMES CLEWETT : On your head be it , George.Thank you.19.So that 's 19 more or less electrons than the averagevalue that the strontium's putting out.So in this case , it 's been quite an active 10 seconds forthe strontium.OK , 13.MALE SPEAKER : We've got 13 again.We have n't got a 0 again.JAMES CLEWETT : No , it 's surprising.Anyway , so this is the proof of it.It could well be that I got the mean in the wrong place.That would explain it.And eventually , that would show up.So there 's one last thing I'd like to show you , and that isessentially -- well , let me just show you , and then I can talk about it.I 'm going to run the experiment 1,000 times over , and let me make that nice and big.So each one of these pulses that you can see appearing , that 's one number that we 've generated.And as you can see , we're generating more and morenumbers , and each time , I'm adding 1 to this pulse.And so the most likely number at the moment is 20.MALE SPEAKER : It 's not 0.What does this tell us ? JAMES CLEWETT : This tells us that I got the mean wrong.So if I had got the mean right , then thisvalue would be 0.What this means is that I got the mean wrong probablyby 20 , which is -- MALE SPEAKER : The mean being what ? JAMES CLEWETT : What this means is that I 've got the meannumber of electrons that this thing 's giving out in 10seconds , I got that completely wrong , which is a bitembarrassing.But you can see now that it 's starting to takethis Gaussian form.So it started off just as a couple of pulses , and you'dnever have known that there was a Gaussiandistribution to that.But over time , it grows into a really nice , bell-shapedgraph , and we can see that the most likely number that we'regoing to generate has moved up a bit from 20now , it 's about 22.MALE SPEAKER : That also means when we ran the experimentearlier , and we got 0 as our first result , that wasactually quite an unlikely result.JAMES CLEWETT : Yeah , absolutely.So that would mean that effectively , 0 was more like a20 result , and all of the 20s and 19s that we got and the 27that we got before , these were much more likely.So it was n't perfect , but it was all right , I think.And I think that we got a nice random number from it , so I'mpretty pleased.MALE SPEAKER : So that was still random.This does n't effect the randomness of the numbers.JAMES CLEWETT : No.Again , this goes back to the semantics of it.It 's random , yes , but it has a particular probabilityassociated with choosing that number.So at the moment , the probability of choosingsomething less than about 8 is 0 , and the probability ofchoosing something more than 38 is 0.If we go for a very , very long time , an infinitely long time , then these numbers will become nonzero , but they 're going tobe very close to 0.MALE SPEAKER : We 've got a little outlier there down near40 , do n't we ? JAMES CLEWETT : It 's quite satisfying just watching thisgraph draw itself over time.The question is , how much time do you have ?
