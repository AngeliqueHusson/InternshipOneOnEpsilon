hello professor v welcome u last several lecture explore concept binary relation saw set ordered pair form binary relation sometimes refer red graph relation binary relation r graph would set ordered pair real c artesian used visually represent ordered pair real way visually represent graph relation set ordered pair useful trying understand two may related example could correlation height weight member us men national soccer team let start making table height weight player create collection ordered first element ordered pair player height second element weight collection ordered pair form binary relation domain relation set height value sand range set several height weight value listed domain range domain range set every member set must unique member set may listed let graph relation c artesian ordered pair plot position first horizontal axis second vertical axis since height weight positive eliminate everything except first quadrant graph mark horizontal axis increment zero vertical axis increment zero pound snow starting first ordered pair locate value first horizontal axis second vertical axis point corresponding height weight first soccer player horizontal vertical position likewise ordered pair corresponding second player point horizontal position vertical position remain ing ordered pair plotted way notice point close together take small portion graph however scale graph point spread area easier see graph ing positive value necessary start axes zero example could make first division horizontal axis first division vertical axis finite set ordered pair cal led scatter scatter allow us visually detect may exist relation two example scatter plot apparent general trend weight player increase height summarize correlation two drawing cal led trend line example illustrate mathematics cal led positive correlation since average player height increase weight height increase weight weight would negatively correlated trend height weight apparent would say uncorrelated data point grouped closely trend say strongly correlated data point grouped loosely around trend line say weakly correlated trend line sometimes cal led line best fit various ways draw line general trend line drawn way minimize distance line data way draw trend line simply estimate position seem fit data point best similar trying build straight road comes close possible several different optimum path might one minimize sum road townsman spread sheet program scientific calculator shave function mathematically calculate trend minimize vertical distance data common method least square method minimize sum square vertical useful characteristic different instance graph weight versus height us men national soccer team blue weight height random sample men red would see weight height soccer team much tightly grouped random sample one reason could us national soccer team player sare better shape average person one important type binary relation often encounter special type relation cal led function next lecture see create allow us visualize analyze many type interesting useful relationship algebra scatter algebra scatter algebra scatter algebra scatter algebra scatter algebra scatter algebra scatter algebra scatter algebra scatter algebra scatter algebra scatter algebra scatter algebra scatter algebra scatter algebra scatter algebra scatter algebra scatter algebra scatter algebra scatter algebra scatter algebra scatter algebra scatter algebra scatter algebra scatter algebra scatter algebra scatter algebra scatter
