okay I wanted to talk about the numberII and why we use it as a base forexponential functions why is it sospecial so I 've drawn a picture here thegraph of an arbitrary exponentialfunction f of X equals B to the X that'sthis graph in purple and I 've also drawnits tangent line at the point 0 1 nowwhat I 'd like to do is I 'd like toexplore the relationship between thebase B and the slope of the tangent linein order to do that I 'm going to use ademonstration from geometers sketchpadokay so you can see I 've got graphed thefunction G of x equals two to the X hereit 's actually being the X but I canchange the value of B to any value Iwant that graph is in red and then thegraph of the tangent lines in blue rightnow the slope is point six nine threelet me move this tangent line aroundnotice as I move the tangent line it'sstill tangent at the point 0 1 but as Imove the tangent line around the basechanges as I move it to the tangent lineis less steep the base gets smaller as Imove it to the tangent line is moresteep the base gets bigger and if Imoved it so that the tangent line had anegative slope the base is between 0 & 1okay let 's take a look at someparticular values when B equals 2 againthe slope is point 6 9 3 when B is 3 theslope is one point zero nine nine sothat makes me wonder where 's the slopeequal to 1 is it two point five no twopoint seven five no it turns out that ifI want to get the slope to be exactlyoneI need B to be 2.71828 it 's this numbere it 's the only base that will make itso that 's the tangent line has a slopeof exactly one at zero oneokay so let 's summarize what wediscovered if B is greater than one thenthe slope of the tangent line ispositive if B is between 0 & 1 and theslope slope of the tangent is negativeif you want the slope to be exactly 1you need B to equal e and E isapproximately 2.71828 so that is alittle glimpse into what makes thenumber e special now let me give you adefinition for the number ehe has a very complicated definitionit 's a limit as n approaches infinity of1 plus 1 over N to the N now to help youunderstand this definition a little bitbetter I 'm going to calculate somevalues for this expression 1 plus 1 overN to the N so I 'll make a little tablelet me start with the value 1 when Nequals 1 I get 1 plus 1 over 1/2 to the1 so I get 2 and anything past that I'mgoing to need my calculator so let me dothis alright so when I plug in 10 I'mgetting 1 plus 1 over 10 to the 10thpower according to my calculator it'sapproximately two point five nine threeseven if I plug in 100 I get one plusone over a hundred to the 100th powerit 's approximately two point seven ohfour eight I 'm going to keep going up bypowers of 10 so a thousand I get I 'm notgoing to write this out anymore twopoint seven one six nine two how about amillion2.71828 so you finally get someconvergence once you get n up to amillion it takes quite a while for thislimit for this limit to start gettingreally close for this value to startgetting really close to e but rememberthat e 's defined as the limit of thisexpression so the value that thesevalues are heading towards e as n goesto infinity test
