in the last section we learned how toconvert some special base ten fractionsinto decimals and vice versa now we'regoing to learn how to convert anyfraction into a decimal and it turns outto be really simple all you have to dois divide since a fraction is reallyjust a division problem if you go aheadand do the division you 'll get an answerand that answer will be the decimalvalue of the fraction now there 's twoways we can do the division the easy wayand the hard way no just because I meanwe 're gon na start with the hard waylet 's take the fraction 1/2 and convertit into a regular division problem withthis division symbol now all we have todo is follow the procedure for divisionwe just see how many times this 2divides into this one oh wo n't divideany times who is bigger than 1 lookslike we 're gon na need some help andthat 's where the decimal point comes innow you remember that in the lastsection we learned that 1 could bewritten as one point zero or one pointzero zero or one point zero zero zeroand its value is still warning let 's trydoing that here and see what happensafter the one put a decimal point andthen a zero in the tenths placenow our division problem looks like tendivided by two and that 's easy to do theonly difference is we have a decimalpoint let 's ignore the decimal point fora minute and pretend that our problemreally is ten divided by two so two willgo into 10 five times because five timestwo equals ten and that leaves noremainder so we 're done rightnot so fast we 've got that decimal pointto deal with and we know that five can'tbe the answer because five is biggerthan 1/2we just need to include the decimalpoint in our answer for it to be correctwe put it directly above the decimalpoint in our problem there now ouranswer is 0.5 or 0.5 which is the moreproper way to write it so by dividing wefigured out that the decimal value of1/2 is 0.5 now let 's try converting thefraction 3/4 by dividing of course westart by rewriting our fraction likethis 3/4 and again we run into the sameproblem or is too big to go into 3 so itlooks like we 're gon na need a decimalpointhere too let 's put a decimal point afterthe three and a zero in the tenths placeto make three point zero now our problemalmost looks like 30 divided by four nowif you remember your multiplicationtable you 'll know that four goes intothirty seven times because 7 times 4 is28 30 minus 28 leaves a remainder of 2but we do n't want to remainder so let'skeep going4 is too big to divide into two so theonly way we can get rid of the remainderis to use another zero in the hundredthsplace which makes the number we'redividing up kind of look like 300 now wecan bring down that extra zero to makethe remainder look like 20 and 4 will gointo 20 five times because 5 times 4equals 20 and that leaves no remainderoh yeah do n't forget we need to includethe decimal point in our answer now ifyou 've kept your columns lined up like Ihave you 'll see that the decimal pointgoes right here and that makes ouranswer 0.75 so the decimal value of 3/4is 0.75 all rightlet 's convert one more of the hard waylet 's find the decimal value of 1/3 bydividing 1 by 3 again 3 is too big todivide into 1 so we 'll need to use adecimal point and another 0 which makesour problem look like 10 divided by 3that 's easy 3 goes into 10 three timesbecause 3 times 3 equals 9 and thatleaves a remainder of 1 just like beforewe do n't want a remainder so let 's useanother zero so we can keep on dividingand that gives us 10 divided by 3 againwell we know that 3 goes into 10 threetimes and leaves a remainder of 1 huhstill a remainder of 1 well it lookslike we 're gon na need another zero butthat 's just going to give us 10 dividedby 3 again which is gon na give usanother remainder of 1 this looks likeit might keep on going forever somefractions are like that if you dividethem you 'll see a repeating pattern ofnumbers that continues on forever so thedecimal value of one third is 0.33 3 3 33 3 3 3 and threes that keep on goingforever but since we ca n't keep writingthrees forever we can just stop andround the number off or we can use thisspecial symbol that means this numberrepeats forever all right so all we haveto do to convertfraction into a decimal is divided andso far we 've been doing that the hardway but now we 're gon na do it the easyway we 're gon na use a calculator let'stry a couple with a calculator and seewhat we get to convert one fourth wejust punch in 1/4 and we get 0.25 toconvert 2/3 we just punch in 2/3 and weget 0.2 a whole lot of sixes looks likewe have another one of those repeatingdecimals yep this Way 's certainly easierand quicker too but it 's important toknow how to do it both ways the fivefractions that we 've just converted areso common that it 's a good idea tomemorize their decimal values here theyare again so you can review them onefourth equals 0.25 one third equals 0.33three three three one half equals 0.52/3 equals zero point six six six sixsix and 3/4 equals 0.75 so that 's howyou convert any fraction into a decimalyou just divide and we already learnedhow to go the other way to convert adecimal into a fraction in the lastsection so be sure to review it if youneed to in the next section we 're goingto learn a few tricks that we can use tohelp us compare the values of fractionsbut before that a quick review toconvert any fraction to a decimal numberall you have to do is divide the topnumber by the bottom usually when youdivide a fraction you 'll need to dodecimal division by using the decimalpoint you can keep writing zeros in thedecimal number places and continuedividing until you ask me sometimesdecimal divisions results in a patternthat keeps repeating forever when thathappens you can draw a line over therepeating digits instead of writing themforever once you know how to do decimaldivision I recommend that you convertfractions using a calculator since it'squicker and easier and as always be sureto do the exercises and do n't forget topractice dividing the hard way toobecause if you 're ever stranded on adeserted island without a calculator youneed to be able to dolearn more at math
