one really neat application used find area parallelogram suppose create parallel ground four point b c got parallelogram turns pick vertex parallelogram want pick look vector b use vector form whose value going area b vector b goes point point b component sare going minus minus negative negative negative ad goes point point component going going minus negative minus negative way form vector row matrix determinant negative one thing remember switch determinant change sign determinant possible geta negative answer determinant always take absolute value going write way wrote absolute value vertical would notation determinant know enter vector either order long take absolute value afterwards k let calculate area thats absolute value minus negative times negative let absolute value area parallelogram remember procedure vertex parallelogram vertex share case b use component form determinant calculate determinant take absolute value reversed order vector would gotten negative would absolute value get us area positive make sure remember absolute value absolute value determinant vector area determinant area determinant area determinant area determinant area determinant area determinant area determinant area determinant
