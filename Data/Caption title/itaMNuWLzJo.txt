When we observe the physical world , we find a random fluctuations everywhere.We can generate truly random numbersby measuring random fluctuations known as noise.When we measure this noise , known a sampling , we can obtain numbers.For example , if we measure the electric currentof TV static over time , we will generate a truly randomsequence.We can visualize this random sequenceby drawing a path that changes directionaccording to each number , known as a random walk.Notice the lack of pattern at all scales.At each point in the sequence , the next moveis always unpredictable.Random processes are said to be non-deterministic , since they 're impossible to determine in advance.Machines on the other hand , are deterministic.Their operation predictable and repeatable.In 1946 , John von Neumann was involvedin running computations for the military , specifically involvedin the design of the hydrogen bomb.Using a computer called the ENIAC , he planned to repeatedly calculateapproximations of the processes involved in nuclear fission.However , this required quick access to randomlygenerated numbers that could be repeated if needed.However , the ENIAC had very limited internal memory.Storing long random sequences was not possible.So Neumann developed an algorithmto mechanically simulate the scrambling aspect of randomnessas follows.First , select a truly random number , called the seed.This number comes from the measurement of noise , or the current time in milliseconds.Next , this seed is provided as input to a simple calculation.Multiply this seed by itself.And then output the middle of this result.Then you use this output as the next seedand repeat the process as many times as needed.This is known as the middle-squares method , and is just the first in a long line of pseudo random numbergenerators.The randomness of the sequence isdependent on the randomness of the initial seed only.Same seed , same sequence.So what are the differences between a randomly generatedversus pseudorandomly generated sequence ? Let 's represent each sequence as a random walk.They seem similar until we speed things up.The pseudorandom sequence must eventually repeat.This occurs when the algorithm reachesa seed it has previously used , and the cycle repeats.The lengths , before a pseudorandom sequence repeats , is called the period.The period is strictly limited by the lengthof the initial seed.For example , if we use a two digit seed , then an algorithm can produce at most 100 numbersbefore reusing a seed and repeating the cycle.A three digit seed can expand past 1,000 numbersbefore repeating its cycle.And a four digit seed can expand past 10,000 numbersbefore repeating.Though if we use a seed large enough , the sequence can expand into trillions and trillionsof digits before repeating , though the key differenceis important.When you generate numbers pseudorandomly , there are many sequences , which can not occur.For example , Alice generates a truly random sequenceof 20 shifts.It 's equivalent to a uniform selectionfrom the stack of all possible sequences of shifts.This stack contains 26 to the power20 pages , which is astronomical in size.If we stood at the bottom and shined a light upwards , a person at the top would not seethe light for around 200 million years.Compare this to Alice generating a 20 digit pseudorandomsequence using a four digit random seed.Now this is equivalent to a uniform selectionfrom 10,000 possible initial seeds.Meaning , she can only generate 10,000 different sequences , which is a vanishingly small fractionof all possible sequences.When we move from random to pseudorandom shifts , we shrink the key space into a much , much smaller seed space.So for a pseudorandom sequence to beindistinguishable from a randomly generated sequence , it must be impractical for a computer to try all seedsand look for a match.This leads to an important distinction in computer sciencebetween what is possible , versus whatis possible in a reasonable amount of time.We use the same logic when we buy a bike lock.We know that anybody can simply try all possible combinationsuntil they find a match and it opens.But it would take them days to do so.So for eight hours.We assume it 's practically safe.With pseudorandom generators , the securityincreases as the length of the seed increases.If the most powerful computer would take hundreds of yearsto run through all seeds , then we safelycan assume it 's practically secure , instead of perfectlysecure.As computers get faster , the seed sizemust increase accordingly.Pseudorandomness frees Alice and Bobfrom having to share their entire random shiftsequence in advance.Instead , they share a relatively short random seed , and expand it into the same random looking sequencewhen needed.But what happens if they can nevermeet to share this random seed ? test
