going show different ways find sort different example seven people group population senate sample whatever want work quartile sin set data really helpful couple colors first thing find right thats easiest really knowing good starting point someone remind find open set score got two ways number one sort climb bottom top eventually middle make sense way way yeah conveniently name many going add one chance today hey divide two let label guy right already know thats q median colors want notice look rest data youve got number score median median right put want like oh got whole new set score little set score median make look three mean costa low three whats little corner world two right guy going first quartile rehearse upper set data six middle thats upper quartile lower one upper know whether got right come back quartile remember definition see successful look divided dialogue four equal section done yeah right look data dharma one whats make sense nice neat everything land particularly neatly right another example movie let add score also start found havent actually calculated inter quartile range whats last step thats missy easiest step actually yeah take difference right maybe right hand side wont actually calculate range upper quartile take away lower quartile dont keep writing use abbreviation upper take away lower case see black take away give range way notice right see got could made guy made right making huge outlier range change inter quartile range stay kind like trying avoid u h problem like big deal cool right right let shave look let go try work individual piece right firstly start port fine middle always easiest spot look quick way thats like try practice many turns add one get nine nine divided two four half mean fourth fifth term right going say used red didnt going say right right thats huge soon get rest remember imagine hey look median dot two different going treat one pump three times treat kind population right whats median theyre two three two point five thing yeah six point five thats cube see sometimes quarters land like meeting sometimes doesnt land seven score eightscore id like without holding hand could ninescore ten score well want see steam well share result sin minute go consult third one nine seven point eight going go first looking going go right middle cute easiest spot going turn like whats thought process go find good way um emphasize like see underlie black right important work finding median old example look one theres obvious one look one matter whether say finding whether include five include five leave aside say well four score think answer question would able tell whether include file keep keep thought head let scheme whats young reckon case cool going work whether right apart course look back well call teacher tell yeah fantastic want look spot see successful making sure theres equal arm works doesnt look youve got two score two score two three see get idea right imagine dont dont write going wrong imagine included fire mean youd included fire like already know guy done cute included five score score scheme gon na three right one include five seven right see problem see whats emerge right look oh ill count left see see wan ted look many score see theres one swarm right four see right theres one score youve got two score symmetrical theyre quarters havent divided four equal section thats like always like struggle remember actually learnt learnt random rule dont include texture home saying clicket reason like youve got make sure actually quartile theres four equal section wan na maybe tell last set yeah three thats nice easy see theres odd number fantastic make han g four example theyre need next one old see pattern use pattern first one court allow land four six yeah look one quartile land always theyre theyre look one youve got middle one score outside score youve got score score next one whats going happen one youve got going going back situation see ever one ways know seven store eleven score right youve added fourscore right like slightly see got one two three quartile well one extra one one thats tokay ways youve got quartile draw four video work like know n plus theres go like plus get role think writing much simple yes yes going box whisker going tobe drawing lot tomorrow also forgotten actually calculate inter quartile range one quickly tell whats ratio theres four five spaced also five good box whisker plot going take water school put line quartile put abox around take highest score like thats going spend bit time thats bottom oh way like also cal led five call five number summary summary set score hear phrase sometime tomorrow measure spread find inter quartile range measure spread find inter quartile range measure
