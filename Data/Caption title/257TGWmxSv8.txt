welcome to a lesson on unit conversionsusing American units the United Statescustomary units system also referred toas the American unit system or standardunit system is the most commonly usedsystem of measurement in the UnitedStates the United States is the onlyindustrialized nation that does notmainly use the metric system in itscommercial and standards activitiesalthough the metric system isuniversally used in science andincreasingly in medical government andother sectors of Industry even withinthe United Statesso here the conversions that we 'll beusing will be doing conversions oflength weight as well as capacity inthis lesson and there are two main waysof converting measurement units methodone is by multiplying and dividing wherewe multiply when converting from largerunits to smaller units and we dividewhen converting from smaller units tolarger units we 're not going to be usingthis method in this lesson we 'll beusing method two the method of usingunit fractions so we 're going tomultiply by unit fractions to do ourconversions we 're unit fraction is afraction equal to one each unit fractionwill have different units in thenumerator and denominator formed byusing a known conversion so let 's take alook at our first examplehere were asked to perform the followinglengths conversions we want to convert245 inches and defeat for number one sobecause we 're using unit fractions we'llbegin by writing 45 inches as a fractionwith a denominator of one and now we'regoing to multiply by a unit fraction ora fraction equal to one to convert frominches to feet as long as there is adirect conversion from inches to feet solooking at our table below notice howwe 're told here that one foot is equalto 12 inches so using this conversion wecan form two unit fractions either onefoot over 12 inches or 12 inches overone foot both of those fractions wouldbe equal to one but because we 're tryingto convert inches to feetwe do n't want inches in our answer so wewant inches to simplify out and becausewe have inches in the numerator will putinches in the denominator andfeet in the numerator and again theconversion is 1 foot equals 12 inchesnotice in this form the units of inchessimplifies out because inches divided byinches would simplify to 1 and now wemultiply 45 times 1 is 45 of course 1times 12 is 12 and now we have ourconversion this quotient here will giveus a number of feet in 45 inches soremember a fraction bar means divisionso using the calculator 45 divided by 12is equal to 3.75 so now we know that 45inches is equal to 3 point 7 5 feet ofcourse we could also express this as afraction going back to the calculator ifwe press math enter enter notice how ittells us that 3.75 is equal to 15fourths so it also expresses as 15fourths feet or if we want 15 4 shouldbe equal to 3 and 3/4 feet will go andexpress it as 3.75 feet next we 're askedto convert6 miles to yards so we begin by writing6 miles as a fraction so we have 6 milesover 1 and now we 'll look at ourconversions to see if there 's aconversion from miles to yards noticehow there 's not a direct conversiongiven that goes from miles to yardsnotice how we have 1 mile equals 5,280feet so we can convert miles to feetusing this conversion and then also herewe have 1 yard equals 3 feet so in thiscase what the multiply by two unitfractions to convert miles to yards fromthe given information so we 'll have twounit fractions to convert miles to yardsso let 's first convert miles to feetwe do n't want miles in our answers we'llput miles in the denominator and feet inthe numerator and the conversion is5,280 feet isequal to one mile notice how the unitsof miles would simplify out and now wehave feet we want to convert feet toyards and again because one yard equalsthree feet and we do n't want feet in ouranswerwe 'll put feet in the denominator andyards in the numerator and theconversion is one yard equals three feetnotice how the units of feet simplifiesout so now we multiply we have six times5,280 in the numerator and we have onetimes one times three in the denominatorso our denominator is three and thenumerator is thirty one thousand sixhundred eighty and now we 'll find thisquotient to determine how many yardsthere are in six miles so we havethirty-one thousand six hundred eightydivided by three which gives us tenthousand five hundred sixty and againthis would be the number of yards in sixmilesour last conversion of length we want toconvert 9.6 yards to feet so we 'll write9.6 yards as a fraction we want toconvert yards to feet and remember wehave one yard equals three feet sobecause we want yards to simplify outwe 'll write yard in the denominator andfeet in the numerator and the conversionis three feet equals one yard the unitshave yards simplifies out so notice hereour denominator is one so we need tofind the product of nine point six andthree nine point six times three isequal to 28 point eight so nine pointsix yards equals twenty eight pointeight feet now let 's take a look at someconversions of weight we have six pointthree tonnes equals how many pounds sowe write six point three tonnes as afraction with the denominator of one andthen we take a look at our conversionsto see if there 's a conversion from tonsto pounds and notice how we have aconverthere one ton equals two thousand poundsbecause we do n't want tons in our answerwill write tons in the denominator andpounds in the numerator and theconversion is 1 ton equals two thousandpoundsnotice how the units of tonnessimplifies out so now we multiply so wejust have 6.3 times 2000 which is equalto 12 thousand six hundred so 6.3 tonnesis equal to 12 thousand six hundredpounds next we 're asked to convert 86ounces to pounds so notice how lookingat our conversions we know that onepound is equal to 16 ounces so becausewe 're converting ounces to poundswe do n't want Alice 's in our answer soI 'll write ounces in the denominator andpounds in the numerator and again theconversion is one pound equals sixteenounces notice how Alice 's / ouncessimplifies to one so I 'm multiplying wehave eighty six divided by 16 pounds andnow we 'll find this quotient to know howmany pounds there are in 86 ounces so 86divided by 16 is equal to five pointthree seven five so 86 ounces is equalto five point three seven five poundsnext has to convert six thousandfourteen ounces to tonnes so we write6,400 ounces as a fraction with adenominator of one looking at ourconversions though there 's not a directconversion from ounces to tonnes whichmeans what that multiplied by two unitfractions one where we convert ounces topounds and then we 'll convert pounds totonnes so we want our answer to be intons because we do n't want Alice 's willput ounces in the denominator here andwe 're converting ounces to pounds theconversion is one pound equals 16 ouncesnotice how the units of ounces wouldsimplifyout next we know that one ton is equalto 2,000 pounds because we do n't wantpounds in a ransom we 'll put pounds inthe denominator and tons in thenumerator so that the units of poundswill simplify out the conversion is2,000 pounds equals one ton so now wemultiply the units of pounds simplifiesout now multiplying notice how we havesix thousand four hundred in thenumerator our denominator is 16 times2,000 which would be 32,000 now we findthis quotient to know how many tonnesare in six thousand four hundred ouncesso six thousand four hundred divided by32 thousand this is equal to 0.2 or 0.2of course this is tons so six thousandfourteen ounces is equal to 0.2 tonnesnow let 's take a look at three examplesof converting capacity here s convertthree quarts two cups so we have threequarts as a fraction with a denominatorof one we 're going to convert two cupsso looking at our conversions we'relooking for a conversion that involvesquarts and cups and notice how thereis n't one but we can convert quarts topints and then pints to cups which meanswith the multiplied by two unitfractions to perform this conversion atleast from the given conversions so willfirst convert again quarts to pintswe do n't want quarts in our answer sowe 'll write quarts in the denominator sothey simplify with these quarts in thenumerator we 'll have pints in thenumerator and the conversion again asone quart equals two pints now quartssimplifies out and we have pints but nowwe need to convert pints to cups sowe 'll have pints in the denominator cupsin the numerator the conversion is twocups equals one pint and the units ofpints simplifies out so here we have 3times 2 times 2 all over 1 which wouldjust be 12 which means 3 coreequals 12 cups next rasa converse 72fluid ounces 2 pints so 72 fluid ouncesover 1 we 're converting to pints andagain there 's not one direct conversionfrom fluid ounces to pints at least fromwhat 's given we have eight fluid ouncesequals one cup and then we have one pintequals two cups so again with themultiplied by two unit fractions toperform this conversion so will firstconvert fluid ounces to cups so fluidounces the cups the conversion is eightfluid ounces is equal to one cup so nowthe ounces simplifies out and we havecups but we want pints and we know thatone pint is equal to two cups so we'llwrite cups in the denominator pints inthe numerator and again the conversionis two cups equals one pint somultiplying we have 72 over 8 times 2 is16 this quotient will tell us how manypints are are in 72 fluid ounces sowe 'll go back to the calculator and thisgives us 4 point 5 which means 72 fluidounces is equal to 4 point 5 pints ourlast conversion we want to convert 3.5gallons to fluid ounces notice how Ilove to have several conversions herewill first convert gallons to quarts sogallons in the denominator quarts in thenumerator 4 quarts equals one gallon sonow we have converted gallons to quartsand I will convert quarts to pints thenpines the cups and cups two fluid ouncesactually without our own conversion hereif one cord equals two pints and one piequals two cupsmaybe we can recognize that one quart isequal to four cups so let 's see use ourown conversion one quart equals fourcupsto speed up the process so we 're goingto multiply by a unit fraction wherewe 'll have quarts in the denominatorcups in the numerator and again theconversion we recognized is that 1/4 isequal to 4 cups quarts simplifies outleaving us with cups but again our goalis to have ounces so when we one more ina fraction using the conversion 1 cupequals 8 fluid ounces so I 'm multiplyingby cups in the denominator fluid ouncesin the numerator and again 8 fluidounces is equal to one cup so cupssimplifies out and now we can determinehow many fluid ounces there are in 3.5gallonsnotice how the denominator is 1 so wecan just multiply the numerators so wehave 3.5 times 4 times 4 times 8 whichequals 448 which means our four hundredforty eight fluid ounces in three pointfive gallons okay I hope you found thislesson helpful test
