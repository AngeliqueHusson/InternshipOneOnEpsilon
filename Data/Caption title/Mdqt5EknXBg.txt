hi this is pressure Locker we start thisgame with six empty glasses that areplaced in a row you can number theglasses from one to six starting fromthe left we roll a standard eye andwhatever number we roll we 're going tofill that glass with liquid if we rollanother number we fill that glass withliquid if we roll a number four a glassthat 's already full we 're going to drinkthat glass so that it becomes empty wecontinue playing this game by rollingthe dice and continue filling up glassesor emptying them as necessary at somepoint we might have five glasses thatare full if we roll a number four theempty glass then we 're going to fillthat glass and then we have to drink allsix of the glasses and at this point thegame ends the question for you isstarting from the beginning of the gamewhat is the average number of rollsuntil the game ends give this problem atry and when you 're ready keep watchingthe video for the solution the answer isthat it 's going to take approximatelyeight it 's going to take about eightythree point two rolls for this game toend let 's see why we 're going to startimagining from nearly the end of thegameimagine you have five full glasses howmany rolls an average is it 's going totake for the game to end at this pointwe 're going to write a of X for therolls needed if we already have x fullglasses so if we have five full glasseswe have a of five is going to be givenby a certain equation there are twothings that can happen when we roll thedice there 's a 1/6 chance we 're going toget the number for the empty glass atthis point the game is going to end sothere 's a 1/6 chance that our game isgoing to end in one turn however there'sa 5/6 chance we 're going to roll anumber for one of the glasses that'salready full at this point we 're goingto drink one of the glasses so we end upin a state of the game that has fourfull glassesso in 5/6 of the cases it 's going totake as oneturn to get to the state of having fourfull glasses now how many roses is goingto take when we have four full glasseswe can do a similar equation if we havefour full glasses then there 's a 2/6chance we 're going to roll one of theempty glasses which means it 's going totake as 1 turn to get to the state offive full glasses there will also be afour six chance that we 're going to rolla number for one of the glasses that'sfull so we 're going to drink a glasswhich means we 'll only have three fullglasses so it 's going to take us oneturn to get to the state of three fullglasses well now we have to figure outwhat 's going to happen if we have threefull glasses we can similarly write anequation there 's a three six chancewe 're going to go to the state of havingone four full glasses and there 's alsothree six chance we 're going to go tothe state of having two full glasseswell now we need to figure out whathappens if we have two full glasses andwe can similarly figure out that there'sanother equation that describes it interms of the states of going to threefull glasses or one full glass now we goto the state of having one full glassthere 's going to be a five six chancethat we roll one of the empty glassesand we end up with two full glasses orthere 's a 1/6 chance that we roll one ofthe one glass which is full we drink itand we go to the state of having zerofull glasses the state of having zerofull glasses is what the game is at thevery beginning at this state of coursethere 's a certain chance six out of sixchance we 're going to roll one of theempty glasses so it 's going to take oneturn to get to the state of having onefull glass so now I 'm going to copy overthe equations that we just described inthe following in the previous slides sowe end up with six equations having sixvariables ez row to e5when you have a linear system of nequations and n variables you canactually uniquely solve for all of thesevariables I 'll skip the algebra but youend up with the with the result that theexpected number of rolls when you have 0glasses full when the game is beginningis eighty three point two rolls so ittakes a very very long time for thisgame to endI would not recommend playing this gamewill solve for all the other variablesand you can see that even when you havefive full glasses it 's going to takesixty three more roles for the game toend so although there 's a 1/6 chance soyou 're going to fill that empty glassand just finish the game it 's actuallyvery likely that you 're going to go backand you 're going to end up in thesecycles of going through many glassesthat are full until you end up finallyfilling all the glasses and having thegame end did you figure it out thanksfor watching this video please subscribeto my channel I make videos on math andgame theory you can catch run on my
