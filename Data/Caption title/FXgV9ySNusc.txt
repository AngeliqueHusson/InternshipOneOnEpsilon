video going learn divide polynomial sand sometimes cal led algebraic long division see talking say want divide plus divide really value going express value already know simplify weve done past could divide numerator denominator would equal would equal x plus let write way would equal divide becomes x divide becomes divide get equal x plus pretty straightforward think way could would ill also show algebraic long division bit kill problem want show fundamentally anything new different way thing useful complicated could also written goes plus many would perform way would traditional long division youd say always start highest degree goes highest degree term would ignore goes many goes x times x x place x times like traditional long division subtract plus minus right goes many goes two times positive two constant times subtract remainder might seem kill probably problem already knew going see generalizable process really degree polynomial dividing degree polynomial let show talking let say wan ted divide x plus x squared plus plus look highest degree term x look highest degree term x squared ignore everything else really process say x goes x squared many x squared divided x x right x goes squared x times put x x place right x first power place x times x plus x times x x squared x times x x squared plus x like subtract get x squared plus plus minus x squared let careful minus x squared plus xi want make sure negative sign whole thing x squared minus x squared cancel going minus x let put sign minus x squared minus x clear subtract ing whole minus x bring minus nothing plus look highest degree term x many times x go goes two times x times get times x plus plus going want subtract going subtract instead writing plus could write minus add guy cancel minus many times x go could say thats zero times could say remainder wan ted rewrite x squared plus plus x plus notice thing x squared plus divided x plus thing divided say equal x plus equal x plus plus remainder divided x plus plus x plus right right equivalent wan ted check wan ted go back could multiply x plus x plus add two thing x plus going multiply times x x plus multiplying add x plus common denominator perform addition right multiply two binomial add get x squared plus plus another one theyre kind fun let say want simplify x squared plus plus x plus algebraic long division divide x plus x squared plus plus exact process look highest degree term x goes x squared many goes x x x place right times x x squared x times course going want subtract let put negative sign cancel minus minus plus plus could even see coming could say x plus goes x plus obviously onetime looking constant would completely say well x goes x many one time plus times x times going subtract remainder right equal x plus theres ways could done could tried factor numerator x squared plus plus x plus thing could numerator x plus x plus times plus x plus cancel left x plus way would worked algebraic long division always work even cant cancel like even remainder situation didnt equal x plus another one make sure really actually useful skill let say x squared let change say squared could really make squared minus plus divided actually really interesting show work want go let say third minus squared plus want divide x squared plus made algebraic long division figure going simplified squared plus divided thing third minus squared plus minus look highest degree term x squared goes third many going go times multiply times get third going go times write x term going go times like let times x squared third times squared plus times reim making sure put x place going want subtract cancel minus minus minus plus minus look highest degree term x squared negative squared x squared goes negative negative times negative put constant place negative times x squared negative squared negative times negative going want subtract multiply negative orthose become positive two guy cancel minus let switch colors minus minus negative negative plus equal negative x squared higher degree highest degree view remainder expression could rewrite equal minus thats minus plus minus x squared plus found fun polynomial
