OK , I know some people aren't into green bean casseroles , but I like them.Plus , they remind me of vector fields.Each green bean is like a little arrow , and I just have the urge to line themall up so they flow in the same direction.Maybe a little wavy , representing the vectorsof flow in a river or something.Maybe complete little eddies.Or maybe the beans could represent wind vectors.Long beans would be high-magnitude vectors sayingthere 's a strong wind in that direction , and short , low-magnitude beans would mean low wind speed.You could have a hurricane in your casserole dishwith the long beans of high wind speed flowing counterclockwisenear the center , mellowing out towards the outer edgesof the storm.The center would have the shortest beans of all , showing the calm eye of the storm.Oh , and if you 're wondering why I 'm not curving the beans likethis is because while vector fields might have a shapeor flow to them , the vectors themselves don't.They 're usually shown as straight lines , or numbers , or both.But that 's not because they are straight lines.Vectors just represent what's happening at a single point.It 's like this tiny point and this bit of windcan only travel in one direction at a time , so the bean points in that direction.And that tiny bit of wind has a certain speed , which is represented by the length of the bean.But the bean itself is just notation.Vectors themselves do n't have a shape , just a directionand a magnitude , which means a bean with a directionand magnitude is just as legitimate a vector as an arrowplotted on a graph , or as a set of two numbers , or as one complex number , or as an orange slicecut with a certain angle and thickness , or as shouting a compass directionat a precise decibel level.North.East.I 'll admit I 'm not a huge fan of individual vectors sittingby themselves without meaning or context.One string bean does not make a casserole or matherole , as the case may be.But fields of vectors are awesome.They do have curves and patterns , context , and real-world meaning.There are vectorizable fields permeating this casserole dishright now -- the gravitational field , for instance.Gravitational forces are affectingall of my string beans , pulling them down towards the earth.And so you could use the string beansto create a vector-field casserole that actuallyrepresents the gravitational field they are currently in.Of course , this means just lining up the beansso all point down.And since they 're all affected by basically the same amountof gravity , they should all be the same length.If you are cooking at a high altitude , be sure to cut your string beans shorterby an negligible amount.Another favorite vectorizable field of mineis also currently permeating these string beans -- the electromagnetic field.And if I had a giant bar magnet as a coaster-trivet thing , maybe I 'd want my casserole to show the magnetic field thatis actually there.The points near the poles of the magnetwould have larger vectors , and they 'd curve aroundjust like iron filings do when you put themin a magnetic field.And the beans would show how the force weakensas it gets further from the magnetand goes from north to south.Or if you want to be true to life and do n't have a magnet , you could put equal-sized string beansall pointing the same way , and thenmake sure your casserole is always pointing north , whichmight make it difficult to pass around the table , but I think dish-passing simplicity can be sacrificedfor the sake of science , or mathematics , whatever this is.Speaking of which , you can also invent your own vector fieldby making up a rule for what the vector will be at each point.Like if you just said for any pointyou choose , you 'll take the coordinates x comma y , and give that point a vector that 's y comma x , sothat this point , 0 , 5 , has the vector 5 , 0.And at negative 3 , negative 1 , you have negative 1 , negative 3.And negative 4 , 4 gets 4 and negative 4.It 's so simple.But you get this awesome vector fieldwhere the vectors kind of whoosh in from the corners and crashand whoosh out.Anyway , there 's lots of other stuff you can do , but I 'm going to go ahead and pour some goopy stuff into hereand get this thing casserole-ing.It may not look very inspiring yet , but it 's far from done.The most essential part of a matheroleis an awesome oniony topping , and I 've got just the trick.I will even show it to you in the next video . test
