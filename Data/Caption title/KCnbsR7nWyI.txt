when can we say that a polygon isinscribed in a circle if we have apolygon like this with all its verticeson the boundary of the circle we can saythat it is inscribed in the circle butin this figure we can also say that thecircle passes through all the verticesof the polygon in technical terms we saythat the circle is circumscribed aboutthe polygon now let 's reverse thescenario we have a polygon and a circleinside it which touches each side atexactly one point here we say that thepolygon is circumscribed above thecircle and the circle is inscribed inthe polygon so now we know whatcircumscribed and inscribed means inthis session we will understand a fewproperties of a polygon inscribed in acircle so on a new page we draw a circlewith a polygon inscribed within it let'scall the polygon ABCD this polygon isactually a quadrilateral and aquadrilateral inscribed in a circle iscalled a cyclic quadrilateral the mostimportant property of a cyclicquadrilateralis that its opposite angles always addup to 180 degrees so in this figureangle A plus angle C will be 180 degreesan angle B plus angle D will also be 180degrees no matter how the quadrilateralis placed or formed as long as it isinscribed in a circle this will alwayshold true another important property isabout its exterior angle if we extendany side further we get an exteriorangle and this angle will always beequal to its interior opposite angleangle BC E is the exterior angle and itwill be equal to angle da be as it isits interior opposite angle this anglewill equalSanga let 's try solving an example basedon these two concepts we are given thatquadrilateral ABCD is cyclicit means points a b c and d lie on theboundary of the circle with that we aregiven the measure of angle ADC and theexterior angle BCE we have been asked tofind the measure of angle P go on giveit a shot we need to find angle P and wehave been given these two angles nowsomehow if we manage to get the measureof these two angles we can easily get toangle P so how will we do thatif we look at triangle PB C this will bethe only angle which is unknown andusing the sum of angles of a triangleproperty we should be able to find iteasily but how do we get the measures ofthese two angles is the question let'sgo step by step we note that theexterior angle of a cyclic quadrilateralis equal to its interior opposite angleso angle BC e will be equal to angle dabe a hundred and ten degrees this angleis 110 degrees getting these two anglesis easy provided we know one simpleconcept the sum of opposite angles of acyclic quadrilateral is always 180degrees angle ADC and angle ABC will addup to 180 degrees an angle ADC is 100degrees angle ABC will measure 80degrees this will be 80 degreessimilarly angle BCD will measure 70degrees this angle will be 70 degreesnow all we need to do is look attriangle P BC as the sum of angles in atriangle is 1180 degrees we get angle P plus 80degrees plus 70 degrees equal to 180degrees and solving this gives us themeasure of angle P as 30 degreesyou test
