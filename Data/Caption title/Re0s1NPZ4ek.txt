in this math talk we 're going tointroduce some formulas for what we callanalytic geometry now analytic geometryis a little bit different from the grade9 Euclidean geometry that we studied forplane figures like triangles andtrapezoids and parallelograms where weused Euclid 's postulates basically toprove things for example proving thatfor example opposite sides of aparallelogram are equal we are going tochange the way we do this by taking ourgeometry and putting it on the Cartesianplane so we begin by taking the XY planeand we place two points P and Q on thatXY plane the coordinates of those pointsare x1 y1 and x2 y2 and we connect aline segment between them now justreading down to the axes we can see thatpoint P has this x coordinate x1 andpoint Q has this x coordinate x2 and werecognize that the distance betweenthese two points and when I say thedistance between these two points arethese two x-values I 'm referring to thehorizontal distance can be expressed asx2 subtract X 1 we now do the same thingfor the y coordinaterecognizing that point P has ay-coordinate of y1 and point Q has ay-coordinate of y2 and the verticaldistance between those two points is y2subtract Y 1 and now we become veryinterested in this right triangle thatI 've marked in yellow connecting the twopoints P and Q what we need to recognizeis really we have three sides to thistriangle we have the side PQ whichrepresents the hypotenuse we have theside the vertical side which is why tosubtract y1 and we have the horizontalside which is x2 subtract x1 well veryquickly we get our old formula that wedeveloped when I say old we developed itback in grade 8 or grade 9 that relatedthe slope or the gradient the steepnessof the line segment PQ to thecoordinates and we base it on theconcept that slope is rise over runcomparehow much you travel up and down versushow much you travel horizontally as youmove from point P to point Q and so wesay slope PQ is rise divided by run wellsubstituting for the sides that we havemarked in blue and red the rise is y2minus y1 and the Run is x2 subtract x1and so we have the slope of PQ which wecall em em PQ is y2 minus y1 over x2minus x1 pretty straightforward stuffthat we 've worked on before now thesecond formula I 'd like to develop isthe distance the distance or the lengthof the line segment connecting P to Qthe distance from P to Q effectivelywell when I look at that diagram Irecognize that it is a right triangleand I understand that in right triangleswe have something called the Pythagoreantheorem and the Pythagorean theoremstates that the square of the hypotenuseis equal to the sum of the squares ofthe other two sides so if I were toexpress that for the diagram that wehave here we see that the length of PQsquared would be equal to the runnsquared plus the rise squared well wecan then substitute for the run and therise and take a square root and weunderstand that the length of PQ is thesquare root of x2 minus x1all squared plus y2 minus y1 all squaredand that 's our second formula the thirdone that we like to come up with whichis very useful when we talk aboutcertain characteristics of triangles isthe midpoint formula and let me just adda bit of a construction here I placed apoint midway between P and Q and for nowI 'll mark that point M now if you wereto take a look at the x-coordinate andthe y-coordinate for that point youmight be able to reason out that thex-coordinate lies halfway between x1 andx2 if point M lies halfway between P andQ I think that makes intuitive sense tomost people so the question is how do wefind the halfway point between x1 and x2well that 's really just simply theaverage of x1 and x2 and what I 'm sayinghere is that we take X 1 plus X 2 anddivide by 2 and that would give us thex-coordinate of M similarly we would dothe same thing for the y-coordinate sowe 'd have Y 2 plus y 1 all over 2 and sowe have a formula for the midpoint whichis X 2 plus X 1 and we could havewritten that in either order X 1 plus X2 or X 2 plus X 1 over 2 and Y 2 plus y1 over 2 and those are the three keyformulas that we 're going to use toanswer a lot of our problems in analyticgeometry let me go a little bit furtherand develop equations of lines so now Iwill draw the line that passes throughpoints P and Q and I 'm going to pick anarbitrary point a which I will call X Ythat could be any point that red pointcould be any point on this line passingthrough PQ what I would like to do isfind the equation of that line passingthrough P and Q and there are a varietyof ways to do it but I 'm going to do itthis way just because it 's a little bitdifferent not all teachers will teach itthis way I just want to show it to youthis way I think you would agree that nomatter where I place point a thefollowing would have to be true theslope of the line segment that joins ato P so MP a has to be the same slope asa 2 Q the line segment joining a and Qif they all all three points lie on astraight line or they are what we callcollinear well that being said if Isubstitute for the slope of PA and theslope of aq I get the followingexpression that X 2 minus x over Y 2minus y is equal to X minus X 1 over Yminus y 1 now the next step involves alittle bit of algebra but it 's not toobad I 'm going to cross multiply thesetwo ratios that I have and that willlook something like this I 'll multiply X2 minus X 1 times y minus y 1 and saythat that has to be equal to X subtractone times why to subtract why now if Iexpand by just using the distributiveproperty or what we often call withbinomials foil I get the expression onthe left and the expression on the rightand I would encourage you possibly topause the video and verify that you getexactly those two expressions from thatpoint I simplify by recognizing I have anegative XY on both sides of theequation so that will disappear andthat 's kind of handy actually and then Igather on one side of the equation allof the red y 's that 's the variable pointY and on the other side of the equationall of my red X 's in other words the xcoordinate of point a and all of theleftover stuff the x2 y1 the minus x1 y2and now I 'm going to do a little bit ofcommon factoring and so we get on theleft hand side y times x2 minus x1equals on the right hand side y2 minusy1 X plus x2 y1 minus x1 y2 now what'skind of interesting is that x2 minus x1looks very familiarand the y2 minus y1 looks very familiarnext what I 'm going to do is divide bothsides by the x2 subtract x one on theLeft we just have Y and on the right wehave the expression that you see butwhat you notice in front of X the redvariable X what you notice is you have Yto subtract y1 over x2 subtract x1well that in fact was our slope so thatcan be replaced just with M and then thesecond part of that expression justinvolves the x1 and x2 the y1 and the Y2 that is just a calculation that youneed to perform to get a single valuethat will come out to a value that wewill arbitrarily call B now that form isvery familiar to us we remember lastyear learning abouty equals MX plus B or the year beforeyou learned about y equals MX plus Bwe 're calling that the M represented theslope of the line through P and Q theslope of that line and B ended up beingthe y-intercept and so all of thatalgebra really reduces to y equals MXplus B so the good news is we now have afourth formula that we 're going to usefor doing our problems but I want toshow you one other thing that we couldhave done with that last development wecould have taken the expression that wehad with the X and the y factored outI 've reversed the left and right handside and I could have gatheredeverything to one side of the equationso I would have had an expressionlooking like this now once again youmight want to perform this on your ownto verify that the first line leads tothe second line now I told you that y2minus y1 and x2 minus x1 certainlylooked familiar and they do they reallyrepresent the rise and the run so reallywhat I have is rise X minus run y plusand that x2 y1 minus x1 y2 is just goingto be some constant it 's just acalculation that I 'm doing with the xand y-coordinates and so I get thissimple sort of expression where I havethe rise times X minus the run times yplus C has to be 0 this is another formof the equation of this linenow one other manipulation that I willdo will be this I will turn it into riseX plus negative run y plus C equals 0I 'm going to call the rise arbitrarily athe negative run arbitrarily B and leavethe C as it is and I get ax plus bu yplus C equals 0 and that in fact is whatwe call the standard form for theequation of a line so buried in thatstandard form is rise and run the a isthe rise and the B is the negative ofthe run and that can be kind of handywhen you 're looking at the standard formfor the equation of a line you can pickthat right out and so we have ourstandard form we have our y equals MXplus B form and we havethat 's called point-slope form and I'llget to that more when we do somequestions and that 's coming up next butI 'm probably running over time at thispoint and so I 'll put my examples in thenext video thanks for watching see yousoon mathtalk- analytic geometry intro mathtalk- analytic geometry intro mathtalk- analytic geometry intro
