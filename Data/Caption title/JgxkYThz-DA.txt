okay in this video we 're going to belooking at the extrema of functions wellwhat our extrema well the extreme arereferring to the maximum and minimumvalues the maximum value of the functionis the largest value in its range andthe minimum value is going to be of afunction is the smallest value in itsrange and again these are what we callthe extreme values of the extrema of thefunction now sometimes there is nomaximum or minimum values instead weneed to look at what we call relativeextrema what that means is that thoseare situations where we restrict when werestrict the domain then we may haveother relative minimum or relativemaximum values which we 'll look at herelet 's look at some of these examples inthis first example it says that or welook at the graph and we do if we wereto ask to find the maximum or minimumvalues there would be none because thisgraph as we look at it it goesinfinitely up and it goes infinitelydown so there is no maximum value andthere 's no minimum value because itkeeps going up and down now I couldrestrict the domain maybe i restrict thedomain to just be this section here inwhich case if I restrict the domainthere I would have a relative minimumvalue or maybe I restrict the domain togo to be in just this piece here thissection well if that 's the case then Ido have a relative maximum at B let'slook at the next examplethe next example goes infinitely up onone end it goes infinitely up on theother end well that means that in thiscase I do have a minimum value in thiscase my minimum value is going to be Cbecause that is the lowest point in ourrange there and again it does not have amaximum value because it goes infinitelyup now I could restrict the domain togive us other relative maximum andminimum values for example I couldrestrict the domain to be just thissection so I would have that relativeminimum would be C I could restrict thedomain to bethis section here in which case I wouldhave a relative minimum at E or I couldrestrict the domain to give me arelative minimum at G i could alsorestrict the domain to get relativemaximum values for this one i couldrestrict the domain between there to bein that section in which case i 'd have arelative maximum at d and i couldrestrict it in this section here to giveme a relative maximum value of f sothat 's a situation where we have aminimum value but no maximum well wecould have other situations where wehave no minimum but we have maximumvalues like this next one because nextone it goes infinitely down in bothdirectionsso there is no minimum value but we cansee that there is a maximum value at hwe could also say that it 's a relativemaximum value at h because we couldrestrict the domain and it 's also referto that as a relative maximum but thisone has no relative minimum like there'sno spot that I could restrict the domainwhere I would have a dip in that graphor I would have a vertex I might saywell we could restrict the domain likethis and then if I did would n't thispoint here be the relative minimum nobecause that 's just a point on the graphit is not a vertex is n't the way thatyou need to look at it once again slashexample this last example is uniquebecause as we can see here that it goesinfinitely up and infinitely down sothere 's no minimum or maximum values andthere 's no way for me to restrict thedomain to meeting for me to get arelative minimum or relative maximumvalue so this one 's unique because thishas known not only does it have nomaximum or minimum values but also hasno relative maximum or minimum valueseither let 's look at some other examplesokay let 's look at this first example soit 's considered a graph of the functionwhere we have X cubed minus 5x minus 2shown at the right they tell us that arelative maximum occurs when X isapproximately negative 1.3 and arelative minimum occurs when X isapproximately 1.3 we want to ascribe theintervals when f is increasing now onething that 's important to knowthat we read a graph from left to rightso they look at this graph from left toright we 're asked us figure out when isthis graph increasing well it'sincreasing as we get closer to thisnegative 1.3 but after we hit where X isnegative 1.3 it decreases once we get towhere X is 1.3 it goes back toincreasing again so here 's how we candescribe where it 's increasing itsincreasing when X is less than negativeone point three so that interval when Xis negative one point three itsincreasing as we look at it from left toright and it 's also increasing when X isgreater than one point three that 's whatthat should read well now let 's look atwhere F is decreasing F is decreasinggoing from in this segment here aregoing from when X is negative one pointthree so when X is a positive one pointthree so the way that we would writethat is you would say that our valuesfor X between negative one point threeand one point three by usinginequalities let 's look at this otherexample together it says consider thegraph of this function where we havenegative two thirds X to the 4/3 X cubedminus five X at the right the xcoordinates of key points are labeledwith letters we want to figure out usingletters you are using the letter labelsand what intervals is H negative wellthat 's referring to 1 as our answergoing to be negative and if I look atthe graph the areas where a graph isnegative are these sections here sothese are the intervals where the H'sare going to be negative or when ourvalue is going to be negative so the waywe can describe that using letter labelsand inequalities is we could say thatwhen X is less than this a value our ouranswer our value is going to be negativewhen our going from when X is C and whenX is e so when X is between those twopoints when X is between C and E ourvalues are negative and when X is biggerthan this value G our answer is alsogoing to be negative so we woulddescribe that like this we would saythat X is going to be less than awe 're gon na say that X is between C andE and that when X is greater than G andall those intervals is when our valuefor H is going to be negative now itsays using the letter labels in whichinterval is H positive well that 's goingto be in these two sections well inthese two sections this is we candescribe this by saying that our valuesfor X are going to go from A to Cbecause between a and C between thosetwo points our values are positive andbetween the points E and G our valuesare also positive so we 'd say that X isgonna be between E and G so that 's howwe can describe that using inequalitiesnow that 's where you 're actually goingto end this video looking at the maximumand minimum values and looking at somehow to identify intervals of a graph andthe next section of this video or thenext part of the video that you 'll bewatching you 're going to be looking atthis you 're going to be looking at howto find the zeros of a function and whatthe zeros are so with that we 'll stopthis video so go ahead and watch thatnext video so you can learn about how tofind these zeros of a polynomial test
