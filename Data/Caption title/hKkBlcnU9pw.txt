Let 's do some examples comparing absolute values.So let 's say we were to ask ourselveshow the absolute value of negative 9 , I should say , how that compares to the absolute value of -- letme think of a good number -- let 's saythe absolute value of negative 7.So let 's think about this a little bit , and let 's think about what negative 9 looks like , or where it is on the number line , where negative 7is on the number line.Let 's look at what the absolute values mean , and then we should probably be able to do this comparison.So there 's a couple of ways to think about it.One is you could draw them on the number line.So if this is 0 , if this is negative 7 , and thenthis is negative 9 right over here.Now , when you take the absolute value of a number , you 're really saying how far is that number from 0 , whether it 's to the left or to the right of 0.So , for example , negative 9 is 9 to the left of 0.So the absolute value of negative 9 is exactly 9.This evaluates to 9 , Negative 7 is exactly 7 to the left of 0.So the absolute value of negative 7 is positive 7.And so if you were to compare 9 and 7 , this is a little bit more straightforward.9 is clearly greater than 7.And if you ever get confused with the greater than or lessthan symbols , just remember that the symbolis larger on the left-hand side.So that 's the greater than side.If I were to write this -- and thisis actually also a true statement.If you took these without the absolute value signs , it is also true that negative 9 is less than negative 7.Notice the smaller side is on the smaller number.And so that 's the interesting thing.Negative 9 is less than negative 7 , but their absolute value , since negative 9is further to the left of 0 , it is -- the absolute valueof negative 9 , which is 9 , is greaterthan the absolute value of negative 7.Another way to think about it is if you take the absolute valueof a number , it's really just goingto be the positive version of that number.So if you took the absolute value of 9 , that equals 9.Or the absolute value of negative 9 , that is also equal to 9.Well , when you think of it visually , that 's because both of these numbersare exactly 9 away from 0.This is 9 to the right of 0 , and this is 9 to the left of 0.Let 's do a few more of these.So let 's say that we wanted to compare the absolute value of 2to the absolute value of 3.Well , the absolute value of a positive numberis just going to be that same value.2 is two to the right of 0 , so this is justgoing to evaluate to 2.And then the absolute value of 3 , that 's just going to evaluate to 3.It 's actually pretty straightforward.So 2 is clearly the smaller number here.And so we clearly get 2 is less than 3 , or the absolute value of 2 is less than 3.So we have a less than right over here.Let 's say you wanted to compare -- I 'm trying to find a suitable color -- the absolute valueof negative 8 to the absolute value of 8.Well , one way to think about is that they'reboth 8 away from 0.This 8 to the left of 0.This is 8 to the right of 0.So both of these things evaluate to 8.Absolute value of negative 8 is 8.Absolute value of 8 is 8.And so , clearly , 8 is equal to 8.Let me do a couple more examples.Let 's say I wanted to compare the absolute valueof negative 1 , and I want to compare that to positive 2.So the absolute value of negative 1is just the positive version of 1 , or it 's just the positive version of negative 1 , which is just 1.So 1 is clearly less than 2.Or the other way to think about it , the absolute valueof negative 1 is clearly less than 2 .
