We 're asked to shade 20 % of the square below.Before doing that , let's just even think aboutwhat percent means.Let me just rewrite it.20 % is equal to -- I 'm just writing it out as a word -- 20percent , which literally means 20 per cent.And if you 're familiar with the word century , you mightalready know that cent comes from the Latinfor the word hundred.This literally means you can take cent , and thatliterally means 100.So this is the same thing as 20 per 100.If you want to shade 20 % , that means , if you break up thesquare into 100 pieces , we want to shade 20 of them.20 per 100.So how many squares have they drawn here ? So if we go horizontally right here , we have one , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight , nine , ten squares.If we go vertically , we have one , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight , nine , ten.So this is a 10 by 10 square.So it has 100 squares here.Another way to say it is that this larger square -- I guessthat 's the square that they're talking about.This larger square is a broken up into 100 smaller squares , so it 's already broken up into the 100.So if we want to shade 20 % of that , we need to shade 20 ofevery 100 squares that it is broken into.So with this , we 'll just literally shade in 20 squares.So let me just do one.So if I just do one square , just like that , I have justshaded 1 per 100 of the squares.100 out of 100 would be the whole.I 've shaded one of them.That one square by itself would be 1 % of the entire square.If I were to shade another one , if I were to shade thatand that , then those two combined , that 's 2 % of theentire square.It 's literally 2 per 100 , where 100 wouldbe the entire square.If we wanted to do 20 , we do one , two , three , four -- if weshade this entire row , that will be 10 % , right ? One , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight , nine , ten.And we want to do 20 , so that'll be one more row.So I can shade in this whole other row right here.And then I would have shaded in 20 of the 100 squares.Or another way of thinking about it , if you take thislarger square , divide it into 100 equal pieces , I 've shadedin 20 per 100 , or 20 % , of the entire larger square.Hopefully , that makes sense .
