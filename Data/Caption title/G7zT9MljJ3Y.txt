So a cube has perfect symmetry , right ? You know what I mean . Every face is the same.And a tetrahedron has perfect symmetry . Okay , there are four faces , and they 're all the same.You can ask , and Euclid did , what are all of the symmetricthree-dimensional objects ? And it turns out there are only five of them . Most people know what a cube is , and a tetrahedron.But there are also an octahedron , which has eight faces , you know , four on top and four on the bottom . And it 's again , perfectlysymmetrical . Every way you twist and turn it , it looks the same , just like a cube . And then there are two others.There 's the icosahedron and the dodecahedron.But that 's it . So first you might think , well , if there are so many funny ones , why are n't there lots of different ones ? So I proved that in class , I mean , it 's a real theorem , and I said , therefore , there are only five fair dice.Because each of those dice would be fair , that is , if I wanted to generate a number between one and eight , if I rolled theoctahedron , each of these faces is equally likely to come out . Somehow , intuitively , we know that . You know , that 's a fair dicewhich has eight sides . And a kid raises his hand in class and said , I have a thirty sided die.And I said , no you don't.And he said , yeah I do.When you first meet it , it 's just some lumpy roundish thing . But in fact , it 's called a rhombic triacontahedron , and it has thirty faces , and all of the faces are the same size.They 're all little rhombuses.That 's why it 's called a rhombic thing . Now , this die is n't assymmetric as the other ones . This vertex has five faces that meet at this vertex.But this vertex has three faces that meet at this vertex.So it 's not as symmetrical , for example , a cube has three faces at each vertex , you know , and every edge has two sides . And so there 's a question , is it fair , and what does that mean ? Well , of course we know what it means in practice . We mean if we throw ityou know , it should land on each of the thirty faces a thirtieth of the time.But let me talk about that for a second . When I was a graduate student , we had a guy who was a retired executivewho wanted to test the laws of chance . And he came into the department , and he said , I like throwing dice when I watch television . And actually , Brady , it might be that some of your viewers might want to participate in this . And in the end , he wound up rolling a diethree and a half million times , and recording how many times did each face come out . And here are some things you learn . The first thing is thatdice , if you roll them a lot , get round . Of course they do . If you roll a die20,000 times it , you know , bounces around , it changes . So we had to give him new dice . The notion of long-term frequency , it 's actually pretty fictional . The second thing was , dice the way they 're made , the dicehe was using , have pips drilled in them and filled with paint . So there 's a six has six spots in it.Well , those drill holes are lighter.So the six face actually has less mass , and the one face , which is opposite , has more.You know , they were n't fair.Now , casino dice are much more carefully made . The holes are filled with paint of the same specific gravity as thesurrounding material , so they really are pretty close to fair . When you start thinking about anything , even something as silly as , as , what does it mean to say a dice , die is fair , there are things to think about , of course.Okay , so I wanted to think about , what does it meanto say this die is fair ? There 's the notion of the symmetry group of a die . A symmetry of an object , any object , is the set of alltransformations I can make , like turning it a quarter , orturning it this way , or turning it over , which bring it , atom for atom , where it was , okay ? So that 's called a symmetry group . And of course , if I have one symmetry , like turning at a quarter turn , I can do it twice.I can go once , twice , right ? So I can combine the symmetry of flip that way with the symmetry of a flip that way.So , we say that the symmetries of an object form a group . All that means is , you cantake one symmetry , and then take another symmetry , and compose them , do them twice . You have to be able to undo it.If I just did thisI can undo it.Brady : `` What 's a , what 's a function you could perform on a dice , for example , that you could n't undo just by doing it backwards ? `` Suppose that the die was made out of Jell-O and I flattened it.I could n't undo that , probably . That would n't be a symmetry.Brady : `` Okay . That is the definition . `` Right , right . Exactly , exactly.Takes it atom for atom to where it is , and , and , you know , of course you can reverse it . Different objects have differentnotions of symmetry . So this tetrahedron , it has less symmetry , somehow . The number of different things I can do to it , it 's less than what I can do to this . There are twelvesymmetries that I can make of this if you start fiddling , and there twenty-four symmetries that I can make with this die . And obviously some giant thing like this , you know , there are a lot of different things I could do to it.Joe Keller and I defined an object to be fair by symmetry if its group of transformationswas transitive on the faces . And all that means is , I can take the dieand leave it atom for atom the same , but have any face where this face is.You know , right now , the two is up in the rhombus.Well , I should be able to make the ten come up by a symmetry , and have the diejust exactly where it was , but have the ten up . We define the die to be fair by symmetry if its symmetriesact transitively on the faces , meaning I can take any face to any other face . This die , its symmetry group isn'ttransitive on the vertices . I ca n't take this vertex , which has five things around , it into this vertex , which has three things around it . I could move this vertex to there , but the surrounding territory will be different . We did prove that this die has atransitive symmetry group.Brady : `` But not by vertex , but yes by face . `` Yes by face . And not by edges , either , actually . So we did show that this die has a transitive symmetry group.Brady : `` That 's fair . `` So it 's fair . It sounds fair now . If every face is the same , and since the bets are gon na be on the faces , it sounds fair.Then we had the idea , what are all the fair dice ? Euclid found thecompletely fair dice . That is , Euclid 's Theorem iswhat are all theobjects whose groups are transitive on their faces , on their edges and on their vertices ? And the cube , of course , you could see , every vertexlooks the same , right ? And similarly , every edge looks the same . Not , not this guy.And with Joe , we classified all of the fair dice.Suppose I had a five-gon.And then let 's put a point up here and down here , andconnect that point . Fill in the solid so it 's got five edges.And then it 'll have five triangles going up , and five triangles going down.That 's a fair object , because these fivetriangles all are the same , and they 're obviously the same as these five triangles , and so every triangle is the same . But I could put that point wherever I want , and you 'd get very different looking dice , right ? You 'd get a kind of little tiny thing or a very long thing.But , so that 's a one parameter family of ten-sided dice . What we found is that there are thirty families of fair dice.We classified them , and then we found out that Archimedes had been there before us , abouttwenty-five hundred years ago.Brady : `` How many members does each family have ? Or is it infinite ? `` Infinite , infinite , because there 's a continuous parameter.But , it 's interesting that there were , you know , two continuous parameters.We have a list . Some of the things on the list do n't have a parameter in them . Some of them do.We found all the possible fair dice.Brady : `` You told me you could do that with a pentagon , and I follow , that made sense , '' and I could imagine you could do that with a hexagon and a seven-gon , '' why could n't you do it with a 200,000-gon ? `` It , it , it 's true.Now , it 's true what you say , and you 've caught me , Brady , because that , exactly , that 's exactly correct . So why is n't that infinitely many , um , infinitely many fair dice ? It is . And so , let me amend the statement of my theorem.That 's an infinite family . That is an infinite family.And it has what we callDihedral symmetry , that is , the only symmetry that those dice have is , these sides are all the same , and these sides are all the same , and these sides are all the same as these sides , okay ? So dice with more than dihedral symmetry , that is we call them interesting dice . They have extra symmetry.Brady : `` So the example I just gave is trivial to you almost . `` Well , it 's an important example . If I took this tetrahedron , and if I had another one , and I stuck them together , that would be a triangle , a point above and a point below , right ? So here it is . I made one.And obviously , you know , this is a six-sided thing.Here , here are three sides , here are the other three sides . These three are all the same , these three are all the same.So this is a fair thing . Now , if you flipped it , of course you 'd have to roll it , and you 'd have to talk about theside that lands down . Here 's another six-sided die . Is there any sense in which we can say that this die ismore or less fair than this die ? That 's a philosophical question , it 's a math question.The symmetry group of this die , there are just six symmetries , you can twist it aroundthree things , or you could turn it over and twist it around three things . The size of the symmetry group is as small as it could be.Whereas this die has twenty-four symmetries . What does that mean ? I know , I once did a numberphile video about flipping a coin , so I got a friend with a stopwatch , and I went one two three flip ! one two three flip ! and when we were talking about that , we said , well of course , physics should come into thisdescription of fairness someplace . Of course it should come in with dice , and it 's the samephysics . It 's mechanics . If I roll the die very carefully , so it just goes around these four faces , on a blanket.Well , that 's not very fair , because these faces could not come up.When you release the die from your hand , if you 're actually rolling it , it hasvelocity , and it has angularvelocities , and there 's a phase space.What direction is it going in , and how fast , and then how fast is it turning in each of various directions ? And there are actually twelve dimensions of parameters needed to describe the initial conditions . What we can show , is that , that twelve-dimensional space of initial conditions is partitioned up into six regions , regions where , if the die leaves your hand when the initialpositions are in this part of the phase space , it comes up at side one . All of the initial conditions where the die comes up at side two . It can only come up in oneof six faces . So that partitions the , this twelve-dimensional space intoregions , six different regions . The partitioning up of phase space is much finer for this diethan for this die . This partitioning is cruder . For any way of rolling , small changes in the initial conditions , the differencebetween your hand and your brain , make for a big difference in what side it comes up , because thepartitioning of the phase space is finer.So there is a sense in which symmetry is n't the only determining factor , physics and symmetry combine to allow areasonably satisfactory analysis of just how fair dice are.Brady : `` So the cube is fairer . `` The cube is fairer.Tiny little changes in just how you release it will make for the difference between side one and side two , whereas the basins of attraction for side , you know , one up to six , with thistwo tetrahedral die , are cruder . And so , it would be easier to control , for example . You know a coin is thesimplest kind of dice , the simplest kind of die , it just has two faces , right ? Obviously , heads and tails are symmetric , but of course when you really flip a coin , you know , the flips matter.And I once had a colleague who was at a junior high school , and he called up and said , I gave my kidsthe problem of flipping a coin , and when they flipped coins , it was very very patterned.You know , head tail head tail head tail head tail.And he could n't understand it . And I went in and watched the kids flip , and they were bored out of their minds , and they werejust doing wimpy little flips.You know , so that it would flip once . Now of course it 's going to come up head tail head tail.So , you know , how you flip can make a difference.How you roll a die can make a difference.This is n't the end . In fact , our next video will be the second part of thisinterview with Professor Diaconis , talking more about fair dice and casino dice .
