okay let 's go back and revisit divisionhere 's a division problem in a ten-milemachine to 36 divided by 12 is 23 12looks like 1 dot X 2 2 dots we foundlots of 1 dots next to two dots in thepicture of 236 that we sort through thetens level at 3 at the ones level 23 allright grantbut that 's us humans loving ten onemachine so much well I want to do now isrepeat this idea in all machines all atonce which is crazy all right here goesso what I mean by that so I 'll play thesame game now they 'll go do it themachine but we 're not tell you whichmachine were in so the move them in Imight be thinking of a 10-1 machine Iwas like Tilly maybe it 's a to onemachine or three one machine you won'tknow because I 'm not telling you themood I 'm in but you will have a machinewhich is grant or fill his asad machineand well what machine is it well you doknow that dots here always worse onebecause I 've always set the game up thatway and the thing is you do n't have 10dots exploits become one or two dotsexplodes become one you get a wattnumber machine ten one two one who knowsnow just to give a nod to algebra inhigh school curriculum if there 's acertain thing you do n't know anymore torepresent with a letter what 's thefavorite letter of the alphabet for anunknown well turns out to be X it won'tcease to be assessed with an X for anunknown so all followed suit we callthis an x one machine x dots explodesbecome one dot one place the left youjust do n't know what X tends to be maybeit 's 10 not telling you maybe it 's twoyou do n't know because I 'm not tellingyou it 's in my headI 'm just not telling you ha all rightbut you do know dots you 're always worth1 but you now know X are these dots Xonesmakes one of these guys so it 's mostlyworth x1 and x2 these X X 's that'smultiplication x-axis makes one of thosethis what 's your worth xx 's as you callit x squared and x2 these X X Squared'smakes the next 1 over X cubed and Xcubed makes one of those X to the fourthand so on all right just as a check if Ido reveal to you that X really is 10 inmy head then do we really have thecorrect thing for 10 one machine ten onewell let 's see you 'll get the numbers 1if X is 10 I get 10 10 squares 110 cubesor thousand I get one ten hundredthousand is thatthat is correct for ten my machine whichis another checksuppose I said to you actually noteinstead X really was two in my brain allalong is this correct for two onemachine 1 2 is grade 4 8 16 yes this isin fact correct for to a machine so insome sense this does represent allmachines all at once there it is itcould be a 10-9 machine which case gotgreat numbers there could be two amachine which scheduled have the correctnumbers there and so on ground now outof the blue I know we 've been doinggrade school with it all this time I'mgoing to take us straight to advancedhigh school algebra right now because Iwant us on this very spot right now todo this thing 2x squared 4 7 x / 6 /exercise - whoa now this fancy languagefor this in high school eligible theycall this polynomial division orsomething but well what am I reallydoing I 'm not gon na worry about thelanguage I got something like this to bedivided by something like that andobviously is happening an excellentmachines I see all these X 's everywhereso here 's the true thing about doingback step 1 you 're a challenging problemhave an emotional reaction actually youknow math is emotional you shouldactually have a motion election we'reall humanthat looks scary and horrible to me soI 'm gon na have a deep breath and justsit and calm my nerves down right nowlittle bit calmer let 's look at this twox Squared 's / 7 x / 6 in an x1 Machine 2X Squared 's I guess you draw that 7 X'sI can do that aha and 6 ones bingothat 's what 2x squared 7 X / 6s isactually some number in this x1 machinegood eye then what is expose to looklike or in an x1 machine or be 1x + 2 11 dot next to two dots so I must bedoing another division problem in somenumber machine it 's just that it 's thismachine now here 's the picture of 2xsquared 4 7 X plus 6I 'm looking for groups of 1 dot next totwo dots or do I see any y yes give memy pen 1 dot next to 2 dots 1 dot X to 2dots there 's one at that level butthere 's another one at that levelremember there must be some explosionsgoing on all the dots are really sittingin the rightmost part of the loop justliketen one machine anymore 1.62 dotsy-yes and here and here three at thatlevel so how do I interpret that answerI 'm seeing two X plus 2 's at the X leveland three at the ones level the answermust be two X 's plus three whoa in factlook what we 've just done look at thesetwo pictures that these pictures areidentical whoa double wall in fact allright so what 's going on why is thispicture of an x-ray machine exactly thesame as this picture for it to ten onemachine we 'll think about this suppose Idid reveal to you now that X really wasten in my head all along what we justdone 110 10 squared hundred thousand weenter 10 one machine and what is thisnumber here well it 'd be two ten squared200 plus seven times ten 76 divided by10 plus 2 that 's 12 apparently equalstwo x 10 xx plus three 276 divided by 12is 23 of course it is what we did overherewhoa so actually I 've just done a highschool algebra question and all itreally is is just a repeat of grade fivebut now in a more general machine infact if it really was a ten on machineit really is exactly the same as gradefive if this was a to one machine thenumbers are now one two four eight whatI got here I 'll have 2 times 2 squared 2times 4 that 's 8 plus 7 times 2 that's14 plus 6all right that 's a 28 divided by 2 plus2 that 's 4 so 28 divided by 4 equalsapparently 2 times 2 4 4 3 7 if this wasa to 1 machines X really was - I 've got28 divided by 4 is 7 which is correct infact I love this approach is what I'mreally doing now is a whole infinitudeof division problems all at once everypossible value of x gives me newdivision problems which I have theanswerbrilliant I 'm not locked to my humanistsanymore I 've gone beyond by human 10oneness to any machine I like that ispowerin fact that is advanced high schoolalgebra and lock reducer to repeat withgrade five so let me clean the boardlet 's do another division problem thismakes one look really scary and I bet wecould do it it 's going to be just dreamso give me a moment to clean the boardall right I 'm back I 'm ready for anadvanced algebra polynomial divisionproblem here it isit looks ghastly but however I thinkit 's going to be just fine it 's reallyan x one machine problem just normallywhat X actually is fine I 'll deal withthat so let me draw this problems I wantto do this top numerator this great bignumber here one X to the fourth - Xcubes 4 x squared 6 X 's and three onesthat 's for the top line is and I'mlooking for groups of the bottom line xsquared plus three all right so what isX square plus three look like let mejust do it up here actually it 's goingto be 1x squared no X 's and three onesso really doing this division problemsI 've got a picture of the top line thereit is and I 'm looking for things thesegroups in that pictureone dot no dots three dots I 'm lookingfor one blank three anywhere in thispicture so I want to find groups of themcan I do it bit the answer is yes allright let 's see can I find some xsquared plus three in this picture onedot no dot three dots why yes here 's onedot is there skip over some no dots andthen let 's do three dot CSS there 's oneat that level remember all the Lotsreally are sitting there there must'vebeen some explosion spoon mobilebaseball epsilon really at that levelany other one blank threes well yesI might split mine at this time hopeit 's okay or do one blank three so oneat that level another one at that levelone blank three so far so goodgrand and what I doing I saw the dothere and I got three dots there look atthat one blank three it 's one at thatlevel there 's my outfit one there twothere one there how do I read thatthat 's at the x-squared level that 's atthe two at the X levels and one I dohave my London right oh nicehi yep one x squared two x 's and one onethe answer must be x squared plus two xplusand here 's the lovely thing because thisreally is a grade five division problemif I just had nacelle the X was actuallyten in my head all along this is a tenmy machine and if a things people seemto forget an algebra class that X canactually be a number I can ask what Ijust done well if X really was ten I'dhave what one two four six or I 'll have12,000 for 63 divided by 103 apparentlyis 121 turns out that 's correct so thereagain another infinitude of problemsdifferent values of X gives me lots ofdifferent long division problems allanswers all at once in one amazing hitjust by drawing picturesI own this idea I can see polynomialdivision despite how scary that looks Iown it I can see it I can do itgood stuff all right grant so let'scarry onyou test
