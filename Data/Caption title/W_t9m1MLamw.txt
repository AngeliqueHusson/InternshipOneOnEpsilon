welcome to another episode of Fort Bendmathematics tutoring take a moment tosoothe your nervesremember these is just numbers theyca n't hurt nobodyhello ladies and gentlemen this is mr.Witte with Fort Bend tutoring andtoday 's tutorial is gon na be aboutconverting decimals to fractions allright let 's start out with the placevalue so here when I 'm dealing withplace value check out this number herewe have thirty four and ninety eightthousand seven hundred sixty-fivehundred thousandths and the bottom lineis I want you to be aware of the placevalue of each of these digits the threeis in the tens place the four is in theones place then you have your decimaland then after that to the right of thedecimal that first place value is calledthe tenths place then your eight is inthe hundredths place your seven is inthe thousandths place the six is in theten thousands place and then finally thefive is in the hundred thousandths placeso these are your place values and ofcourse it continues in either directionbut these are the ones that you 'll seeoften in problems in your math classesall right ladies and gentlemen so let uscontinue here to our first problem let'scheck it out and number one I have sixtenths and remember one place to theright of the decimal is the tenths placeso I 'm going to start by placing thenumber six over ten and then simplifyingit remember all fractions must bereduced it must be simplified and I knowthat I have six and ten that are bothdivisible by two and then I 'll besimplifying this I can reduce both thesix and the ten by twoall right so six divided by two gives methree and then ten divided by two isfiveso my answer here is 3/5 so 6/10 writtenas a fraction is 3/5 and that 's theanswer to problem number one ladies andgentlemen that 's it let 's continue onpronto BRR - in proud number two I have45 hundredths remember I 'm looking atthe smallest place value here and that'sgoing to be the hundredths place twoplaces from the decimal so I 'm going tostart by placing 45 over 100 and we cansimplify this by dividing both thenumeratorthe denominator by five so let 's do thatwe have 45 divided by five which is nineand then 100 divided by five is twentyand nine twenty this ca n't be reducedany further so this ladies and gentlemenis the answer to problem number twothat 's it you got it moving on nextproblem coming up and problem numberthree we have seven and three tenthsyour smallest place value is the tenthsplace so we 're going to be placing 73over ten just like that now noticeladies and gentleman that you do have animproper fraction so this could beconverted into a mixed number if youwished or you can leave it in fractionnotation so in fraction notation itwould remain as 73 tenths or as a mixednumber you would write it as seven beingthe whole number and then you have threetenths so that 's written as three tenthsso depending on the question if theywanted you to write it as a fraction itwould be seventy three tenths as animproper fraction or you could writethis result as a mixed number as 7 and3/10 so either way would be correctdepending on the question so ladies andgentlemen mm-hmm that 's problem numberthree let 's continue on here continue onto our next problem and number four wehave seventy nine thousandths I know I'mdealing with the thousands place becausethe nine is three places to the right ofthe decimal so that means that writingthis as a fraction I will place 79 overthat smallest place value so it 's goingto be over one thousand okay and this isgoing to be the answer to problem numberfour that 's ityou ca n't simplify that any further soseventy nine thousandths is the resultdone and done ladies and gentlemen allright so we 're moving on and moving onto problem number five now in numberfive we have negative four and three tenthousandths my smallest place value isthe ten thousands place that 's fourplaces to the right of the decimal soanytime you 're starting out with anegative value you 're going to end upwith a negative value so I 'm going tostart out knowing that my answer has tobe negative then in fraction notationyou 'll simply place 40,000 three over10,000 so this is going to be youranswer infraction notation if you 're requested towrite your result as a mixed numberyou 'll start off knowing that yourresult will be negative and the wholenumber part of your result is going tobe for it that 's gon na be that value tothe left of the decimal there thenbecause the three is in the tenthousands place you 'll be placing threeover ten thousand and this will be yourresult that 's it so here we havefraction notation in the negative fortythousand three ten thousandths andyou 'll also have the mixed numberwritten as negative four and three tenthousandths which are the answers toproblem number five ladies and john doneand done all right moving on problemnumber six in proud number six you have17 and 15 thousandths that 's right thesmallest place value is the thousandthsplace three places to the right of thedecimal to write this in fractionnotation we have a positive number soour answer will be positive and we'llhave the 17,000 15 in the numerator overyour place value the smallest placevalue which is the thousands place soyou just place that over one thousandjust like that you should note that thenumerator has five as the last digit inthe numerator which means that we cansimplify this further that 's right wecan divide the numerator and thedenominator by five okayso the denominator is easy we know thatone thousand divided by five is going tobe two hundred and in the numeratorwe 'll be dividing that by five sodividing the numerator by five you'llend up with three thousand four hundredthree as your final result so this isgoing to be the fraction notation of 17and 15 thousands just like that allright I 'm gon na go ahead and put a boxaround that for you okayput a red box cuz that 's how I roll withthe red boxes man all right so nowladies and gentlemen we 'll look at themixed number result as a mixed number wewould start out knowing that our wholenumber is 17 so I have 17 as my wholenumber and then from there I know that Iwill have 15 over 1000 because onceagain that five is in the thousandsplace so this is going to be 15 over onefrom there you 're still going tosimplify your result here so I 'm goingto reduce both the numerator and thedenominator by 5 this gives me a resultthat will be seventeen and three twohundredths and this is going to be theresult here all right that 's my answeras a mixed number and so here we haveour result for prod number six andfraction notation wound up with threethousand four hundred three twohundredths and you end up with 17 andthree two hundredths as your mixednumber all right ladies and gentlemenwell that
