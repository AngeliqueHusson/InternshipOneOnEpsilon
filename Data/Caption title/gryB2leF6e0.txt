okay I hope you like my bouleMathematica a free man thank you forlooking that up on your under yes music- I like that I like the bar scene okayso approve triangles are congruent we'regonna go over two methods today mr.racer film two methods to prove trianglescreamer brinkley so check it out do youagree if you drew two triangles likethis okay do you agree that in this sideis congruent to this side and this sidethis side and this side can go into thisside then these two triangles arecongruent yes yes okay there 's a rule orlike a kind of definition of proving twotriangle the same which all their sidesare the same and that 's called doesanyone know yeah you know they 're notequilateral no there 's a really I'mhurted before I 'll tell you right nowit 's called SSS size sizes yeahso if I were to ask you what provesthese two triangles congruent you wouldsay size that side SSS okay that 's onething we 're going to do today and nowhere is another one let us say if youhad a triangle like thisand triangle like thisand this side was congruent to this sideand this side was congruent to this sideand the angle between the two congruentsides was also the same would n't thatlock this side into place do you thinkthen that this angle is the same here inhere and this line ca n't be any offurther out this line ca n't do this sortof thing that would be a bigger angleyeah so these two triangles are alsocongruent these two trend is alsocongruent so if you have an S a side andthen you have an angle and they haveanother side that are going to gothrough itthese would be what service if you areyou see Perez this is my barrette I 'm abreakfast I 'm I 'm a city folk I 'm amodern guy I 'm European essential as fatsome people like thisnow some assume the given statement isthe following and let 's just go aheadand write the proof statement approvetriangle the triangleX is the midpoint of DB giving you tospit given statements did you just makeup this problem no I 'm giving you thegiven right here in the African bongosin France with barrettes here we go guysnow check it out we 're trying to provetwo triangles are congruentwhat are the two ways that we can provetrials from right now Geometry - Triangle Congruence (SSS, SAS) Geometry - Triangle Congruence (SSS, SAS) Geometry - Triangle Congruence (SSS, SAS)
