BRIT CRUISE : When we perform calculationswith a pen and paper , we often needto save intermediate results.And we may do this with , say , scrap paper.And in this case , the paper is actingas a form of external memory.And memory , no matter the form , takes up physical space.Computers contain memory.We can think of it as the scrap paper for the computer.And say , when you construct an arrayto store values in your program , you require memory.And at the lowest level , computersread and store all instructions as a string of numbers.But how do you store numbers in a machine ? This was a very difficult problem originally.Especially when you need computers to hold their memoryafter the access to power is lost.This is known as non-volatile memory.The easiest difference for a machine to detectis simply a presence versus an absence of something.And this is how old punch cards would work.Along the top , we have some data.And the vertical columns contain a seriesof punched holes , which represent each character.So computers really have two fingers , base two.The same as a light switch being on for one and off for zero.This is the smallest amount of information , a single difference , which we call a bit.But bits are powerful for storagebecause the amount of unique statesgrows exponentially as we add bits together.Remember one light switch is one bitand it can store two states.But two light switches can store four unique states.And eight light switches , or 8 bits , can store 256 unique states.And space is measured in bits.But the physical size of a bit dependson your method of storage.So how do computer store zeroes and ones internally ? [ VIDEO PLAYBACK ] SPEAKER 1 : Modern data processing systemslike these use thousands of magnetic cores.What are magnetic cores ? They are tiny rings of nickel alloyor other magnetic materials.They have replaced vacuum tubes for many important functionsin data processing systems . [ END VIDEO PLAYBACK ] BRIT CRUISE : And it allowed computers to store bitsas clockwise versus counterclockwise magnetizationdirection.Because each core could be magnetizedin two different ways , depending which directionthe current was applied . [ VIDEO PLAYBACK ] SPEAKER 1 : Because a bit can be representedby any bi-stable device.And the magnetic core is a bi-stable device . [ END VIDEO PLAYBACK ] BRIT CRUISE : Later on , this was doneusing thin film magnetic disk , wherewe can think of as each a bit as a tiny magnetic cell , whichcan be charged to store either a 1 or a 0.So long story short , the size of a bithas been rapidly shrinking since the days of punch cards.A hard drive in a modern computercan be thought of as billions of tiny magnetic cells.Now you may wonder , well , how smallcan these little magnetic cells be ? And current research at IBM is pushing thisto the atomic level.Where they have shown 12 iron atomscan work together as a stable magnetic unit.Where they 're able to store a 1 or a 0 , depending on how they 're oriented.And this is approaching a theoretical limitwhere we would hold a single bit on a single atom.And interestingly IBM estimates that wecould put around one quadrillion bits of informationin a handheld device the size of an iPod with atomic storage.And let 's call this a super drive.It does n't even exist yet.As a hypothetical example , a small handheld super driveusing atomic storage would hold 1,000 terabits , which is 1,000 trillion switches.Or more commonly known as 125 terabytesin the palm of your hand.Or to use an example everyone can understand,125 terabytes is the same as having a 1,250-kilometer-longbookshelf in the palm of your hand.And this is what the future of memory looks like.Will we ever be able to store a bit on somethingsmaller than an atom ?
