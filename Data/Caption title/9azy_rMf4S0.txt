alright going one problem graph ing equation point one kind really quite graph everything idea kind plot point question following point b c dis solution equation x squared minus plus solution mean first number x arithmetic get number happen point know example solution notice equal x squared minus plus everywhere theres x plug notice first x squared would negative would go away would get value equal first point claim solution plug get one point check really thing simply check notice plug x equal plug x equal one get squared minus times plus squared minus negative plus negative plug one end get second point also solution see plug negative one get equal negative squared minus times negative plus squared positive one negative positive plus plus give c correct found negative one end six point would say solution original equation maybe let check last point make sure plug x equal get equal minus times plus minus negative negative negative yeah get negative point also original equation solution would say c point solution original given equation graph ing equation plotting point example graph ing equation plotting point example
