Okay in this video we 're going to do anotherexample of simplifying comparing fractional expressions.And in this case what we want to do is we want to , want to make the following statement true . Um , we want to compare the fractions 3/4 , 3/4 minus 1/6an 11/12 minus 2/3.We want to think to ourselves , should this be greater than , less than , or equal toto make this true . So we want to figure out which one of thoseuh , three symbols would make this statement true . Um , in this case all we 're going to dois , I 'm going to just simply right the left side is a single fractionwrite the right side is a single fraction and hopefully that 'll be enough to comparethe two.To , to do the arithmetic on the left side we need common denominators.So again the smallest number that four and six will both go into would be12 . So I can multiply the top and bottom ofmy first fraction simply by three . I can multiply top and bottomof the second fraction by two and then I would be left with 9/12 onfirst fraction . Minus2/12 the second fraction and I'm going to go ahead and simplify that down . Nineminus twois going to give us 7/12.And now we 're going to do the same thing for the right side because again I'mnot surewhich , which one of these I should stick in the middle to make this a true statement.Um , so I look at the denominators 12 and threeagain I think the smallest number that both of those will go into will be12.So I 'm gon na leave the first one alone . I 'll multiply top and bottomof the second one by the number four and that 's going to give me 11/12minus8/12 and again if we do the arithmetic11 minus eight is going to give us3/12 and now I think it's pretty clear7/12 is certainly a much greater numberthan 3/12 . So it turns out that we need thegreater than sign to be in between those two expressionsto make that a true statement . test
