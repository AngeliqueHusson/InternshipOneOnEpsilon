yep this is question number 80 ladies inthe back these are the back Kimberly youmight want to take time for the last onebecause if you did n't already write down81 87 and 89 these are last bombs youhave to do for your homework sotherefore if you guys are given a circleall right and you guys are given aradius of 10 and then they say the arclength is 29 all right what do I say iswell what is Theta what is the angle ofactually fisting kebab what is actuallythe angle of this so I said that arclengthlet 's it from here to here is 29 radianswhat is going to be my data what isactually going to be this angle so it'swhat it says this the arc length okayit 's equal to your radius times yourangle which was cos thetaall right so therefore the arc length is29 equals my radius which is 10 timestheta which I do not know trying tosolve so just like you do for any otherquestions when you 're having like no novariable you need to solve for it sothis is both by my time just about thattimeso therefore 29 divided by 10 is 2.9make sure ladies and gentlemen that youunderstand that we 're talking aboutradians right talk about degrees so thisis 2.9 radians not degrees okay sotherefore your angle is in your angle is2.9 test
