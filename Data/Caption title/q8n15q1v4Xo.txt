mat go link perfect youve already shown going well going prove link going going n going going bother dont work going work give us prime sahh give us give us give us match perfect gon na put perfect number match es match es match es match es one match es something get one prime among factor perfect yes theres theres ever one prime factor even perfect number every even perfect number one prime somewhere reason keep saying even gon na stop saying even one ever found odd perfect number one ever prove odd perfect dont exist know could odd perfect number one come across know find odd perfect number going prime factor say perfect number mean even perfect number default look link sho wed factor perfect number sin fact going write multiply get get multiply get get multiply get multiply get thinking whats pattern hereright let say give new prime let say hot press wow found prime know want know perfect number thats fun forget fact first studied ancient get perfect number goodness want know multiply get people se arched sort pattern people go ah obvious square get square get pattern fact squared people go oh wait multiply times ignore fact people find actual pattern equal squared equal equal thats pattern always less number less thats less thats less thats less thats column reckon youd given week wouldnt figured use torment young people get high school student try work pattern basically walk around professional jerk wont give answer come pattern go work theyll try next one wont eventually one k id work smug child ever met justifiably happily retire convinced multiply always always always get perfect number go home say well know know thats always going work havent proven confuse trying example proving something love trying example dont want rain hate trying example parade thats find pattern start got prove going prove always well careful way lot like subtract drift careful copy ing whats quite fun get someone listen pronounce people math rising inflection sand get read go well two n minus two n minus one know mean mat thats good thats put end right end inflection put beginning cant n minus one two n minus one much fun going prove going prove example first going general sense let lazy little ago possible two three people randomly listing memorize factor starting doubling double get double get double get double get double get prime fact get perfect number start keep doubling choose prime choosing get prime instead writing plus going put plus instead going switch prime going continue doubling double going get double get double get fact wasnt memorize number si star ted doubling sequence memorize memorize doubled finish sequence cos know going going switch back number remember said could add number total twice original want put back mix could add could added sum ming get slightly excited look sequence actually sequence times could rewrite equal prime outside thats actually put back get make sequence times sequence thats times equal always bump back next power two becomes actually add together equal multiply together get twice get thats unusual way add together right going thing general equation going going times going show add factor sum give formula rather add factor proper factor sum twice formula factor well got front weve got mean factor definitely going way thats going going whole number obviously big power prime going going going going outside outside way blah blah blah outside outside original number end list like equivalent number end thats actual formula really want show add going show showing together equal twice tha tokay start tidy little bit thats going equal top sequence stay theres still going way one going put front thats going prime number times dada dada going one lot lot thats going equal got minus thats going equal done done prime gave us back done cancel left going way problem earth add together sequence series dont know many dont know add together sequence dont know end little bit cleverness assume know total let say theres equal whatever happen add currently dont know weve given name always first step math sand would twice total two times total well would equal double would become double would become double would become way double would become double would become double actually term going term way fact match apart beginning one end one want cancel take subtract would left one subtract one row minus row equal fact total call geometric series particular case geometric series add together long list sequence one previous one constant amount case multiplying time works swap mess becomes bring outside like well thing missing expect minus havent got gone well like said twice original number want prove equal twice star ted go equal twice times whats left take thats outside thats proof prime multiply guarantee get perfect number take factor expression add together get back twice original expression definition perfect number people talk fact theres link perfect prove thats please
