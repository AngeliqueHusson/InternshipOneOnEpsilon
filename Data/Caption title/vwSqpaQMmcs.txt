g'day sir I would be doing addition sonow that a challenge for us how do youthink we might handle multiplication ofexample what do you think is the mostobvious change tantum type of answer tothis problemtwenty-six hundred four hundredseventeen times three well you 've gotthree seconds to think of an answer Ithink it was three seconds let 's do it Isay the answer was obviously and I meanobviously six eighteen twelve 321 thatwould be sixty eighty two thousandtwelve hundred and thirty 21t brilliantbrilliant I think I 'm right if I don'tprove to you I 'm right he goes I 'll drawa picture of this in a 10-1 machine twosix four one seven looks like this - tenthousand six one thousand four onehundred one ten and seven ones if I saytriple everything well the most obviousthing is okay well I 've got two tenthousand site ripple them they 'll nowhave six ten thousandif I have six hundreds and I say triplethem or six thousand scuse me I don'thave eighteen thousands by four hundredand say triple them they 'll give me what12 hundredths three a110 dribble makesthree tens and 7 ones tripled nexttwenty one ones bingo six eighteentwelve three one sixty eighteen thousandtwelve hundred and three to twenty onebrilliant and of course we could fix usup for the rest of the world by doingsome explosions that maybe we 'll do thisone here tantrum he explodes whatleaving two behind extra dot here makes1966 19,200 3021 Mabel do someexplosions here now two groups of tenexploit what leaving one behind extratwo dots there 619 two five one almostlooking good maybe ten explode from hereleaving what nine behind extra dot herenext seventy-nine thousand two hundredfifty one beautiful so actually we caneven do long multiplication in this waypretty easy oh well I did a single digithere so here 's a good challenge can youfigured a nice way to do longmultiplication with say two digits threedigit numbers here at the end that'skind of fun to think about cool stuffanyhow I love this thinking it makeseverything just so clear and makesperfect sense to me love usyou test
