welcome extended deviation given ghastly scary looking formula people soon science accept bluntly go without kind understanding formula comes well writer video give human story behind explain really evolution difficult goes um loo ked data suppose set something like three five people say look even whats typical value data tend look average scalled new letter mu add number three plus five six plus six believe thats twenty many average value five sense fives typical middle value data thats enough information really sort get whats going data gave set work average thing say negative plus two negative plus seven believe add think minus yep thats divided value also average value sense middle value data data way spread sense data five typical value first sort meaning clustered around number saying typical value data set less meaning theres always spread need sense spread sense deviation mean goes obvious human thing well say look first data set ask far particular data value average well away data value right nose thats away unit away one unit away thats deviation individual data piece whats average deviation think obvious thing measure spread deviation would add individual na divide many got divided thats since deviation one calculation second data set average deviation foul individual data value mean well negative minute away away away away average deviation gosh oh yes divided average spread sense data set tell sense measure deviation grand tell first data set tightly clustered data set spread got intuitive feel sort qualification intruder feel data done whats extra formula well deviation going take data set value maybe well call x case work far mean care far away care left right use make deviation second data value far mean divide many guy youve got theres formula average deviation anyone right mind say thats dont need anything statistical purpose use measure spread fine thats good people dont ill tell people dont absolute value obnoxious theyre totally miserable work know example ked say solve equation absolute value x could without much complain ing say x either negative version negative gave equation like episode value x minus f x minus absolute value minus absolute value x minus absolute value meant equal absolute value x minus solve time mathematically absolute value horrible work mathematician sensible people avoid know seem natural thing talk spread mathematics equation horrendous need somehow though get sense far data value mean positive distance going something ilk without absolute value well next easy thing make positive square let define call average deviation e right moment sort absolute value let square thing type average make perfect sense except trouble scientist talk attached data example maybe dad valid value someone know minus five inch es good difference two inch es plus squared squared human fix problem measure deviation interest squared id rather inch es like obvious thing nothing deep take square root let define measure spread people call sigma standard deviation right thats thats thats going obvious thing absolute value horrible work avoid mimic thing next easiest thing find lightly officer take square root fix natural thing easy data nose suppose five four five five five five everything perfectly ideal world value five theres actually zero prayer theres secret whatsoever deviation fact get five minus five squared zero squared plus zero squared plus zero squared plus line divided divided four zero square root zero zero yep tell zero sprit really right thing mid give measure spread point might complain ing find book dont done change something whoops need get pen back denominator rather working n choose divide minus one mysterious even mysterious making go different author might find actually divided n rather n minus one stick n book book catch confusion ill explain whats going um large number data set thousand data value divided ten thousand nothing affecting calculation much thats good high school student know example test four five dollar value dividing five driven dividing four need sort first answer go whichever book formula cobra textbook goes wobble comes suppose told set five mean five told one doubt data value data value going tobe last id value x need know could work say yes could work told average fives plus plus plus x divided comes formula need quick algebra homework x philosophically dealing data value dont need end one left would enough forgot one less use main value work fourth one philosophically formula n theres really n minus actual information physician scall degree freedom really n minus degree freedom reflect lot statistician say look really dividing n minus actual information n minus instead theres idea know mu begin dont know begin trick work value dont want put right hand side case philosophically want fighting n depend context formula work case dont know mirror beforehand know want form air sort assuming somehow analysis know least philosophically want divide n minus get therefore sort mission machine hand wavy argument n minus divide n get thats truth behind course tal ked volume thinking mathematics book
