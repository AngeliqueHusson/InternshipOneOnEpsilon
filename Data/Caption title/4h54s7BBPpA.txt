Find the domain of f of x is equalto the principal square root of 2x minus 8.So the domain of a function is justthe set of all of the possible valid inputs into the function , or all of the possible values for whichthe function is defined.And when we look at how the function is defined , rightover here , as the square root , the principal square root of 2xminus 8 , it 's only going to be definedwhen it 's taking the principal square rootof a non-negative number.And so 2x minus 8 , it 's only goingto be defined when 2x minus 8 is greater than or equal to 0.It can be 0 , because then you just take the square root of 0is 0.It can be positive.But if this was negative , then all of a sudden , this principle square root function , which we 're assumingis just the plain vanilla one for real numbers , it would not be defined.So this function definition is only defined when 2x minus 8is greater than or equal to 0.And then we could say if 2x minus 8has to be greater than or equal to 0 , we can solve this inequality to seewhat it 's saying about what x has to be.So if we add 8 to both sides of this inequality , you get -- so let me just add 8 to both sides.These 8 's cancel out.You get 2x is greater than or equal to 8.0 plus 8 is 8.And then you divide both sides by 2.Since 2 is a positive number , youdo n't have to swap the inequality.So you divide both sides by 2.And you get x needs to be greater than or equal to 4.So the domain here is the set of all real numbers thatare greater than or equal to 4. xhas to be greater than or equal to 4.Or another way of saying it is this functionis defined when x is greater than or equal to 4.And we 're done .
