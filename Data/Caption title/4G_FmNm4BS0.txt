now the first thing I want to do where Iwant to begin its just with what we didyesterday because I kind of gave me anexplanationbut I sort of stopped short of and Irealized this when people ask mequestions laterjust showing you okay what are the stepsto go through when you just want to workout the answer okay so if you rememberthere were two main shapes two mainprisms that we were after the first onewas the rectangular prism okay so wewo n't deal on this too long I just wantto double check that you 're okay mean ifthey 're working and how you set this outokay question well we 're going to be onpage 218 shortly but that 's when we getinto today 's stuff I just want to tidyup from yesterdaynow rectangular prism okay you 're alwaysgoing to get three dimensions for okaynow with regard to drawing it 's a verygood questiondo you have to draw them you do n't haveto but I mean like just personally I 'm amath teacher I find it so much easierwhenever God drawing they 're even it'snot beautiful like it 's got the rightmeasurements on there I find it a loteasier so understanding get the rightanswer okay so in that way I guess thechoice is yours you have to draw adiagram no I think you 're really hot nowon this rectangular prism rather thanput numbers like 2 3 4 5 or somethinglike that on yes I 'm really very verygeneral about it ok so I 'm going to callthis front one be for breath ok that'show bored it is this one going off intothe distance I 'll call that L for lengthso there 's one distance there andanother distance thereyes yeah okay so we 're gon na get ontovolume in a second but let me let me sayhi to you put on there pretty sure it'son cool now if I wan na if I 'm gonnalearn what the surface area is rememberthat 's how I can get all over faces alladded up together okay so let 's justhave a look at the three faces that wecan see on this side right for instancethis one here in the front that 's goingto be brent times higher right so I'mdoing surface area Yeah right so I'mgonna have H times B now give me thisone okay but then there 's one on thebackremember we talked about this right soif I put my daughter blinds in you'vegot that one over there and it 's exactlythe same so I 'm gon na get two of themokay all right now let 's have a look atthis side that 's facing the right okaythat way rightso it 's L units this way and tall is itit 's it 's H tall right whatever unitthat might be centimeters meterswhatever okay so if I want to work outthat face there it 's gon na be H times Lbut just like this face there 's two ofthemright so I 'll say two of those andthere 's one last one we 've done this onewe 've done this one I suppose we shoulddo the top or the bottom they 're thesame but they 're okay so the bottom forinstance is B times L it 's still anotherrectangle okay so I 'll say B times Ljust like every other face there 's twoof themokay there we go now if you rememberback to them we were doing algebrabecause you 've got twos here everythingis multiplied by two so you can justwrite one so you out the front and putbrackets and that way you do n't have todouble everything you can just do it allin one hithey good there is the surface area of arectangular prism done okay so if youget given a question right and they giveyou actual numbers here like two fourseven something like that okay all youneed to do is put the numbers in theright spots that 's all okay quicklylet 's revise the triangular prism whichis the other 3d shape we were looking atokay so let me just draw one so let'ssee yeah actually do n't just look backat the kinds of examples you 've got I'mjust thinking to myself three four arethey all equal lateral is the pressurementally they are out there they are Isaw my sausage which onesyeah later on later on so let 's justthink if this triangle on the front Ithink they 're mostly equilateral okay soI guess this would be an equilateraltriangular prism I 'll let you have athink of that what would happen it whatwould change if it was n't equilateralokay then anyway there 's the front faceand if we draw some lines out like thatthere 's the rest of it I guessokay so there 's my triangle in prisonright now I 'm going to approach it inmuch the same way I need somemeasurements though do n't know just likehere I had three measurements I 'm gonnahave three here right so I 'm gon na callthem very similar ones I 'm gon na callthis one again B but this time B forbase because that 's what usually sametriangle what else do we need to workout the area we made that that heightthere right okay so you 've got thisheight here but it 's kind of importantthat 's perpendicular so drawing a littlewide angle there so you know it 's aperpendicular height and then I think wesaid like okay good now we 're trying todo sub serie right so just like the fullwe 'll take a one step at a time okay nowit 's a triangular prism so let 's startwith triangle right right in the fronthere okay it 's base there 's a heightwhat 's the area now for triangles basetimes height on to is n't it right buthow many triangles are there to do thesurface there 's two there 's one on thefront and one on the back yeahso it 's actually two times and you'llsee those will cancel in a second okaynow we 've done triangles what otherkinds of faces do we have yeah so I'vegot one I should I should do it in adifferent color okay I do n't one fromthis side one from this side of in oneof the dentin okay so I 've got three ofthese rectangles so three times nowwhat 's the area of each of therectanglesnow it 's gon na be there 's gon na belengths involved right because therectangular means that length there butif you for example if I just drew thebase the bottom part right it would looklike this you see I 'm just taking thatpot ignoring that 's the lines there yougot be this way and you 've got L thisway right so what 's the area of thatwriting yeah that 's rightOh B right now he 's the useful thing andthis is why we I was around as towhether it 's been collateral or notright because all of these sides areequal they 're right that means this isthe same as the base right and so isthis all the rectangles all three ofthem they 're all same so this is whatI 'm gon na get base times height thereyou go that 's a triangular prismokay supposing all of the sides of thetriangle are the same now please do tellme later on if you get to an exercisethe one on the page I 'm looking at theyare all equilateral if they 're not thenthat 's a bit different and we 'll have alook at that one again but this is justrevision
