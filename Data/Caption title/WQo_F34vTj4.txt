a histogram is just a special kind ofcolander in fact that 's basically whathistogram beansI went and dug it up it has to do withthis plan here is histor this sort ofprep it has to do with anything that'supright like for example got masts andsails of a ship right so it 's a columngraph as you can see but it has a coupleof minor differences so underneath herenumber one you 'll notice I sort ofPrince out here when we 're doing clowngraphs before do you see they 're gonnagraph the gaps between the differentcolumns do you see that so it 's got nogaps between columnsso that 's a little buying a differenceand secondly you will see there 's agraph a gap keeps a graph there 's a gapat the beginning right so there is a gapwith the axis the vertical oneokay so apart from that is just aregular column graph as you 're sayingnow when you get your data what you'reputting up onto the vertical scale ispretty much always frequency so thankssometimes your basic series callfrequency histograms this is rememberhow we said sometimes you choose thisfor vertical that for horizontal you'llalways see frequency over here okay nowif I take the midpoints of all of thesecolumns okay so you might want to getanother color in here so if we join themidpoints and you also take that linewhich joins of these points and youconnect it down to the horizontal axisokay so join the midpoints and thehorizontal axiswhat you 've made as is labeled up on thescreen is a frequency polygon becauseyou have a shape that connectseverything so this is like a phantomline graph okay this is the one swipesome people also you just left lastlesson this is the one time where yourdata here it it starts here but actuallyyou 're going to drag down the bottom soit 's a polygon okay so if you join theirmidpoints and the horizontal axis that'swhat you do to create a frequency tableyeah I 'm so glad you 're here so when wejust have a normal over here ah normalfrequency okay there yes it 's themidpoints as demonstrated but there is acase when we do n't do the midpoints butwe do the corners so I 'm going to showthat to you in just a second just wantyou to get this is a frequency histogramand therefore this is a frequencypolygon question well what 's these arehaving a line graph what do we use thosefor a useful yeah good if there 's atrend or like a pattern from like allthe different temperatures howfrequently I get them that 's all it'saboutI think you just try to make it moreobvious and sometimes maybe what shouldwhat is just the frequency of polygonsand you might not draw the originalhistogramlike just it might be too muchinformation for you some just want thatmake it a little cleaner maybe okay allright today no one else have anyquestions on the frequencies wherefrequency falls over before does thatmake sense yeah okay so now this is whatum who ops to asked about ash when we'retalking about well where are we joiningI 'm going to show you this so this isever so slightly different that was justlike this is not a frequency histogramit 's not a frequency polygon have a lookat the vertical axis it 's no frequencyis just why these things climbing okayso now underneath here this is just aregular frequency consisting Ram andprologue I 've run out of space here butif you can make a little subheading forme which is not frequency but cumulativefrequencyhistory histograms and you got somemoney here in Szczecin right so let'slook at what 's coming firstyou still got columns which do n't havegaps and still have a gap in thevertical axis but what 's different howthey look at my polygon and see where itjoins okay I 'm not at the midpoints evilmonkey here and so on and at the cornersthe way I describe it is I 'm joining totalk right corner of every column doesthat make sense so I 've still got thesefeatures here but to make a cumulativefrequency polygon to create a cumulativefrequency polygon instead of joining themidpoints I 'm going to join the top backcornersone last thing on this guy because youcan see it 's going to end up all the wayup at the top okaythis is meant to be a thing that'sclimbing presumably if I had highertemperatures on here 24 35 36 etc thiswould keep on going up and up and up sofor that reason rather than this onewhich comes back down to the bottom okaybecause well this is the shape of thingsright in the cumulative frequencypolygon if this diagram continued itwould n't go down it 's meant toaccumulate it 's meant to get biggerright so that 's why you can see it endsup there and it does n't return okay soyou can say do n't rejoin the horizontalaxisnow this graph comes up so much so manypeople use it that it gets its ownspecial name and maybe you 've had aspecial name before it 's in on no one'scorpse that 's been waiting twice it'skind of it 's very very close yeah Ido n't really know how to pronounce thisI say I say alive but I mean you couldsay forgive if you like because theywere just or yeah you would say yourdrive is totally in roll call thismorning that it was ogivesyeah to be honest I 've no idea how youpronounce it so long as you spell itright and you know what it 's talkingabout cuz you pretty much would have tosay it except to your friends againother guy all it is is another name fora cumulative frequency polygon that guythe green one okay right no one morepoint before I read this to you rememberI started by saying history of a kindjust like a special poem rap why do wehave these they 're not that differentokay I will show you one um in the restof the world this is what people thinkof when they think of a histogram okaynow I want you to look at it whatstrikes you as strange about this chartis grown there are chunks there arechunks I need to think about the chunksI mean just come back it says chunks -yeah okay so there 's a couple of thingshappening going on at the same time abit uneven and the reason they 're unevenis because these things down herethinking backs like last week a fewlessons ago these are not individualscores they 're yeah it 's a range theseare classes or intervals you mightremember those words from before we'vedone now what 's going on here the ideais that okay people age 1 to 6 how manyare there new age 6 to 8 people aged 8to 11 you have different ranges thewidth of a column means there are morepeople there okay so to compensate thisguy over here is actually not a timethere 's not eight people who are agedonetwo-six because it 's wider this is goingto go up this is actually one two threefour five squares you can actually justsee them right so there 's actually fivetimes eight there are 40 people in thisclass right a bigger rectangle meanswith more people this is trying to getaway from the a misleading graphs werelooking at before where people used areaand it 's a bit sneaky or volume have alook how many people are aged six toeighthow would you read it there are going tobe its twenty five but it 's two one soit 'll be 40 and you can go by the sameprinciple and say this goes up tothirteen and that 's three white so thatwould be 39 points now if that feelsweird and confusing to you then you'renot alone the people who designed themassive asset that 's crazy and confusingdo n't care if the rest of the world doesthat we 're not gon na deal withhistograms have to have this weird funkything down here so that 's why that 's whyfor us for all intents and purposes theybasically just color graphs without gapsthat 's basic okay however you go out inthe real world for you and catch youanother country right and they 're likehey yeah this thing right I did used tograb but the wit is meaningful asopposed to for us but with you beingokay Histograms Histograms Histograms
