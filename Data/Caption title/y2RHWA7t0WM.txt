We 're asked to sort the following units of measurementinto two categories : U.S. customaryunits and metric units.So these are just two different systems . You 'll getmore and more familiar with them.Then indicate whether each unit measures length , weight , mass , or volume.Let 's do the first . Let 's see which of these are U.S.customary unit versus metric units.So the liter is a metric unit.You would use it in the metric system.A gallon is a U.S. customary unit.We 've been dealing with that.If you fill your gasoline in Europe , you 're going to befilling it in terms of liters.In the U.S. , you 're going to be fillingit in terms of gallons.And we 're going to talk about whether they 're units ofvolume and whatnot in a little bit.Decigram , that is metric system.In general , whenever you see these prefixes , deci , centi , kilo , you 're dealing with the metric system.No one ever talks about a kilopound.I guess you could , but no one really talks about it.Same thing , millimeter.This is metric system.A gram is metric system.Meter is metric system.The foot is a U.S. customary unit.We 'll talk about whether it's distance or any of that in alittle bit.Kilogram , once again , it is metric units.In case you have n't gotten what I 'm doing here , blue formetric , red for U.S. customary units , or I guess magenta.Centiliter , that is metric.Centimeter , meters are metric.And notice we have the prefix in both cases.Centi means 1/100.Cup , that is U.S. customary units.I have to do that in the magenta.Cup , U.S. customary units.Meter , that is the metric system.Pound , U.S. customary units.It 's getting a little tedious.Inch , same thing , that 's what we use in the U.S . Ounce , weuse that in the U.S. And then the yard , we also use that inthe U.S.Now we 've divided them up.All the magenta ones are used in the U.S. All of the blueones are used really in the rest of the world , andactually some places in the U.S. as well.I think a lot of the world is frustrated that the U.S. , thatwe 're not all converted to this because the metric systemis actually a little bit more logical.It 's easy to just figure out what it 's saying , and we'lldeal with that in more detail in the future.Now the next thing we to figure out is whethersomething is a measure of length , weight/mass -- andthey 're not exactly the same thing.Mass is how much of a substance you have . Weight ishow much force with which gravity ispulling on that mass.And it would change depending on what planet you 're on.But on Earth , they tend to be used interchangeably , so we'lluse it roughly interchangeably here.And then you have volume , or how much spacesomething takes up.So this is distance.This is moving in one dimension.Mass is how much stuff there is.Weight is how much the force that stuff is pulled on , on aplanet , by gravity , or I guess a star anywhere.And volume is how much space does that stuff take up.Now let 's think about it.Liter is volume.This right here is volume.How much space do you take up.Gallon is also volume.That 's in the U.S. And in Europe , or in the metricsystem , it would be a liter.That 's a gram.Gram is a unit of mass.So decigram just means 1/10 of a gram.Millimeter.Meter is a unit.Meter right here , that is the unit of distance or of length.Millimeter , milli means 1/1,000 of a meter.Foot , that is also a unit of length.Kilogram , that just means 1,000 grams.Kilo means a thousand.Gram , we already said , is a unit of mass.Centiliter , that means 1/100 of a liter.Liter , we already figured out , is a unit of volume.Centimeter , we already figured out.Meter is a unit of length.Centimeter means 1/100 of a meter.So this is a unit of length.Cup , we 've seen multiple times already.It is a unit of volume , how much space doessomething take up.Meter , that is length.We 've seen it multiple times already.Pound , that is actually a unit of weight.An inch is a unit of length.We 're all familiar with it.An ounce -- you have to be careful here -- if someone justhas an ounce , that is 1/16 of a pound.It as a unit of weight.If it was written fluid ounce , then we 'd be talking about1/16 of a pint , and then it would be a unit of volume.But since it 's just ounce , it 's a unit ofweight , 1/16 of a pound.And then finally , a yard is a unit of length.And we are done . test
