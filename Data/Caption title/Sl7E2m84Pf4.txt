determinant really complicated dealing determinant higher definitely want able simplify three rule allow first determinant factor constant row column example got common factor row stake look last row common factor pull right put front compute determinant instead compute simpler determinant multiply result could actually factor factor top row get x forth keep determinate becomes nice simple thing could add multiple one row another goes column example probably like expand along row column swith lot well create cleverly one row column another done first column four added third column column four times plus right four times add negative get zero whole column interesting row operation column operation case n change determinant always add multiple row another row multiple column another column n change value third thing interchange two row two column example know say reason want left switch first two two column switched whenever switch two row sign determinant three thing would determine simplify factor constant row column add multiple one row another row goes column three interchange two column two remember change simplify ing determinant simplify ing determinant simplify ing determinant simplify ing determinant simplify ing determinant simplify ing determinant simplify ing determinant simplify ing determinant simplify ing determinant
