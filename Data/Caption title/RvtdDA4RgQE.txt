new job new job yeah senator president math teacher yeah today gon na inverse trig function perhaps youve seen gon na give brief reminder gon na fun like easily stay right take sine take sine type thing angle correct put take sine angle angle type thing almost say sine decide sides sides yeah like say sine right sides right opposite hypotenuse sides ratio put ratio sides take sine cosine angle tangent turns ratio sides thats great saw yes inverse sine think ratio oh thats right yes cement new construction project job creation angle yes inverse sine ratio equal angle angle thats basically idea let actually try one leave second get used cosine inverse cosine root three two right let stalk root angle ratio ratio question angle whose cosine root may actually go yeah use calculator well let understand agree searching angle dont know angle case right put root put opposite one triangle x well yes would x case thing ever blank triangle could always solve squared plus root squared yes yes impossible right squared plus squared plus equal squared squared thank yeah squared oh good standard triangle ever blank problem always use derive hard hard would angle well going bigger size right root would degree want radian cosine root degree inverse trig ratio inverse trig ratio equal soh right thats skinny yeah thank much ahead thought whole concept ask mistake yes degree good catch zero pi right oh two pi would four evolution thats right want think degree degree yes well could see problem four minute guinea know like degree fraction degree six six agree degree one sixth degree yes therefore one sixth pi one six one six pi thats correct gon na call pi six million hundred eighty degree pi yes yeah want sixth hundred eighty make thirty device divided six bravo good thats good get roll let go huh right let go angle dont know opposite adjacent opposite adjacent yes yes ill way root divide everything root let see happen triangle become divided root let every multiply bottom top becomes weight job bottom becomes good go becomes yeah thats root set root write root sorry delay root right ago root angle searching degree thank sunset root say original problem thank let let make clear root really root thats change root root didnt see inside star ted radian mode go back room know go back depend answer little problem radian radiant answer would radian angle measure degree paper get pi pi unlike formal exam would tell whether answer answer ing radian math yes map depend want express angle want affect angle every let talk sine inverse sine one third one third angle ratio ratio let ratio angle dont know one go three go sign right sine opposite hypotenuse good thats part triangle angle whose sine one third right yes want sine angle sine angle whats sine ai dont need check inverse sine one third angle whose sine one third want sine ill bring sine sine one third sine whats sine angle recall take sine angle lead type good one one three yeah didnt know already line negative sine inverse sine one third theres one third wouldnt didnt oh inverse sine negative one third sine inverse sine one angle dont know angle get angle mode yes get different degree mode inverse sine please radian mode go back reese oh inverse sign yeah nineteen point four seven nineteen point five angle nineteen point five degree inverse sine one third angle nineteen point five whats sine angle word one sign inverse sine cancel yes theyre inverse function negative one yes sure sign inverse sine right good let leave cotangent inverse sine one third right cotangent inverse sine one third inverse sine one third angle happen nineteen point five degree dont care ninety want cotangent angle say whats cotangent angle sine inverse sine one third result angle go tangent one nineteen point nine two five angle measure whats cotangent angle good really getting closer right get gon na get ratio please define cotangent thats good ill leave said going believe thats tangent agree cotangent reciprocal times yeah adjacent opposite whats adjacent side dont know get yes music know mean let theorem shirt sure saying cotangent inverse sine inverse sine one third angle nineteen point five doesnt matter nineteen point five basically angle sign thats true sine angle one third sine number yes sine angle one third angle sign thats whatever angle though want cotangent angle want cotangent angle cotangent cotangent angle result ratio get ratio cotangent one squared plus b squared plus b squared b squared equal simplify square root ing sides like point nose simplify root eight two point eight simplify square root eight eight perfect square know whats inside perfect square times square root root root tangent opposite adjacent cotangent would reciprocal adjacent opposite yeah yeah tur u tur u tur u opposite oh yes thank focus ing see root dont need write theyre going get better theyre going get better right keep gon na see pattern start trigonometry inverse trigonometric function
