sha stand secure hash algorithm interesting given kind broken going talk specifically attack sha today thats different video wan ted talk little bit detail hash function sha particular works get idea kind way thing quick look hash function briefly got somebody covered video gone lot might use hash function kind hash talking weve talking password quite slow sense need secure going talk mostly hash function used routinely cryptography thing like message authentication digital signature need fairly quick verify compute hash function take string right let say turns fixed length string thats usually three long random know bit string right forward way however many hash function theres important hash care cryptography important one perhaps essentially mean put get something way like appear completely random us change even slightly appear ing random completely let quick look example see page script calculate fly put see hash way right hash hash long change c hash completely change theres appearance randomness idea hash actually related even though know put c back back use verify message havent change verify signature certificate sand knowing appearance randomness actually random today going talk bit actually write hash function thishow take something essentially random known structure turn something look like nonsense use people raising eyebrow example actually theres fairly reasonable reason first know might also talk weakness es point also bear striking similarity structure see lot use historically currently sense standard everyone right quite different thats something else another release lot people dont trust thing n sa sort default might fair case actually quite good long long time concern recently much serious concern originally n sa werent back door stuff n sa need cryptography like everyone else good lot problem basically extend make take length string output bit value alright question becomes got string could could incredibly long file know whole movie right want calculate signature even get star ted well answer basically loop bit block data one time file let look example works single message exactly right length well talk briefly inevitably right length almost always right take message n block length one block message exactly length run essence put hash end internal state bring message one time change internal state weve done end theres message left read internal state thats hash alright going basically taking internal state dating message run message soon process read sha family hash function works internal state call h going say internal state exactly length hash word four know machine would initialize based constant defined standard might talk bit important going update h bring message end well see h thats hash function well something cal led compression function going take data bit message turn another set h value thats going repeat message thats going happen time message exactly handy compression function going rename slightly confuse everyone dearly beginning compression function copy b internal state b c ewe perform char compression function right like x thats going take word bit block message message message going come point mixed well wont talk exactly whats going compression function idea combined together theyre commute around make look random go time message increase appearance mandamus also make sure shower function calculating digest specific message rather general one thats every time message always going perform exact algorithm put message second time shower function produce exactly result weve done left b c finish block h value value hereto create new h state update whatever compression function right addition char done without overflow modulo well mean ever go maximum value integer lap back around right one shark arm reverse might lose information way encryption dont need able reverse state finished message exactly need value hash short message could know go actual fact principle extending arbitrary length message right increment copy state back top repeat process copy back repeat process many block message time message feed alter state approach lead state done right thats basically works security sha compression function shorter multiple going padding right char works bit block message let long message want pad start one pad alright going sort mark demark padding know go finish message length actual message know sort remove padding case binary would lot length done get idea padding message length message end way similar ways dont share padding dont end thats important approach sha internal state compression function essence cal led merk el guard construction sort independently proved murk land damn god essentially whats good compression function good good pseudo random shower function course useful right problem compression function char one good attack reduced somewhat something like becomes realm possibility people lot money sha secure hash ing
