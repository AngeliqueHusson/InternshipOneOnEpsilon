ked find conjugate complex minus going find video finding conjugate complex number shockingly easy really number little bit particular real part conjugate going exact real part imaginary part going opposite sign instead negative positive right complex conjugate minus sometimes notation minus minus put line like mean want conjugate minus equal plus sometimes someone write see z variable people often use complex z minus theyll say complex conjugate z put line z going plus probably saying k fairly straightforward find conjugate complex number good reason basic place useful multiply complex number times conjugate going get real number want emphasize right plus conjugate minus minus also conjugate plus obvious star ted change sign imaginary part would get minus conjugate let show multiply complex get real number let multiply minus times plus blue minus times plus remember whenever multiply expression really multiply every term times could distributive property twice could something like foil remind multiply every part complex number times every complex number let times times negative times negative see imaginary part cancel ing negative times positive thats negative negative squared remember negative negative squared let write negative times negative times squared negative negative times negative positive two guy cancel left plus let see plus left real number way n even distributive property might recognize like something minus something times something plus something know pattern early algebra plus b times minus b equal squared minus b squared equal difference square sand case squared b case squared squared squared negative subtract ing going positive plus add together get complex conjugate example imaginary complex khan academy complex conjugate example imaginary complex khan academy complex conjugate example imaginary complex khan academy complex conjugate example imaginary complex khan academy complex conjugate example imaginary complex khan academy complex conjugate example imaginary complex khan academy
