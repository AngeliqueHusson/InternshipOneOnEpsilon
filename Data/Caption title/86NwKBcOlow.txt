Create a graph of the linear equation 5x plus 2yis equal to 20.So the line is essentially the setof all coordinate , all x 's and y 's , thatsatisfy this relationship right over here.To make things simpler , what we 're going to dois set up a table where we 're goingto put a bunch of x values in and then figure outthe corresponding y value based on this relationship.But to make it a little bit simpler , I 'm going to solve for y here.So it becomes easier to solve for y for any given x.So we have 5x plus 2y is equal to 20.If we want to solve for y , let 's justget rid of the 5x on the left-hand side.So let 's subtract 5x from both sides of this equation.The left-hand side , these guys cancel out , so we get 2y is equal to the right hand side , you have 20 minus 5x.And then you can divide both sides of this equation by 2.So you divide both sides by 2.The left-hand side , we just have a y , and thenthe right-hand side , we could leave it that way.That actually would be a pretty straightforward wayto leave it , or we could call this 20 divided by 2is 10 minus 5x over 2 or minus 5/2 times x.And so now using this , let 's justcome up with a bunch of x values and seewhat the corresponding y values are , and then just plot them.So let me do this in a new color.So let me -- a slightly different shade of yellow.So we have x values , and then let'sthink about what the corresponding yvalue is going to be.So I 'll start , well , I could start anywhere.I 'll start at x is equal to 0 , just because thattends to keep things pretty simple.If x is 0 , then y is equal to 10 minus 5/2 times0 , which is equal to 5/2 times 0 is just a 0.So it 's just 10 minus 0 or 10.So that gives us the coordinate , the point , 0 comma 10.When x is 0 , y is 10.So x is 0.So it 's going to be right here at the middle of the x-axis.And you go up 10 for the y-coordinate.1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10.So it 's right over here.So that 's the point 0 comma 10.Let 's do another point.Let 's say that x is 2.I 'm going to pick multiples of 2 herejust so that I get a nice clean answer here.So when x is 2 , then y is equal to 10 minus 5/2 times 2 , and the 2 in the denominator cancels outwith this 2 in the numerator.So it simplifies to 10 minus 5 , or just 5.So that tells us the point x equals 2 , y is equal to 5 , is on the line.So 2x is equal to 1 , 2 right over here.And then y is equal to 5.You go up 5.1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , just like that.So that 's the point 2 , 5.And when you 're drawing a line you actuallyjust need two points.If you have a ruler or any kind of straight edge , we could just connect these two points.And if we do it neatly , every point on that lineshould satisfy this relationship right here.Just so we get practice , I 'll do more points.So let me do , let 's say when x is equal to 4 , then y is equal to 10 minus 5/2 times 4.This is equal to 5/2 times 4.This is equal to 10 , right ? Because the 2 , divide the denominator by 2 you get 1 , divide the numerator by 2 you get 2 , or 4 over 2is the same thing as 2.So it becomes 2 times 5 is 10 , 10 minus 10 is 0.So the point 4 comma 0 is on our line.So x is 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , and then y is 0.So we do n't move up at all , so we have 4 comma 0.And I could keep going.I could try other points.You could do them if you like , but this is plenty.Just two of these would have been enough to draw the line.So let me just draw it.So I 'll do it in white.So the line will look something like this.And I could keep going in both directions.So there you have it.That is the graph of our linear equation.Let me make my line a little bit bolder , just in case you found that first line hard to read.So let me make it a little bit bolder.And I think you get the general idea . test
