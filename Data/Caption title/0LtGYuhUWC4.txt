welcome first video posting discrete mathematics thought nice place start discrete mathematics binomial coefficient inside never seen n click check channel give five really cool video going prove n choose k turn coefficient expansion plus b power n combinatorial proof going explain taken high school math probably seen following plus b squared equal plus b times plus b work get squared plus two b plus b squared may even fact ever thought generally take plus b power one well plus b little bit boring could keep going could say plus b power zero anything power zero let skip start getting bigger say plus b power three write plus b times multiply together find get power three plus three times squared b plus three times b squared plus b cube stop moment look see coefficient one coefficient one one writing first get another one next expansion get anda next get building may find interesting may even hear memorize fact find type expansion video going case fact going prove plus b power n equal summation k equal n taking term n choose k times n minus k times b k integer bigger equal zero case little bit unfamiliar summation notation equal let think k equal get n power n bis power n need plus choose times power n minus times b keep going get n choose power b power n hear talking n choose k refer binomial coefficient especially talk triangle reason scalled binomial coefficient occur coefficient expansion binomial expression may interested know indeed generalization multinomial coefficient video going focus n choose k binomial coefficient going proof make sure little example sup make sense term written let look plus b power three look ended power three coefficient one coefficient one like three zero one way select zero thing collection three thing get coefficient one next coefficient three choose one indeed equal three see power decrease done one power b one similarly next coefficient three choose two power power b final term b power three coefficient one like three choose three working proof make sure convinced fact hold small case proof let start writing plus b power mean take plus b times plus b times plus b keep going done thatn times going call first piece second one second piece third piece nth piece let think carefully would expand get full product quick reminder let scroll back little example let say n right top plus b times plus b expand look different combination could happen look times give us selected selected selected first piece selected piece next thing could multiply b would selected b give us one term b happen select band happen us right finally could selected b first piece b piece give us term right learned looking select either theb end final product learned form term final product selected either b end piece mean general term look like coefficient write coefficient times power let call times b power let call k plus k equal n since n piece product going coefficient times power n minus k times b power k form term final expansion b power k must selected b k end piece choose k possible ways also selected n minus k piece many ways n minus k choose n minus k equal therefore coefficient equal n choose k complete proof recap know generic term look coefficient know n choose k times power n minus k times b k generic term look possible term would gotten sum get expansion right video n forget see next time discrete math binomial coefficient triangle discrete math binomial coefficient triangle discrete math binomial coefficient triangle discrete math binomial coefficient triangle discrete math binomial coefficient triangle discrete math binomial coefficient triangle discrete math binomial coefficient triangle discrete math binomial coefficient triangle discrete math binomial coefficient triangle discrete math binomial coefficient triangle discrete math binomial coefficient triangle discrete math binomial coefficient triangle discrete math binomial coefficient triangle discrete math binomial coefficient triangle discrete math binomial coefficient triangle
