The owner of a restaurant wants to find out more aboutwhere his patrons are coming from.One day , he decided to gather dataabout the distance in miles that peoplecommuted to get to his restaurant.People reported the following distances traveled.So this is our data right over here.He wants to create a graph that helps them understandthe spread of the distances and the median distancethat people travel.What kind of a graph should he create ? And you can plot this data in many different types of graphs , but they tend to depict things in different ways.For example , a line graph shows a trend over time.He 's not interested in a trend over time , so a line graph does n't make sense.Or a line graph could be a trend of one variable with respectto another variable.It does n't just have to be time.But he does n't want to see a trend here.A bar graph is good when you 're tryingto bucket things , put things into bucketsand see how those buckets are performing.Once again , that 's not exactly what he wants to see.A pie graph , if you want to see kindof how things make up a whole.That 's not what he wants to see right over here.A stem and leaf plot does help with distributionsa little bit , but it really doesn'ttackle the median distance and the spread really , really well.So the one that does , and especiallywhen people talk about medians and spread , is a box and whiskers plot.And I 'll show you how to do it right now.Box and whiskers.And what a box and whisker plot literally doesis it shows the spread of the data.It splits it into quartiles.And I 'll talk about that in a second.And it also tells you where the median of the data actually is.And that 's one of the things that the ownerof the restaurant cares about.So whenever you're dealing with medians -- and box and whisker plots deal with medians -- the first thingyou want to do is order all the numbersbecause the median is really the middle number whenyou order them all up.So let 's order this.So let 's write it in order.So first we have 1.So we get rid of that 1.Then we have one 2 right over here.And then we have another 2 right over there.That 's all of our 2's.Then we have this 3 , that 3 , and then we have that 3.So those are two people who have to travel3 miles to the restaurant.Then let 's see , do we have any 4 's ? We have one 4 right over there.And then we have another 4 right over there.Then , let 's see , do we have any 5 's ? Actually , I just realized that I skipped one of the 1's.We have another 1 right over there.So let 's write that 1 right over there.We actually had two 1's.And then let 's see.Do we have any 5 's ? We do not have any 5 's over here.Do we have any 6 's ? We have one 6 right over here.And then we have no more 6's.Do we have any 7 's ? We have one 7 right over there.8's.We have an 8 right over there and that 's the only one.Let 's see.Do we have any 9 's ? No 9's.Any 10 's ? Yes , we have a 10.Do we have an 11 ? Yep.11.Do we have any 12 's ? No 12 's , no 13's.14 ? 14.And we have a 15.People must like this restaurant.They 're traveling a good bit.Then we have a 20 and then we have a 22.So I 've ordered all the numbers.Let me make sure I have n't skipped or gottensome duplicates.So 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 , 16,17 people were surveyed , 17 patrons of the restaurant.And we have 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 , 15,16 , 17.All right.Seems like I 've got all of them and I 've ordered them now.Now the median is the middle number.We just said that we had 17 of these numbers.So we want the number -- and since it'san odd number of numbers , the median actuallywill be one of these numbers.It 's actually the middle number.It 'll be the number where eight are largerand eight are smaller.So 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8.So it looks like this is our median.It will be the ninth number.And then you have 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 that are larger.So eight are smaller than 6 , eight are larger than 6.So 6 is the middle number.If we had an even number of numbers here , if we had two middle numbers , then wewould take the average of them.When you have an odd number of data points , then you can just take the middle one.So this one right over here is our median.And then when you do a box plot , what you want to dois you want to find the median of the set of numbersthat are smaller than the median.And you also want to find the median of the set of numbersthat are larger than the median.These are called the first quartileand the second quartile.Because when you do that , you split your datainto four sections , or quartiles . `` Quar , '' you 'd normally associate with four.So let 's look at the set that 's smaller than 6.So we have 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 numbers.So it 's an eight.If you have eight data points , you'regoing to actually have two middle numbers.So for example , you have these two right over hereare the two middle numbers -- three less , three more.You ca n't just pick the 2 because if you justpicked the 2 , you 'd have three less and four more.And you ca n't just pick the 3 because then youwould have three more and four less.So these are our middle two numbers.So the median of this group right over here is 2.5.I averaged these middle two numbers.And then let 's do it over here with this group.I 'll do it in blue.So once again , we have eight numbers.You 're going to have two middles.And so it 's going to be the third and the fourth number , which is 11 and 14.And if you average 11 and 14 -- let 's see.11 plus 14 is 25 , divided by 2 is 12.5 , is 12.5.So this essentially divides the data into four sections.You have everything up to this first quartile.So you have this first section right over here , this first median of the lower half of the data is 2.5.Then you have everything between 2.5 and 6 , then 6 to 12.5 , and then everything more than 12.5.And so what a box and whisker plotis essentially a graphical depictionof this right over here.So let 's do that.I 'm going to set up a number line.So let me draw a number line as straight as possible.So let 's say that is my number line.And let 's say that this is 0.And let 's say that this is -- I want to make it.So let 's say that this is 10.And then this would be 20.And then this would be 5.This would be -- let me do it a little bit cleaner than that.This would be 15.25 would be right around there.So first thing on the box and whiskers plot , you want to show the entire range of data.So our smallest data point starts at 1.So 1 is right about here.So if I do -- so this is 2.5.So 1 is right about here.And then our largest data point is 22.22 would sit right about there.And I 'll even label it , although you oftenwo n't see it labeled like that.That 's 1.And then that is 22.And then the middle half of the data , we do with a box.So the middle half is this quartileand this quartile right over there.So the second quartile starts at 2.5.So 2.5 is right there.So this is where we start our box , 2.5.And then our third quartile starts at 12.5.So 12.5 is right over there.12.5 is right over there.And then we can draw a box.I 'll draw the box in a neutral color.I 'll do it actually in that yellow color.So let me draw the box here.So the box shows where the middle half of our data is.And now I can draw these two arrows , these.So that 's the box part.And then these two arrows are whatyou would call the whiskers.And that shows where all the other data is.So it 's really showing the spread of the data.And then the last thing we need to show is the actual median.And the median -- I 'll do it in purple -- we already figured outis 6.So the median sits right about -- see , this is 5.This would 7.5.6 would be right over there.So with this one diagram , you 've actuallydepicted all of this information in termsof where is the median.The median is at 6.That is 6 right over there.Where is the middle half of the data ? Well , it 's between 2.5 and 12.5 , between 2.5 and 12.5.And all of the data , the entire spread for all of the customerssits between -- and this is what the whiskers do for us.It sits between 1 and it sits between 22.And if you wanted to color code it a little bit better -- let me do that just because it 's fun.So this data right over here -- and really , if you think about it , it's including this data too.That 's what this whisker is depicting.This data right over -- Let me do that in a different color.This data right over here is kindof the first half of the box.That data right over here.Then you have your median in magenta.Then this data right over here is the second part of the box.So it 's all of this stuff right over here.And then finally , let me pick a new colorthat I have n't used yet.This data is kind of represented by this part , by this whisker right over here.Now there 's one thing I want to leave youwith is that I used a method for this box and whisker diagram.I found the median.I use a method where the two halves , I got rid of the medianand I found the median of this part , and I found the median of that part.And that 's the more typical methodfor box and whisker plots.Sometimes when you find the median of the lowerhalf and the upper half , some peoplewill include this median in both sets when they calculate it.But I just want to let you know that 's out there.But the way that I did it is actuallythe more mainstream way.That 's the way most calculators , I believe , actually will do a box and whisker plot . test
