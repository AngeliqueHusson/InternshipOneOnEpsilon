[ Music ] super serious math question are theretwo people in the world with the exactsame number of body hairs there arecurrently more than seven billion peoplein the world that 's a lot of people buthow likely is it that two of them havethe exact same number of body hairswithout going through the process ofactually counting every hair on everyperson you might think the answer isprobabilistic like it 's 70 percentlikely or maybe even 99 percent butactually it 's a hundred percentguaranteed the answer is yesdefinitively yes how can I be soconfident about this the first step isto figure out how many body hairs aperson could possibly have if we figurethat somebody is covered head-to-toewith dense hair what 's the maximumnumber of hairs they could havefortunately for us this wonderful bookcalled the heart of mathematics actuallycalculates that the author starts byexamining his own head and finds outthat he has 1,600 hairs per square inchhe figures nobody can have more than 10times that much 16,000 hairs per squareinchthis is definitely an over estimate youcan try to draw 16,000 teeny tiny dotsin a 1 inch by 1 inch square it 's notreally possible but that 's ok we'relooking to overestimate the number ofhairs on a human body now we need toknow how much skin a human could havethe book uses a cylinder as a model ofthe human body easily calculating thatthe author has less than 2,500 squareinches of skin then he concludes nobodycould have more than 10 times this25,000 square inches of skin if weassume that all of the skin is coveredin the maximum number of hairs therewould be 25,000 times 16,000 hairs whichequals 400 million all of these overestimates lead us to the conclusion thatthere 's absolutely no way a person hasmore than 400 million hairs on theirbody back to the question are there twopeople in the world with the exact samenumber of body hairs there must bebecause there are more people on earth7.3 billion then there are possiblenumber of body hairs 400 million here'sa great way to think about it also fromthe books the heart of mathematicsimagine there are 400 million rooms eachnumbered 1 through 400 million everyperson on earth has to stand in the roomthat represents how many body hairs thatperson has it 's not possible foreveryone to stand in a different roomthere simply are n't enough rooms someroom has to have multiple people in itand those people have the exact samenumber of body hairs the method that weuse to answer that big hairy questionwas surprisingly simple mathematicianscall it the pigeonhole principle becauseif you want to put 12 pigeons in 10holes some of the pigeons have to sharea hole that 's it but that 's the wholeidealet 's phrase it as a more generalmathematical principle if I 'm splittingthings into categories and I have morethings than categories then some of thethings must be in the same categorysometimes people find the pigeonholeprinciple frustrating it does n't tellyou which pigeons share which holebut it 's still capable of proving someamazing facts despite its simplicitythis idea of using the pigeonholeprinciple to prove silly things abouthuman hair is pretty old way back in1692 it shows us in the Athenian mercuryan old British magazine that sometimescalled the world 's first advice columnin it regular people could ask fancypeople questions like philosophers saythere 's no motion how can that be or isit possible my neighbor is a vampiresomeone also wrote in to ask whetherthere are any two persons in the worldthat have an equal number of hairs ontheir head then the fancy person fromthe magazine responds that there aremore men in the world than hairs uponany man 's head is very certain and sotis demonstratable there are an equalnumber of hairs on two people and thenit goes on to give a convolutedexplanation of the pigeonhole principlethat 's cute null but what 's the point ofthis whole pigeonhole principle thingcan it help with anything besides athree century long discussion of bodyhair yes definitely this simple idea canbe applied to so many thingscheck out these modern examples ifyou 're in an elevator with three otherpeople and there are five buttons lit upthen the pigeonhole principle says thatsome prankster press the buttons formultiple floors another example thereare only ten thousand possible pins foryour debit card so in a college of 10001students at least two of them have thesame pin we could make up these sillyexamples all dayin fact I encourage you to try just thatbut at this point you might be wonderingif the pigeonhole principle is actuallyused in serious mathematics it is thisguy is credited as the first person towrite down the pigeonhole principle informal mathematicshe used it to prove this theorem sowhile the pigeonhole principle seemstotally obvious when you 're talkingabout pigeons and poles it can provelots of mathematical statements that arecompletely not obvious here 's anotherexample of a tricky math problem thatrequires the pigeonhole principle tosolve take a sphere in three-dimensionalspace and draw five dots on it anywhereyou want then here 's a weird fact we canalways draw a closed hemisphere thatcontains at least four of the dots let'sgive a proof of this fact that uses thepigeonhole principle first pick yourfavorite two dots then we can draw acircle going through those two pointsthat goes all the way around the spherelike the equator does it 's called agreat circle and it cuts the sphere intotwo hemispheres or equal halves two ofthe five points are on this circle so wehave three points left the pigeonholeprinciple says that one half of thesphere as divided by our great circlemust contain at least two of the pointsso draw the hemisphere to fill that sidethat closed hemisphere contains fourpoints the awesomely simple pigeonholeprinciple just helped us prove a reallycool math fact but now I 'm going tointroduce you to a more complex versionof the pigeonhole principle using thebasic version we know that if threegoals have been scored in a soccer gamethen some team has scored at least twopoints but if five goals have beenscored then some team has scored atleast three points that 's a morepowerful version of the pigeonholeprinciple it says that if we have K manycategories and end things there must beat least n divided by K things in somecategory if six teams are playing in asoccer tournament and twenty-eight goalshave been scored in the tournament thensome team must have scored at least fivegoals 28 divided by six is four andthree-quarters but if you 've scored atleast four and three-quarters goals thenyou 've scored five goals here 's anotherexample there are only 366possible birthdays and eight and a halfmillion people in New York City thatmeans that there is some day of the yearwhen at least twenty 3225 New Yorkersare simultaneously celebrating theirbirthdayusing this beefed up version of thepigeonhole principle we can revise ouranswer to the original question arethere two people on earth with the exactsame number of body hairs since we'refitting 7.3 billion people into 400million categories there must be somecategory with at least 7.3 billiondivided by 400 million people in it thatmeans that there are at least 19 peoplewho all have the exact same number ofbody hairs they could form a club untilsomebody loses or grows a hair then theyget kicked out what 's the wildestapplication of the pigeonhole principleyou can come up with share it in thecomments and I 'll see you next week oninfinite series [ Music ] How Many Humans Have the Same Number of Body
