music first learned theorem sum square two shorter sides right triangle always equal square hypotenuse guessing came pretty familiar example like triangle triangle think easy take even exist example sum two perfect square happen perfect square keep mind comparison change exponent whole number bigger go many integer solution solution whatsoever famous last theorem theres special name triplet whole squared plus b squared equal c squared cal led triple going find every single possible example moreover well way visualize triple fit together old question pretty much old come math clay tablet b c millennium list triple way talking theorem would shame share favorite proof anyone already seen start drawing square side triangle take c square add four original triangle around get big square whose side length plus b also arrange square b square together four original triangle get big square whose side length plus b mean negative space diagram area big square minus times area triangle one perspective clearly squared plus b squared another perspective c squared anyway back question finding whole number solution start framing question slightly among point plane integer lattice point cross whole number distance away origin example point distance away origin point distance away origin question finding triple completely equivalent finding lattice point whole number distance away origin course point like distance origin whole number least square root whole number case squared plus squared distance hypotenuse square root taking might seem like strange step one justify moment think complex plane every one point like actually individual complex number case plus give surprisingly simple way modify get new point whose distance away origin guarantee whole number square algebraically square complex number expanding product matching like term everything involve multiplying integer component result guarantee integer case get plus also think complex multiplication geometrically take line drawn origin number consider angle make horizontal axis well length case square root effect multiplying anything complex number rotate angle stretch factor equal length multiply number effect double angle importantly square length since length star ted square root whole number resulting length guarantee whole number case five let try another example start complex number integer like plus case distance number origin square root squared plus squared square root multiply complex number real part comes squared plus squared minus imaginary part times plus times result plus magnitude new number square magnitude starting number plus simply squaring randomly chosen lattice point give us triangle theres something kind magical actually watching work almost like cheating start randomly chosen lattice point like plus taking square generate triple case plus squared plus distance away origin play around encourage find result kind boring starting point one triple end going include example plus squared give even though technically indeed lattice point whole number distance away origin triple correspond squared plus squared equal squared exactly something write home part method squaring complex surprisingly simple way generate non trivial triple even generalize get nice formula write initial point u v work u plus squared real part u squared minus v squared imaginary part times u v resulting distance origin going u squared plus v squared kind fun work expression algebraically see indeed check also fun plug random integer u v get triple essentially weve machine give pair integer give back triple really nice way visualize familiar watch zeta function video watch every point z plane move point z squared example point plus going move plus point going rotate degree square negative point negative going move every single point plane ill make colorful theyre easier follow look like grid get turned parabolic arc every point arc intersect place way lattice point landed correspond triple draw triangle whose hypotenuse line one point origin whose leg parallel axes three side length triangle whole love usually view triple seem completely random unconnected youd temp ted say theres pattern lot sitting together really organized sitting intersection nicely spaced curve might ask account every possible triple sadly example never get point six plus method even though perfectly valid triple simply integer u v u plus squared plus likewise never hit plus dont really feel like anything new since get one scaling familiar triple method fact ill explain shortly every possible triple miss multiple different triple hit give another example point plus integer u v u plus squared plus fact never hit point whose imaginary component odd however hit plus thats plus squared even though miss plus half times point hit way never scale anything smaller nice way think multiple miss take point get squaring method draw line origin point infinity marking lattice point line account multiple point might possible point account every possible triple every right triangle ever seen ever see whole number side length somewhere diagram see shift different view triple problem one involve finding point unit circle rational take expression squared plus b squared equal c squared divide c squared get c squared plus b c squared equal one give us point unit circle x squared plus squared equal one whose rational call rational point unit circle going way around find rational point unit circle multiply common denominator land point integer whose distance origin also integer mind consider diagram squared every possible lattice point drew radial one account multiple might project point onto unit circle one moving along corresponding radial line end whole bunch rational point circle keep mind way drawing finitely many dot drew infinitely many corresponding every possible squared lattice point would actually fill every single pix el screen method incomplete missing triple somewhere would mean theres rational point circle never hit project everything circle let show happen take one rational point draw line point negative one compute rise run slope line rise two point rational run also rational slope going rational number show method squaring complex count every possible rational slope going guarantee hit every possible rational point unit circle right well let think method start point u plus integer number make angle horizontal going call theta squaring number resulting angle horizontal times theta course project onto unit circle along radial line corresponding rational point unit circle also angle times theta ill bring nice little bit circle geometry time angle two point circumference circle center turns exactly times angle made point point circle circumference provided point original two point mean situation line negative rational point circle must make angle theta horizontal word line slope line origin initial complex number u plus v look rise run slope line defined choice integer u v slope v divided u course choose v u whatever integer want therefore indeed account every possible rational slope go radial method determined possible choice u v must pass every rational point circle mean method must hit every possible triple havent already watched video pie hi ding prime topic highly related also involve pretty surprising thing happen reframe problem lattice point term complex id say video pair particularly well one video sup ported part remix looking recruit soft ware particularly background math could potentially mean among remix make platform public transit mean offering product help find efficient cost effective ways serve demographic want provide already leap ahead many go problem theyre always pushing make thing better open door seriously interesting optimization problem position apply ing place like youd get work incredibly capable team tackling problem lie nicely intersection stuff matter stuff thats
