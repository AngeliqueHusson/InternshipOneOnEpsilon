What I want to do in this video is a fairly straightforwardprimer on perimeter and area.And I 'll do perimeter here on the left , and I 'll do area here on the right.And you 're probably pretty familiar with these concepts , but we 'll revisit it just in case you are not.Perimeter is essentially the distanceto go around something or if you wereto put a fence around something or if youwere to measure -- if you were to put a tape around a figure , howlong that tape would be.So for example , let's say I have a rectangle.And a rectangle is a figure that has 4 sides and 4 right angles.So this is a rectangle right here.I have 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 right angles.And it has 4 sides , and the opposite sidesare equal in length.So that side is going to be equal in length to that side , and that side is equal in length to that side.And maybe I 'll label the points A , B , C , and D.And let 's say we know the following.And we know that AB is equal to 7 , and we know that BC is equal to 5.And we want to know , what is the perimeter of ABCD ? So let me write it down.The perimeter of rectangle ABCD is justgoing to be equal to the sum of the lengths of the sides.If I were to build a fence , if this was like a plot of land , I would just have to measure -- howlong is this side right over here ? Well , we already know that 's 7 in this color.So it 's that side right over there is of length 7.So it 'll be 7 plus this length over here , which is going to be 5.They tell us that.BC is 5.Plus 5.Plus DC is going to be the same lengthis AB , which is going to be 7 again.So plus 7.And then finally , DA a or AD , however you want to call it , is going to be the same length as BC , which is 5 again.So plus 5 again.So you have 7 plus 5 is 12 plus 7 plus 5 is 12 again.So you 're going to have a perimeter of 24.And you could go the other way around.Let 's say that you have a square , whichis a special case of a rectangle.A square has 4 sides and 4 right angles , and all of the sidesare equal.So let me draw a square here.My best attempt.So this is A , B , C , D. And we 're going to tell ourselvesthat this right here is a square.And let 's say that this square has a perimeter.So square has a perimeter of 36.So given that , what is the length of each of the sides ? Well , all the sides are going to have the same length.Let 's call them x.If AB is x , then BC is x , then DC is x , and AD is x.All of the sides are congruent.All of these segments are congruent.They all have the same measure , and we call that x.So if we want to figure out the perimeter here , it 'll just be x plus x plus x plus x , or 4x.Let me write that . x plus x plus x plus x , which is equal to 4x , which is going to be equal to 36.They gave us that in the problem.And to solve this , 4 times something is 36 , you could solve that probably in your head.But we could divide both sides by 4 , and you get x is equal to 9.So this is a 9 by 9 square.This width is 9.This is 9 , and then the height right over here is also 9.So that is perimeter.Area is kind of a measure of how much spacedoes this thing take up in two dimensions ? And one way to think about area is if I have a 1-by-1 square , so this is a 1-by-1 square -- and when I say 1-by-1 , it means you only have to specify two dimensionsfor a square or a rectangle because the other two aregoing to be the same.So for example , you could call this a 5 by 7 rectanglebecause that immediately tells you , OK , this side is 5and that side is 5.This side is 7 , and that side is 7.And for a square , you could say it 's a 1-by-1 squarebecause that specifies all of the sides.You could really say , for a square , a squarewhere on one side is 1 , then really all the sidesare going to be 1.So this is a 1-by-1 square.And so you can view the area of any figureas how many 1-by-1 squares can you fit on that figure ? So for example , if we were going back to this rectangle righthere , and I wanted to find out the area of this rectangle -- and the notation we can use for areais put something in brackets.So the area of rectangle ABCD is equal to the numberof 1-by-1 squares we can fit on this rectangle.So let 's try to do that just manually.I think you already might get a sense of howto do it a little bit quicker.But let 's put a bunch of 1-by-1.So let 's see.We have 5 1-by-1 squares this way and 7 this way.So I 'm going to try my best to draw it neatly.So that 's 1 , 3 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , and then 7.1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7.So going along one of the sides , if we just go alongone of the sides like this , you could put 7 justalong one side just like that.And then over here , how many can we see ? We see that 's 1 row.And that 's 2 rows.Then we have 3 rows and then 4 rows and then 5 rows.1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5.And that makes sense because this is 1 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 1.Should add up to 5.These are 1 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 1.Should add up to 7.Yup , there 's 7.So this is 5 by 7.And then you could actually count these , and this is kind of straight forward multiplication.If you want to know the total number of cubes here , you could count it , or you can say , well , I 've got 5 rows,7 columns.I 'm going to have 35 -- did I say cube -- squares.I have 5 squares in this direction , 7 in this direction.So I 'm going to have 35 total squares.So the area of this figure right over here is 35.And so the general method , you could justsay , well , I 'm just going to take one of the dimensionsand multiply it by the other dimension.So if I have a rectangle , let 's saythe rectangle is 1/2 by 1/2 by 2.Those are its dimensions.Well , you could just multiply it.You say 1/2 times 2.The area here is going to be 1.And you might say , well , what does 1/2 mean ? Well , it means , in this dimension , I could only fit 1/2 of a 1-by-1 square.So if I wanted to do the whole 1-by-1 square , it 's all distorted here.It would look like that.So I 'm only doing half of one.I 'm doing another half of one just like that.And so when you add this guy and this guy together , you are going to get a whole one.Now what about area of a square ? Well , a square is just a special casewhere the length and the width are the same.So if I have a square -- let me draw a square here.And let 's call that XYZ -- I do n't know , let 's make this S.And let 's say I wanted to find the areaand let 's say I know one side over here is 2.So XS is equal to 2 , and I want to find the area of XYZS.So once again , I use the bracketsto specify the area of this figure , of this polygon righthere , this square.And we know it 's a square.We know all the sides are equal.Well , it 's a special case of a rectangle wherewe would multiply the length times the width.We know that they're the same thing.If this is 2 , then this is going to be 2.So you just multiply 2 times 2.Or if you want to think of it , yousquare it , which is where the word comesfrom -- squaring something.So you multiply 2 times 2 , which is equal to 2 squared.That 's where the word comes from , finding the area of a square , which is equal to 4.And you could see that you could easilyfit 4 1-by-1 squares on this 2-by-2 square . test
