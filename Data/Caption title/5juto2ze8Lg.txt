In this video , we¡¯re gon na to learn the basics about how to add fractions.Now a lot of math books will teach you how to add fractions before they teach you how to multiply them , but here at Math Antics , we think you should learn the other way around.You remember how easy it is to multiply fractions , right ? You just multiply the top numbers together , and you multiply the bottom numbers together , and you have your answer.So , you might be wondering , ¡°Well¡­ can¡¯t we just do that with addition too ? ¡±¡°Can¡¯t we just add the top numbers together and add the bottoms together and get our answer ? ¡±Well alright , let¡¯s try it and see¡­ . but I¡¯ve got a bad feeling about this ! Let¡¯s try adding 1/2 to 1/2So if we added the top numbers , we¡¯d get 2And if we added the bottom numbers , we¡¯d get 4But¡­ well that can¡¯t be right ! , because 2 over 4 simplifies to one-half.And if you add one-half and one-half , you should get a whole ¡­not a half ! [ Alarm sound ] Uh Oh ! We must have broke some sort of math rule ! I¡¯m outta here ! ! Okay , here¡¯s what we did wrong.It turns out that there¡¯s some important math rules called ¡®Order of Operations¡¯that say you have to do multiplication and division BEFORE you do addition and subtraction.Now because fractions are just division problems , if you just added the top numbers and added the bottom numbers , you 'd be breaking those rules because you¡¯d be doing the addition before the division.So , what are we gon na do instead ? Well fortunately , there¡¯s a trick that lets us work around the Order of Operations rules and add fractions without dividing.But there¡¯s a catch . It only works for fractions that have the same bottom numbers.The trick is , if fractions have the same bottom numbers , we can add them by just adding the top numbers together and keeping the same bottom number in our answer.For example , to add one-half and one-half , we just add the top numbers ; and 1 and 1 gives us 2.But we DON¡¯T add the bottom numbers . We just use the same bottom number in the answer , which is 2.So , 2 over 2 is a whole fraction . And that makes sense because if you add one-half and one-half , you get a whole ! Let¡¯s see a few more examples . ¡­like this one : 5 over 16 plus 2 over 16.Again , since the bottom numbers are the same , it¡¯s easy to add these fractions.All we do is add the top numbers together : 5 plus 2 equals 7 , and that¡¯s the top number of our answer.Then we just keep 16 as the bottom number of our answer.So , 5 over 16 , plus 2 over 16 , equals 7 over 16 . Pretty easy , huh ? But what about subtracting fractions ? Does that work the same way ? Yep , if the bottoms numbers are the same , all you have to do is subtract the top numbers and keep the same bottom number in your answer.Here¡¯s an example of subtracting fractions with the same bottom numbers : 5 over 9 minus 2 over 9.First we subtract the top numbers : 5 minus 2 equals 3.Then we just write the same bottom number in our answer : 9So , 5 over 9 , minus 2 over 9 , is 3 over 9.Yep , adding and subtracting fractions with the same bottom numbers is easy.And there¡¯s a special name for problems like this . It¡¯s called ¡°Adding or Subtracting ¡®Like¡¯ Fractions.¡±A teacher once told me that they¡¯re called ¡®like¡¯ fractions because the bottom numbers are the same , ( or ¡®alike¡¯ ) but I think it¡¯s because they secretly like each other.Just kidding . But seriously , ¡®like¡¯ fractions are easy to add with the trick we just learned , but what happens if you want to add two ¡®unlike¡¯ fractions ? What do you do if you have fractions with DIFFERENT bottom numbers ? Unfortunately , the only way we can add ¡®unlike¡¯ fractions without doing the division first , is to change them so that they DO have the same bottom numbers.In other words , we need to change our ¡®unlike¡¯ fractions into ¡®like¡¯ fractions so we can just use our trick.In math language , that¡¯s called ¡°finding a common denominator¡±.Now remember that a ¡®denominator¡¯ is just a fancy math word for the bottom number of a fraction.And ¡®common¡¯ just means that they¡¯re the same.So , how do we find a common denominator so that we can add or subtract ¡®unlike¡¯ fractions ? That¡¯s what we¡¯re gon na learn in the next video.But before you move on , be sure to do the exercises for this section.Learn more at www.mathantics.com Math Antics - Adding and Subtracting Fractions Math Antics - Adding and Subtracting Fractions Math Antics - Adding and Subtracting Fractions
