ked talk little bit new innovation voting system id like tell voting buzz word academic describe mean really verify whole flow information head think want vote way casting vote tabulation final tally verify every step way going way vote count way intended final result accurate representation everybody vote sand right many voting certain amount verifiability lovely thing paper ballot sis see know wrote intended thats important property nice youve cast paper ballot trusting chain custody paper make sure count done right right talk self ie thing people like take photo ballot dont yeah lot fun think may increase voter participation little fun like ballot booth thing worrisome though security point view know self ie casting ballot sell ballot thats one thing weve learned hard way many many decade sis dont want enable people sell shouldnt leave voting booth kind proof shouldnt receipt saying vote way shouldnt copy ballot shouldnt anything prove worth know buck know guy bar want know buy vote maybe coerce yeah possibly know vote way hard question make fascinating research area turns thread needle bit care bit cryptography bit mathematics idea would get receipt vote receipt plain text encryption vote something cant sell something thats interpretable somebody like number bar code number bar code something like represent get receipt new thing verifiable system sis receipts get posted web say brad receipt r r ons receipt forth everybody name receipts get posted nobody tell anybody else vote cant sell vote based posting anybody look look see got receipt right receipt encryption vote right thats key thing know vote pile know vote pile way think reason believe ill explain encryption vote actually everyone encryption look different encryption look different simple encryption deterministic way good point yeah everybody voting al ice dont look bob dont look theres couple one well verify tally somebody en crypted vote primarily al ice theres bob theres assertion election official made know convince anybody thats right like convince everybody thats right without showing everybody vote got pile en crypted vote announce result youd like know election official youd like convince everybody thats right result theres number ways theres quite large literature way thats pretty simple describe could use something cal led homomorphic encryption mean mean together end represent ing sum encryption one times encryption two give encryption three right end plain text multiply cipher text cool lots wonderful thing particular tally voting system example vote vote al ice might encryption one vote vote bob might encryption zero suppose al ice bob two ballot either one zero basically want add theyre dont see use homomorphic property multiply together end number represent sum sum number vote cast al ice right tally al ice sum thing bob number vote minus tally course al ice half multiply together get cipher text thats cipher text sum cipher text de crypted publicly way everybody see proper see yes everybody could also multiplication check thats cipher text election official could de crypt nice way show thats proper right tally thats one part need everybody verify tally en crypted thing sand thats cool right thats one part part want fact need know cipher text really represent ing vote right go voting booth getting receipt want know receipt really represent vote vote al ice get receipt cant de crypt cipher text fact shouldnt able de crypt could sell vote like could self ie right want know really say al ice voting thats little subtle maybe matchbox analogy bad way explain know youve got good match going trip take one match know youve got good match well could take box drawer say well maybe box good try randomly sampling match es light yeah one light one want take match havent tried yet maybe last match say well havent tried match box good going trust one good put pocket take something like encryption say walk voting get encryption first representation choice say al ice get encryption want see really good encryption like seeing good match ill strike ill ask machine since first place test see properly unfortunately cant use vote know well cant post could sell vote post one thats spoiled ballot cant use get taken tally taken even posted tally used anywheres like havent vote al lim testing voting machine many times like know two three times check different different thing see machine reliably say want vote say voting al ice test say voting bob test say voting al ice maybe dont test one say well go well post web youve got confidence like match es encryption done properly doesnt need done lot people right needs done enough know arent trying cheat large scale two part getting encryption trust even getting tally verify even though input tally encryption sand wonderful idea evolve year many different part together mean voting system thats verifiable way want vote end process casting ballot posting tally announcement result verify outcome right future might kind voting system everybody vote still research bit development jurisdiction starting use practice well see goes put another al ice pick one put back together copy got six cool drawn four two vote feat homomorphic encryption vote feat homomorphic encryption vote feat homomorphic encryption vote feat homomorphic encryption vote
