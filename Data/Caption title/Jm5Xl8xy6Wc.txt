welcome in this video like to address anissue from an algebra class but in onestudies quadratics that has equationsthe form y equals ax squared plus BXplus C one studies them to death and younotice these are you shaped curves arethe upward facing news or downwardfacing use and so forth and to make thisinteresting and exciting for kids thathave to say there 's a real worldapplication namely objects flyingthrough the air follow the samequadratic u-shaped curves example hadlikes a cannon firing a cannonball andnot very good drawing cannons here comesa cannonball it flies through the airfollowing some u-shaped curve and theyclaim that the u-shape Swan studying analgebra class precisely the ones you seein the real world with flying objectsthey usually say this without muchexplanation as to why you might want tobelieve that not every u-shaped curve inthe world is actually this precisely theyou of the quadratic socially there 's noreason to believe that they often saythat when you study calculus in you knowtwo three four years times then we'llgive you the reasons why this is true sojust for now believe us and just answerall these questions about legal arejumping off diving boards or poindexterthrowing a basketball or something letme in this video try to give anexplanation why my alto student want tobelieve that these quadratics one learnsan algebra class have anything to dowith the quadratics from the physicsclass these parabolas first of all Ishould point out it 's actually not truein the real world objects do n't followthese perfect parabolic arcs as thingslike air resistance and the Corioliseffect as the turning of the earth haseffects on things alright maybe in theideal world there 's this connection somy job today is try to understand try toexplain at the level of an ultra classwhy might want to believe that theseformulas really do the match theformulas one sees in physics here goesto do that I have to use the theories ofdifference methods which sounds awfullyscary but it 's actually a very fun andvery accessible and great topic in factyou should go to chapter 18 of thevolume to my mathematics serious let'sgo to em Lulu com lu lu calm you betterpick up my manbook their chapter ATM cells like it'shigh in the book was actually this isall cool accessible fun stuff I do thiskids all the time but let me just do itwas sort of a simple version of what'sgoing on in that chapter there does itstalk about sequence for a moment andjust play with them now some sequencesare pretty easy example if I startedwriting on the on screen five eight 1114 17 20 you 're probably detecting apattern and we 'd like to believe thispatterns true it 's know reasonablypatterns true but if you head make aguess what the next number is going tobe you 'll probably save 23 and let mejust guess what was actually goingthrough on any in mind you probablyworked out the first difference that thenumber from three to five to threethat 's up five to eight is up by threegoing from 8-11 supper three up by threeby three up by three so certainly onthis line of differences you see there'sdefinitely a pattern which we think isgoing to keep happening the next ifthat 's going to be three excuse meactually mission that means the nexttime is gon na be 23 then up another 326and so on alright so sequences of thisproperty that their differences or whatI 'm going to call their first differenceis the first time a difference is thefirst row of differences sequels werethe problem that the first differencesare constant are called linear sequencesand the word linear makes sense becauseactually if us to draw a picture thisdata five eight 11 14 so forth or to itsfollowers the first data values for labunits hi okay one step over the nextdata value is eight units hi next arethe values 11 units high and then 14units high and so on it appears thatthese dots will occur in a straight lineand that actually makes sense if Ireally just pause for a moment those Idid the first data value is five andthen one unit over to the next spot theconstant difference was three means haveto go three values up to get to add thenext out of value of eight I went oneyear over to the next data point thatwent up by three to eleven you wouldwant to over to the next data value theywent up by three to 14 so it is therereally are lying on a line of constantslope of 3 hence your linear picture hasthe name linear for sequences with thisproperty of first differences beingbut of course not all sequences aregoing to be linear like that not thateasy and nice so let 's do a moreinteresting example let 's look at thesequence so as I clear my screen get apen let 's look at the sequence 2 3 611-18 27 38 and so on all right let'scheck their first differences is itconstant up by one up by 3 x 5 x 7 nodefinite costs by 9i balancers notlinear as you i see a pattern in thisthese first differences but let 's justpretend a little slow and i did n't seewhat was going with these green numbersi want to do the differences againthere 's a lot to do the seconddifferences 1 2 3 is up by 2 325 is upby two up by two by two upper two surelyby now see the pattern so these seconddifferences are constant to seconddifferences and I 've only guess that thenext second difference is going to be 2which means the next time after Elevenshave to be up by 2 is 13 so it tells me38 changes by 13 become 51 and so onalright so people give a very suggestivename to sequences whose seconddifferences are constant they call themquadratic sequences now just because Icall them quadratic does n't mean theyhave anything to actually do withquadratics though you 'd probably guessthey do why would something give themthat name in any case but for right nowwe have no reason to see there 's anyconnection between quadratic equationsand sequences with second emphasis beingconstant so what I need you to do isquickly explore that let 's let 's explorethat issue our quadratic sequencesreally connected to quadratic formulasthat is annoying having the same wordhere all right but he goes just playwith that let me do the most simplequadratic formula think up to somethinglike n squared that is definitelyquadratic I 'm guess I 'm using n ratherthan X is something he and his numberhere let me start with 0 I like workingwith zero because is easy to plug intoformula so 0 squared is 0 1 squared is 12 squared is 4 3 squared is 9 4 square 216 25 36 and so forth so that gives methat sequence 01 49 16 is that aquadratic sequence in the sense that itssecond difference is constant well let'scheck 021 up by 11 24 up by 3 by 5 7 911 I guess the first differences secondit was I think we 've been here before usup by two every single time yep thissequence that comes from a very simplequadratic formula does dessert we calledquadratic sequence in the sense thatsecond differences the constant allright let 's try a little morecomplicated nasty model if I made itlike a really horrible quadratic formula2 N squared minus 3 and plus 1 that'sdefinite quadratic formula does it yielda sequence that deserves to be quadraticin the census second difference is aconstant all right I 'm having a hardtime plugging numbers here so I'mverified with zero putting 0 that formgives me one plug in 1 2-3 plus 1 is 0plug into 2 x 4 's 8-6 3 plug in 3 2times 9 18 minus r 9 plus 1 is 10 pluginfor two times a 16-12 plus 1 is a 20 21plug in 501 box again he bored two times25 is 50-50 is 45 40 35 + 1 is 36 and soon all right does that give me asequence of constant second differencesall right let 's see going from 120that 's up by negative 1 foot weird gofrom 0 to 3 is up by three go from threeto ten is up by 7 10 to 11 the 21s up by11 21 of this is up by 15 oh it 's notlinear first difference is not constantbut the second differences are goingnegative 1 2 3 is up by four three twosevens up by four up by four up by fourbrilliant yes second differences areconstant so this deserves to be calledquadratic in the sense of sequences soyes this quadratic formula gave aquadratic sequence all right hold on tothis one I 'm going to come back to itbecause when you do offensive see if I'msqueeze and make my poor techniqueparticularly bad and messyI 'm going to do the most generalquadratic formula I can think of andlet 's check that it really is quadraticin it gives a quadratic sequence let'sbe really abstract and it 's going to benot very fun but let 's just do it a Nsquared plus BN plus C there is the mostgeneral quadratic formula there is allright what sequence does give or put anN equals zero glad and start with zerosor is easy gives me see put n equals 1gives me 1 a plus 1 B plus C so it givesme a plus B plus C put an N equals 2 fora plus 2 B plus C put an N equals 3 9 aplus 3 B plus C but in equals 4 16 aplus 4 B plus C and I 'll stop there ifyou keep going alright so the mostgeneral quadratic formula gives me thismost general sequence there is does ithave second differences being constantlet 's check all right going from seed aplus B plus C that 's up by a plus B thisis very abstract blank still holding ongoing from A plus b2 c2 forays those 2b 's and c 's i get a change of three acesup by 3 a 's b goes to visit sup by B andseized staying sees no chances to gofrom four eight and nine a that 's up by5 a 's from to be 23 bases up by B andreceive sees no change nine eight issixteen A 's up by seven as3 a ps2 forbees up by b/c see no change but there'sthis first differences here come thesecond differences a plus B goes to 3aplus be no change in the bees is only upby 2a 3a plus speed 25 a plus B that'sup by two a 5a plus B seven a plus B isup by 2a in fact if I kept growing I cansee yes the second differences areconstant brilliant so the most generalquadratic formula does indeed alwaysgive me a quadratic sequence second ifit is a constant but here 's thewonderful thing it ca n't approves theconverse reverse look at thisif I get a table I start with somesequence I get a table who 's seconddifference it 's a constant this issuggesting I should call this numberhere that I see in the third line twicea and this number here in the secondline a plus B and this very first numbershould call it C because that will thengive me a formula like this that formulawill give me the same beginning here andactually I can see that once I 've gotthe beginning of a table the whole restof the tables have to follow suit thatmeans this the what by calling thesenumbers to a a plus B and C I 'm gonnaget a formula that must match theoriginal sequence of numbers for examplelet 's do with these uploaded below hereis the beginning of my three differenttables what we 're learning here is Ishould call this to a that tells me ashould be to look a is to this numberhere is a plus B now I 've just said thata was too so tell me is two plus B isnegative one that tells me be better benegative 3 and look B is negative 3 andthis first first number here is si sibaby one and look see is one so thesefirst three numbers of this differencetable let me construct a formula for thesequence if indeed the game stops withthe constant numbers at the end herethis formula is going to be a quadraticformula and as we 're going to give methe whole sequence in fact we don'tbelieve me if all I gave you is thefirst three numbers I know everythingabout my table from now on because is upby four times me that better be a 3 isup by negative 1 that better be a zerothis is up by four cells me that 's aseven this is up by three tells me thattwo three this is up by seven as a 10once I 've got the first three numbers Iknow how the rest the table works so ifi can get the quadratic formula to matchthe first three numbers and I 've justcovered the recipe how to that means thewhole table is going to work that meansmy sequence must have come from aquadratic formulaso we have it there 's the big result Ineed to explain what Galileo did to talkabout objects flying through the air ifyou have a table of values whose secondderivatives are constant then that tablevalues must come from a quadraticformula all right let me explain indetail what really is going on in hisletters Galileo wrote about doingexperiment now there 's no evidence heactually does experiment at least wroteabout it that is if he thought about ifhe took went to the Leaning Tower ofPisa and dropped objects of differentmasses from that table that all falldown with the same rate of accelerationthat he proposed other by thought or byexperiment that all objects fliesthrough the air with constantacceleration that is his premise aboutobjects in the airnow we will explain what we mean byacceleration acceleration is rate ofchange of velocity and what doesvelocity is rate of change of positionin this case would be in the height ofthe objects they fall down so he'sclaiming that acceleration which isthere like the changes of velocity andvelocity is the changes of positionaccelerations like a double differenceconstant acceleration is like havingthis is not my real arguments likehaving constant double differences therefor the position should be followingsome sort of quadratic formula now letme really try to pin this down a littlemore carefully because there is actuallycalculus at the base of this and I wantto really pin highlight what thatcalculus argument is whether where thetricky part is it 's even hard to knowwhat i mean by acceleration to beginwith i actually think about theseconcepts they 're very hard accelerationshard even talk about velocity what imean by velocity that 's hard as well isthe rate of change of position but if Ithink about that that 's confusing so forexample it 's less Alyssa spoken orvelocity for a moment but as I wastraveling along and I work at thevelocity my car then as I work out myvelocity at some time he 's bought zeroand the work at my velocity one minutelater how would I do that well I 've missmeasure my position at time zero callthat position at time zero and measuremy position at time one of call that p1then velocity is going to be theHellfire move the change of positionover the time interval I used one minuteso I 'd get that number of miles perminute all right that 's great maybe itgives me a number like 55 miles like onemile per minute or 55 miles 60 miles perhour go get some number great but here'sthe confusing part what if I actuallywho said I had to do it over one minutethat way what if i decide to measure myvelocity twice over half a minute butget my velocity between ed position p athalf a minute and pisa what I velocitythere would at my velocity for these twovalleys position so I do p half minus p0over half a time interval and I 'll do p1 minus p f over half an interval i gettwo different numbers for my velocity Ohin that one minute interval and mostlikely those numbers are different infact things give me worse what if Imeasure my velocity 10 times over pointone of a minute to point to the minute2.3 of a minute and so on I bet i wouldget 10 different numbers for my velocityover that men at a time so when I say Iknow what my velocity is I don'tactually know what I 'm talking about Ohwhat time int ' l are measuring this stuffif is it a really fine time intervalsare the course time interval anddepending on which time interval did Imight get different numbers very hard infact that 's the calculus part of whatthis is about how do n't even know whatvelocity means to begin with so that'sthat 's where catalyst comes in what isvelocity even mean however at thisalgebra level I could say if someonetold me my velocity was constant at 55miles per hour cosmic velocity probablymeans least to me that no matter how Imeasure it if I measure between zero andone I should get the arts 55 miles perhour if I measured between zero and ahalf or half and one each of those UV 55miles per hour if I measure betweenpoint2 and point three it should be 55miles from around so maybe when I sayvelocity is constant what I mean by thatis no matter how I work out velocityI 'll get the same number 55 miles perhour every single time so in that sensewhat made what Galileo meant if someonetold them that acceleration is constantno matter how I work out theacceleration I should get the samenumber every single time in fact vs saythat that number is negative 32 feet persecond squared every single timenegative quizzes like gravity 's pullingus down loads of going to the downwarddirection all right so in that sense nowthis is the skipped over the catalystpiece what I mean by constant severalshe probably means about how I workacceleration I should get the samenumber every single time calculus piecesays what I even really mean byacceleration was it mean to be constantbut on some level I 'm there because thisis telling me suppose I actually did anexperiment I threw an object out of theair and I recorded its height atdifferent times time T equals one secondzero seconds two equals one second I'llget some data and maybe the data issomething like the followingyou know I first of all I measure myobject is first ten feet high and that'sa 93 feet high that 's hundred forty fourfeet high and hundred sixty-three havefree high 150 feet diets I startedcoming down hundred five feet high if Idid this data Galileo says that I shouldget constant acceleration there 's nomatter how I work at this elevationshould get the same number every timewell to get acceleration these are justmy height some of these most positionsand I need my velocities well myvelocity from being it position ten toposition 93 that 's going up by 83 feetso there 's a change of 83 feet in onesecond this is going 83 feet per secondhere the bottom looks like it 's going upfrom 93 to 144 is going change in 51feet over one second is the velocity is51 feet per second here I 'll measure thevelocities so 19 19 feet velocitieslooks that 's going down now is that myboss is now negative 13 feet per secondand then a negative 45 feet per secondnow if I work at the acceleration if I'dlike to say the acceleration is constantI should get in the same number everytime and look acceleration is the rateof change of velocity again fromvelocity of 83 + 8 51 that 's down 32 /one second down 32 / one second down 32/ one second down 32 / one second voilaGalileo saying about how I work ataccelerations I 'm going to have somesort of table like this of data thatthese second differences are going to beconstant which means my original formulafor height must have been some kind ofquadratic formula that 's it so what Idid here I did some experiment where istanding because I start at ten feethigh so in orbit up in the air and cameback down again and its height followeda quadratic formula now that 's notseeing a u-shaped curve line for theyear but if I actually threw my objectsat a tilt its height will follow themfor me but it 's always constantly movingto the right so what I 'm going to startto see some formula like this there 's aquadratic but teased out and becauseit 's teased out I 'm now going to beseeing that actual you shape why is atimes T squared plus B times T plus Cokay so i 'll call it Tino 's i 'm thinkingthat really will be a chronic quadraticcurve so thanks to Galileo you know for500 years ago who made this amazing someof the verifications of observation thatacceleration due to gravity seems to beconstant at this level if I interpretconstant Musa man how a workoutaccelerations could be the same valuethat means any table of data I do forposition of an object flying for the airit 's gon na be a quadratic formula thatis what I 'm seeing my physics classreally is what I 'm seeing an algebraclass in ideal situations ignoring airresistance in turn of earth and wind andall sorts of stuff well that 's it so ifI were the teacher of an outer class Iwould definitely talk about all mydifference methods I shall do all thestuff that appears and chapter 80 inthis book it 's actually great stuff kidslove it lots of fun very accessible andeasy and this actually then gives agateway to actually give somejustification while the quadratics youstudy in algebra really are thequadratics you study in physics whythose things match up in the ideal worldat least if only i could rewrite theentire curriculum fabulous alrightthanks so much Why Thrown Objects follow Quadratic
