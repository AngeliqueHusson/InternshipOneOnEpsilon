welcome video like address algebra class quadratics form equal ax squared plus c one death notice shaped curve upward facing news downward facing use forth make interesting exciting say real world application namely object flying air follow quadratic u shaped curve example cannon firing cannon ball good drawing cannon cannon ball air following u shaped curve claim swan study ing algebra class precisely see real world flying usually say without much explanation might want every u shaped curve world actually precisely quadratic socially reason believe often say study calculus know two three four year times well give true believe us answer question legal diving board basketball something let video try give explanation alto student want quadratics one learn san algebra class anything quadratics physics class parabola first point actually true real world object n follow perfect parabolic arc air resistance turning earth thing alright maybe ideal world connection job today try understand try explain level ultra class might want believe really match one physics goes use difference method awfully scary actually fun accessible great topic fact go chapter volume mathematics serious em lulu c om l u l u calm better pick man book chapter cell like high book actually cool accessible fun stuff time let sort simple version whats going chapter sequence moment play sequence sare pretty easy example screen five eight probably detect ing pattern like believe true know true head make guess next number going tobe probably save let guess actually going mind probably worked first difference three five three five eight three going supper three three three three certainly line difference see theres definitely pattern think going keep happening next going three excuse actually mission mean next time gon na another alright sequence property difference going call first difference first time difference first row difference sequel problem first difference sare constant cal led linear sequence sand word linear make sense actually us draw picture data five eight forth first data value hi one step next data value eight hi next value high high appear dot occur straight line actually make sense pause moment first data value five one unit next spot constant difference three mean go three value get add next value eight went one year next data point went three eleven would want next data value went three really lying line constant slope hence linear picture name linear sequence property first difference course sequence going linear like nice let interesting example let look sequence clear screen get let look sequence right first difference constant one x x cost balancer linear see pattern first difference let pretend little slow n see going green number si want difference lot two two two upper two surely see pattern constant guess next second difference going mean next time eleven shave tell become alright people give suggestive name sequence whose constant call quadratic sequence call quadratic n mean anything actually quadratics though probably guess would something give name case right reason see connection quadratic equation sand sequence second emphasis constant need quickly explore let let explore issue quadratic connected quadratic annoying word right goes play let simple quadratic formula think n squared definitely quadratic guess n rather x something number let start like working zero easy plug formula squared squared squared squared square forth give sequence quadratic sequence sense second difference constant well guess first difference second think two every single time yep sequence comes simple quadratic formula dessert sequence sense second difference constant right let try little complicated nasty model made like really horrible quadratic n squared minus plus thats definite quadratic formula yield sequence deserve quadratic census second difference constant right hard time plugging zero one plug plus x plug minus r plus two times plus box two soon right give sequence constant second right let see going negative foot weird go three go three ten oh linear first difference constant second difference going negative four three four four four brilliant yes second difference constant deserve sense sequence quadratic formula gave quadratic sequence right hold one going come back offensive see make poor technique particularly bad messy going general quadratic formula think let check really quadratic give quadratic sequence really abstract going fun let n squared plus b n plus c general quadratic formula right sequence give put ann equal zero glad start easy give see put n equal plus b plus c plus b plus c put n equal fora plus b plus c put n equal plus b plus c equal plus b plus c stop keep going alright general quadratic formula give general sequence second difference constant let check right going seed plus b plus c plus b abstract blank still holding ongoing plus foray c get change three ace sup b goes visit sup b stay ing chance go four eight nine bases b receive change nine eight sixteen seven bees b c see change theres first difference come difference plus b goes change bees plus speed plus b two plus b seven plus b fact kept growing see yes second difference constant brilliant general quadratic formula indeed always give quadratic sequence second constant wonderful thing ca n approve converse reverse look get table start sequence get table second difference constant suggesting call number see third line twice number second line plus b first number call c give formula like formula give beginning actually see got beginning table whole tables follow suit calling plus b c formula must match original sequence example let loaded beginning three different tables learning call tell look number plus b said tell two plus b negative one tell better negative look b negative first first number si one look see one first three difference table let construct formula sequence indeed game constant end formula going quadratic formula going give whole sequence fact dont believe gave first three know everything table four times better negative better zero four cell three tell two three seven got first three know rest table works get quadratic formula match first three covered recipe mean table going work sequence must come quadratic formula big result need explain talk object flying air table value whose constant must come quadratic formula right let explain really going wrote experiment evidence actually experiment least wrote thought took went leaning tower drop ped object table fall rate acceleration propose thought experiment object air constant acceleration premise air explain mean acceleration acceleration rate change velocity velocity rate change position case would height object fall acceleration like velocity velocity like double difference constant acceleration like real argument constant double difference therefor position following sort quadratic formula let really try pin little carefully actually calculus base want really pin highlight calculus argument whether tricky part even hard know mean acceleration actually think hard acceleration shard even talk velocity mean velocity hard well rate change position think example less lyssa spoken velocity moment along work velocity car work velocity time bought zero work velocity one minute later would well miss measure position time zero call position time zero measure position time one call velocity going move change position time interval used one minute get number per minute right great maybe number like like one mile per minute per hour go get number great part actually said one minute way decide measure velocity twice half minute get velocity e position p half minute pi sa velocity would velocity position p half minus half time interval minus p f half interval get two different velocity one minute interval different fact thing give worse measure velocity times minute point minute bet would get different velocity men time say know velocity know talking oh time l measuring stuff really fine time interval sare course time interval depending time interval might get different hard fact calculus part n even know velocity mean begin thats catalyst comes velocity even mean however algebra level could say someone told velocity constant per hour cosmic velocity least matter measure measure zero get art per hour measured zero half one u v per hour measure point three around maybe say velocity constant mean matter work velocity get number per hour every single time sense made meant someone told acceleration constant matter work acceleration get every single time fact v say number negative fee squared every single time negative like gravity load going downward direction right sense skip ped catalyst piece mean constant several probably mean work acceleration get every single time calculus even really mean acceleration mean constant level telling suppose actually experiment threw object air corded height different times time equal one second zero second two equal one second ill get data maybe data something like following know first measure object first ten fee high fee high hundred forty high hundred sixty three free high fee diet hundred five fee high data say get constant acceleration matter work elevation get number every time well get acceleration height position sand need well velocity position ten position going change fee one second going fee per second bottom look like going going change one second velocity fee per second measure fee going boss negative fee per second negative fee per second work acceleration id like say acceleration constant get number every time look acceleration rate change velocity velocity one second one second one second one second saying work going sort table like data second difference going constant mean original formula height must kind quadratic formula experiment standing start ten fee thigh orbit air came back height quadratic formula seeing u shaped curve line actually threw object sat tilt height follow always constantly moving right going start see formula like quadratic tease tease going actual shape times squared plus b times plus call thinking really chronic quadratic curve thanks know year ago made amazing verification observation acceleration due gravity seem constant level interpret constant mu sa man could value mean table data position object flying gon na quadratic formula seeing physics class really seeing algebra class ideal situation turn earth wind sort stuff well teacher outer class would definitely talk difference method shall stuff appear chapter book actually great stuff lots fun accessible easy actually give actually give justification quadratics study algebra really quadratics study physics thing match ideal world least could rewrite entire curriculum fabulous alright thanks much thrown object follow quadratic path
