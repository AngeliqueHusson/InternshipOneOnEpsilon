welcome to my video on vectors andscalars what on earth are these thingswe call vectors and scalars well firstlet me introduce you to vectors a vectoris a quantity that has magnitude and ithas direction now when I saved magnitudemagnitude means the size of something sowith a vector quantity we know themagnitude or the size and we know thedirection it 's moving towards now let'stalk about scalars a scalar quantityonly has a magnitude so we know thesesize of a scalar quantity but we do notknow the direction this is because ascalar quantity only has a magnitude solet me show you some real-life examplesand I think this will all make a lotmore sense now for our first examplelet 's say we are going on a road tripand during this road trip you travel adistance of 300 miles now the directionin which we travel is not given to us wedo not know if we travel 300 miles northor south or to the right or to the leftthe direction is not given to us theonly thing that 's given to us is thedistance or the magnitude of how far wetraveled so therefore distance is ascalar quantity because it only has amagnitude and the direction is unknownbut let 's say for example the directionwas given to us so let 's say we traveled300 miles to the right this is what wecall displacement displacement is justanother way of saying distance but withdisplacement the direction in which theobject is moving must be given sobecause we know the directiondisplacement is a vector quantitydisplacement has a magnitude which inthis example is 300 miles anddisplacement also has direction which inthis example is to the right so I hopethis gives you a better ideaof why displacement is a vector quantityand why distance is a scalar quantitynow I want to go over as many differentexamples as possible and I think thebest way to do this would be listing allof the most common scalar quantities andthe most common vector quantities now inour first example we already establishedwhy distance is a scalar quantity andwhy displacement is the vector quantitybut now let 's list some more anothercommon a scalar quantity is speed if wesay a car is traveling at a speed of 50miles per hour then we do know themagnitude of how fast the car is goingbut we do not know the direction whichthe car is going so because we know themagnitude and we do n't know thedirection this is why speed is a scalarquantity but let 's say for example thatthe car is traveling 50 miles per hourto the north in this example we do knowthe magnitude of how fast it 's going andwe know the direction is going to thenorth this is what we call velocityvelocity is a vector quantity because wehave a magnitude and we have a directionnow some other common scalar quantitiesare time and temperature they both havemagnitude but they do not have adirection and some other common vectorquantities are acceleration force andchange in temperature all of these dohave magnitude and they also havedirection so I highly encourage you tothink about all of these units foryourself think do they just havemagnitude or do they also have directionand then you can figure out yourselfwhether each unit is a vector or ascalar test
