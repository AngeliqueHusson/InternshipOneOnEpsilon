so welcome to my video on convertingpercents into decimals and the onlything that we 're actually doing whenchanging a percent into a decimal iswe 're moving the decimal point two unitsto the left and this will make a lotmore sense once we get started with thisexample here we have 37 % and the firstthing I 'm going to do is rewrite thiswith a decimal point 37 % is certainlyequal to 37 point 0 percent and like Isaid before the only thing we need to dois move the decimal point two units tothe left so that 's what I 'm going to doright now I 'm going to take my decimalpoint I 'm going to move it over twounits and have to remove our decimalpoint we can erase our percent sign andafter we move our point two units to theleft instead of 37 it becomes pointthree seven zero and you should neverhave a trailing zero in your finalanswer point three seven zero is exactlythe same as 0.37 so now we convertedthirty-seven percent into a decimal andwe have a final answer of 0.3 7 and manypeople forget when going from percent todecimal or going from decimal to percenton whether to move the decimal point twounits to the right or two units to theleft and one way to check your answer isthat your decimal should always besmaller than your percent so notice wehave a decimal of 0.37 which iscertainly smaller than our percentagewhich is 37 so that is the basic idea ofhow to change percentages into decimalsso here are some more videos with moreexample problems related to the videoyou just watched I really hope you arefinding my tutorials helpful so until mynext video I will see you lateryou Percent to Decimal Percent to Decimal Percent to Decimal
