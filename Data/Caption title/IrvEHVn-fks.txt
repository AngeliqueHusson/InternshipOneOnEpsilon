How many ounces are in 6 pounds ? So we have 6 pounds and we need toconvert them to ounces.And if you do n't know it already , you 'll know it now , that there are 16 ounces per pound.So what we want to do is we want to have pounds in thedenominator.It 's in the numerator right now.So we want to divide by pounds and multiply by ounces.Maybe I 'll write it out.And I just told you that there are 16ounces for every 1 pound.So if we multiplied these two expressions , this pounds willcancel with that pounds , and we 'll just be left with theunit of ounces , which is what we want , and we just multiply6 times 16.So it works out unit-wise , and it makes sense as well.If we have 16 ounces per pound , and we have 6 pounds , we just have to multiply 6 times 16.That 'll be the total number of ounces we have . So this isgoing to be equal to -- what 's 6 times 16 ? So if you take 16 times 6 , 6 times 6 is 36.Carry the 3.6 times 1 is 6 , plus 3 is 9.So 6 times 16 is 96.You have this divided by 1 here , but that 's not going tochange anything.And then all we're left with in thedimensions are the ounces.So 6 pounds are 96 ounces .
