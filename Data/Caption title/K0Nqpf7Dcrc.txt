to estimate the product of 8,000 291times 27 we first round so that eachnumber contains only one non-zero digitso here we round 8,000 291 to thenearest thousand and we round 27 to thenearest ten to round 8,000 291 to thenearest thousand the two to the right ofthe rounding place tells us to rounddown so 8,000 291 rounds down to 8,000to round 27 to the nearest ten theseventh to the right of the roundingplace tells us to round up so 27 roundsup to 30 so we have 8,000 times 30 nextwe line up the rounded numbers with thelarger number on top and multiply 8,000times 30 an easy way to multiply numbersthat end with zeros is to first countthe total number of zeros at the end ofthe numbers in this case we have threezeros at the end of eight thousand andone zero at the end of 30 since we havea total of four zeros at the end of thenumbers our answer will end with fourzeros next we multiply the nonzerodigits in this case that 's eight timesthree which is 24 so we put 24 in frontof the four zeros in our answer and wehave 240 thousand so 8,000 times 30 is240 thousand which means that eightthousand 291 times 27 is approximately240,000 test
