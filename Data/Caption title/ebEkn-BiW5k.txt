We often evaluate the success of medical treatments or social programs by how much of the population they help . Like , suppose we 're treating a disease that afflicts both people and cats , and among 1 cat and 4 people we treat , the cat and 1 person recover and 3 people die . And of 4 cats and 1 person we do n't treat , three of the cats recover while the person and 1 cat die . In the real world , these numbers might be more like 300 and 100 , or whatever , but we 'll keep them small so they 're easier to keep track of . So , in our sample , 100 % of treated cats survive while only 75 % of untreated cats do , and 25 % of treated humans survive while 0 % of untreated humans do . Which makes it seem like the treatment improves chances of recovery . Except that if we aggregate the data , among all people and cats treated , only 40 % survive , while among all people and cats left on their own , 60 % recover . Which makes it seem like the treatment reduces chances of recovery . So which is it ? This is an illustration of Simpson 's paradox , a statistical paradox where it 's possible to draw two opposite conclusions from the same data depending on how you divide things up , and statistics alone can not help us solve it â€ “ Â we have to go outside statistics and understand the causality involved in the situation at hand . For example , if we know that humans get the disease more seriously and are therefore more likely to be prescribed treatment , then it can make sense that fewer individuals that get treated survive , even if the treatment increases the chances of recovery , since the individuals that got treated were more likely to die in the first place . On the other hand , if we know that humans , regardless of how sick they are , are more likely to get treated than cats because no one wants to pay for kitty healthcare , then the fact that 4 out of 5 humans died while only 1 in 5 cats died suggests that , indeed , the treatment may be a bad choice . So if you 're doing a controlled experiment , you need to make sure to not let anything causally related to the experiment influence how you apply your treatments , and if you have an uncontrolled experiment , you have to be able to take those outside biases into account . As a more tangible example , Wisconsin has repeatedly had higher overall 8th grade standardized test scores than Texas , so you might think Wisconsin is doing a better job teaching than Texas . However , when broken down by race â€ “ Â which , via entrenched socioeconomic differences is a major factor in standardized-test scores â€ “ Texas students performed better than Wisconsin students on all fronts : black Texas students scored higher than black Wisconsin students , and likewise with hispanic and white students . The difference in the overall ranking is because Wisconsin has proportionally far fewer black and hispanic students and proportionally more white students than Texas â€ “ so the takeaway should not be that Wisconsin has better education than Texas ! Just that it has ( proportionally ) more socioeconomically advantaged people . In some situations there 's also a nice graphical way to picture Simpson 's paradox : as two separate trends that each go one way , but the overall trend between the populations goes the other way . Like , maybe more money makes people sadder , and more money makes cats sadder , but if cats are both much happier and richer than people to start with , the overall trend appears , incorrectly , to be that more money makes you happier . Of course , you can also misinterpret this graph to show that , overall , more money makes you a cat , which I think helps illustrate very well the ability to lie or reach incorrect conclusions by blindly using statistics without context ! Of course , this is not to say that statistics are always going to be paradoxical or confusing â€ “ it 's quite possible that everything will just make sense from the get-go , like if people and cats both get sadder when you give them more money , and cats are both poorer and happier than people , then the overall trend is no longer paradoxical : more money = more sadness . But it 's important to be aware that paradoxes like Simpson 's paradox are possible , and we often need more context to understand what a statistic actually means . Given the mathiness of my videos , it may not surprise you to hear that I get a lot of practice with math & physics problems while working on them , and this videoâ€™s sponsor , Brilliant.org , wants to help you stay sharp on your problem solving , too ! ( since , unfortunately , watching videos doesnâ€™t require as much problem solving ) . Practice is pretty much the best way to really get to know a subject , and Brilliant.org is ready to give you plenty with premium courses in probability , logic , and math for quantitative finance . Plus addictive puzzles : for example , â€œif half of the earth is blown away by the impact of a comet , what happens to the orbit of the moon ? â€ It almost sounds like a MinutePhysics videoâ€¦ but youâ€™re going to have to go to Brilliant.org to solve it ( or one of their many others ) â€ “ and when you do , use the URL brilliant.org/minutephysics to let Brilliant know you came from here .
