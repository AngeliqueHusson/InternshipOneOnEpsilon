welcome video z score sand z score another way average standard deviation z score one mean one standard deviation average z score negative one one standard deviation average let draw normal curve think make little bit remember last video always put average middle normal curve mu represent average always z score zero draw z score normal curve going put number zero average supposed right middle distance average one standard deviation average going positive one going positive one one standard deviation average distance two standard average going two going draw positive two represent two standard deviation average concept left except use negative one standard deviation left going negative one z score two standard deviation average going negative two z score remember previous video know empirical rule data one standard deviation concept know data area curve negative one positive one empirical rule also tell area curve two standard deviation thing data area curve negative two positive two many probably another way standard deviation wondering even need use first place particularly useful find area number curve let say somewhere standard average draw line number deviation away cant use empirical rule find area right left let say find area particularly useful use z table find area hopefully make little bit sense example let right example somewhat similar example last video video going solve test score class normally distributed mean could use normal curve give us letter mu equal standard deviation de letter sigma equal first thing going place average normal average always goes directly middle normal curve weve average directly middle curve let see problem us say probability student need find whats probability student scored let place value normal curve know value less mean place value value place value anywhere value want find probability student scoring thing find area question exactly find area need use formula need use find z value point curve equal value x minus average letter mu divided standard deviation formula memorize write formula find z score value curve let find value going equal x value minus average divided standard deviation equal simplify minus negative divided negative divided negative z score equal negative one point five going draw z value blue value value z score negative mean value average z score z value average always zero every single time right middle average going write z score zero order solve problem need solve curve notice three area left ill call section area ill ill call section area right ill call section going find area three section going use z value help first thing going going find area left z value negative order need use z table let show z table look like z table got careful type z table use theyre little bit different particular one z given left value z notice picture show area left z value ill make sure know type z table need find area left z value negative go left side table negative area negative point go right area negative forth area left point need find area left negative point number right point know area left negative one point five equal point zero six six eight could say area six point six eight percent area curve alright let take section three probably figure looking know half curve average directly middle know right half curve know area section three equal percent curve right let erase stuff right give little bit alright know far know area section one six point six eight percent total area curve know area section three equal total area curve dont know area section two point know total area curve must equal percent add area section one plus area section two area section three add together equal solve equation area section two subtract ing area one area three area section two equal one hundred percent minus area one six point six eight percent minus area fifty percent know area section two equal six point six eight minus equal forty three point three two percent let label curve know area section two forty three point three two percent area curve running space going erase stuff right everything need know order solve problem problem us probability student scored sixty need find area value sixty probability random student x scored greater sixty equal area section two plus area section three sixty well another way could say probability z value greater negative one point five equal area section two plus area section three two ways saying probability student scored sixty right let plug area section two forty three point three two percent plus area section three fifty percent probability student scored sixty forty three point three two plus equal ninety three point three two percent hope gave better idea use find probability next video talk score possible use method taught sometimes need use another method use score instead stay tuned next video really enjoying see later z score statistics z score statistics z
