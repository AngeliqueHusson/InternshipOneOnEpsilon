ill ill right get arrow gon na second term negative right wont always negative time second term negative sign prefer remind negative circle around right times squared next times multiplying times give negative times negative notice distribute combine like term may two middle term like term also additive inverse meaning theyre one trying equal zero twelve eighty cancel right theyre gone end squared minus type binomial minus cal led difference square difference two ever want figure factor word get back original alright minus times plus go ahead check video difference square ladies gentle men alright multiplying one factor ing need lesson check alright ill put description box alright good deal thats problem number right next check alright problem number quantity squared time one term inside set parentheses exponent outside repeat distribute exponent inside parentheses cant mathematically correct instead mean binomial minus three raised second power meaning times minus thats right quantity minus second power meaning multiplying must expand word first step binomial squared expand look like previous problem dealing multiplying binomial times binomial mean apply distributive property foil gon na get got get let go ahead multiply times give squared times negative negative negative negative finally negative times negative give positive right time finish always look see combine term exact variable exact exponent variable right bring squared right ill end negative positive done right saying dont like ill fix right dont know better right therefore better four squared minus twelve plus nine result thats alright let go ahead put box around next let look around number six problem number six another binomial squared binomial going expand multiplying plus times yea plus thats gon na first step see problem distribute exponent inside parenthesis right proper way going go ahead multiply everything get let forget get arrow finally second term positive right times give times x notice variable alphabetical order always identify like term ill times give x finally times gon na give positive squared done going attempt combine like term may identify like term term exact exact exponent son variable thats exactly middle term combine ill squared together positive x finally positive squared last term answer thats alright check next problem right problem number seven quantity minus times ill gon na start getting second term negative well making sure know second term negative starting gon na multiply give squared times give positive x multiplying negative times give negative finally negative times give negative squared alright next gon na combine middle term gon na write answer descending order x starting term highest exponent x variable first term squared combining x minus end positive x ill negative thats gon na answer thats done done prime number seven like last problem ladies problem number problem number plus times x minus c see happen problem right got going distribute term second set parentheses multiplying squared times x end x cube remember exponent like bases add x squared x first power plus give x third power variable ill multiplying x squared times negative z give squared z notice writing variable alphabetical order thats know rest right gon na multiply three z give positive x z right purpose writing variable alphabetical order help identify like term finished multiplying please every time well multiplying times negative z negative distribute always look see like four gentle men notice every term different combination variable dont identical variable exact variable theyre different first term x cube second term x squared z third term x z last term z squared none four term like term answer wont able add combine alright final result well ladies fort bend tutor ing multiplying binomial always please comment rate subscribe ladies gentle men please donate help us bring alright take care certainly hope
