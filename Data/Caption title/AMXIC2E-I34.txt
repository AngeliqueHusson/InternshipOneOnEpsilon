recording taken math triangle perpendicular bisector sides drawn point circumcenter know circumcenter always remains sight irrespective type triangle change position point observe figure moving point see long triangle acute mean angle less circumcenter remains inside triangle let move point angle b becomes right angle see circumcenter hereon hypotenuse c actually mid point hypotenuse right triangle circumcenter lie inside triangle lie hypotenuse say mid point hypotenuse let try making angle b obtuse yes see circumcenter move outside triangle triangle obtuse circumcenter lie outside triangle remember acute inside triangle right angled hypotenuse obtuse outside triangle let look right obtuse case separately look right triangle perpendicular bisector meet mid point hypotenuse obtuse triangle would look obtuse triangle circumcenter lie outside triangle angle obtuse circumcenter point perpendicular bisector meet circumcenter actually center circumcircle circumcircle circle vertices triangle right triangle circumcircle look something like circle drawn circumcenter center half hypotenuse radius vertices lie circumcircle obtuse triangle huge need zoom bit drawn like circumcircle obtuse triangle obtuse angle becomes circumcircle always lie inside triangle always lie inside triangle always lie inside triangle always lie inside triangle always lie inside triangle always lie inside triangle always lie inside triangle
