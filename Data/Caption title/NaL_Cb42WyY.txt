video excited make story braid together prime complex pi pleasing trio quite often modern math especially flirt riem ann zeta function three seemingly unrelated object show unison want give peek one instance happen one require heavy technical background say easy fact one intricate video ever culmination worth end formula pi certain alternating infinite sum formula actually written mug drinking coffee write fun almost certainly apocryphal story beauty formula inspired quit lawyer instead pursue math whenever see pi show math circle hi ding somewhere sometimes goal discover sum really understand circle hi ding behind see another way prove result spend meaningful time building calculus one proof leaves thinking suppose without sense hidden circle path take see fundamental truth behind sum circle certain regularity prime behave within complex start story imagine nothing pencil paper desire find formula pi countless ways approach broad outline plot line hear start many lattice point plane sit inside big circle question lead express sum two square turn lead factor ing integer inside complex plane function name chi give us formula pi first seem involve crazy complicated pattern dependent distribution slight shift perspective simplify dramatically expose ultimate gold nugget lot good math take time take step step say mean point b plane b integer point grid cross draw circle centered origin say radius many lattice point would guess inside circle well one lattice point unit area answer approximately equal area circle case really big radius like expect accurate sense percent error estimate actual count lattice point get smaller find second way answer question many lattice point circle might lead another way express area circle hence another way express pi play wonder maybe especially watched certain calculus video might try looking every possible ring lattice point could sit point b distance origin square root since b integer also integer consider ring whose radii square root whole radius give single origin point radius lattice radius lattice point hit lattice four radius actually lattice point need systematic way count many lattice point given distance away origin tally pause try moment see pattern seem pretty chaotic good sign interesting math come play fact see pattern rooted distribution example look ring radius since also since likewise really happening counting many pair integer b property look like total another example look ring radius hit lattice point correspond fact find two integer whose square add many times math see question plane surprisingly fruitful ask look like think plane set complex instead thinking lattice point pair integer think single complex number way another way think sum square multiply number cal led get reflecting real axis rep lacing might seem like strange step much history complex de scribing distance product unexpectedly useful turn question factor ing problem ultimately pattern among prime come play algebraically relation straightforward enough verify get cancel becomes also quite nice see geometrically following unfamiliar another video go detail complex multiplication look way number magnitude angle horizontal multiplying angle opposite direction positive real axis stretch es magnitude meaning land number square magnitude collection lattice point b b integer special name name martin sheen geometrically still question many lattice point integer given distance away origin like phrasing algebraic way many integer property multiplying complex conjugate give might seem needlessly complex key understanding seemingly random pattern many lattice point given distance origin see need understand factor inside integer quick refresher among ordinary integer every number unique collection prime example collection also unless make factorization negative really factorization integer perfectly unique almost unique exception factor might analogy factor ing works similarly integer like smaller integer case integer anything smaller call factorization almost unique time multiply factor get factorization look different also extra sneaky multiplying one factor another give different way factor thing get multiplying factor factorization within integer unique figure ordinary factor inside integer tell integer factor pull crucial surprising fact multiple like always exactly distinct correspond fact ring radii equal square root one always hit lattice point fact always hit see bit multiple like integer integer also unsplit table even picture correspond fact ring whose radius square root one never hit lattice point pattern regularity within ultimately exploit later video might explain earth true prime remainder divided anything whether factor inside integer hence whether expressed sum two square take given prime number special factor two rotation away multiply one get fact make us want treat little differently going remember goal count many lattice point given distance away origin systematically distance lead us formula pi counting number lattice point given magnitude like many integer property multiply complex conjugate get recipe finding integer property first factor ordinary integer since factor break four next organize two column conjugate pair sitting right next multiply column come two integer everything right conjugate everything left comes complex conjugate pair multiply make arbitrary standard call product left column output recipe notice three choice divvy affect output left column left column product could also one copy left column case product right column give output three possible output lattice point circle radius recipe yet capture lattice point well remember factorization look different multiply write factorization differently maybe splitting one affect result effect would multiply total output final step recipe say make one choice multiply product left column either three lattice point originally found account ways construct integer whose product conjugate extend best way see recipe count lattice point generally see example instead looking would choice divvy conjugate pair two column either three left column four choice final four choice multiplying product left column would suggest lattice point distance away origin indeed draw circle count find exactly lattice point introduce factor like break product two conjugate really muck whole system two column way split matter put leaves column imbalance take product column end conjugate pair number like actually lattice point hit integer whose product conjugate give extend add second factor option throw one left column right since complex conjugate keep thing balanced sense product left right column complex conjugate add new option still total choice divvy factor final choice multiplying like circle guy also exactly lattice point sum counting many lattice point lie circle radius first step factor n prime factor like factor conjugate pair number choice one exponent show factor prime factor like already split show even power one one choice odd exponent screwed zero choice matter choice end way process right think complicated part video took couple times think yes valid way count lattice point shy want pause scribble thing get feel one last thing mention factor affect count number even factor break divvy conjugate pair column first might look like double option depending choose divvy column however since multiplying one give one swap column effect output left column multiply redundant final step take product left column choose multiply either mean factor power actually change count hurt help example circle radius point one radius also point factor make difference happen number theory best complicated recipe telling us many lattice point sit circle radius depend prime factorization n turn something simpler going exploit regularity prime multiple split distinct prime factor multiple split introduce chi bring simple function label letter input multiple output chi input multiple output even give evaluate chi natural give nice cyclic pattern repeat chi special property cal led function evaluate two number multiply like result chi evaluate product two case likewise works two go ahead try show answer counting question term chi central question counting lattice point way involve factor ing number going write number choice chi first seem complicated way benefit treating prime factor way prime power like write value chi power prime one show factorization since multiple sum comes reflect fact factor give us option divvy two prime factor column something like look like since sum oscillate even power like case sum comes encapsulate fact choice unsplit table odd power sum choice two look like factor always choice neither help hurt lattice point cause always front reflect final choice multiplying output getting close culmination thing starting look organized take moment pause ponder make sure good take number example factor expression number lattice point choice choice divvy prime factor might seem like expanding sum really complicated involve looking possible combination prime factor chi multiplicative one combination correspond divisor really look like cover every number evenly works like number nothing special pretty interesting think wholly unexpected question counting number lattice point distance away origin involve value simple function divisor n remember total number lattice point inside big circle radius r hand count lattice point looking n counting many lattice point distance origin go ahead ignore origin dot radius since follow pattern rest one little dot make difference let r grow towards infinity integer factor ing chi function stuff answer n look like value chi every divisor n multiplying put corner remember bring back moment rearrange sum first value row seem super random lots factor lots divisor two divisor might think need perfect knowledge distribution get anything useful instead organize column puzzle start fit together many divisor well sum include many divisor well half account total tally third row keep going like total count lattice point look like factor ing back needs mean total number lattice point big circle approximately sum since chi even oscillate odd sum look like wan ted alternative expression number lattice point big circle know around bigger r accurate estimate error sides arbitrarily small dividing give us infinite sum converge pi reason sum simple oscillating back forth odd stem regular pattern prime factor inside integer curious two main branch es number theory algebraic number theory analytic number theory loosely speaking former deal new number system like integer loo ked latter deal thing like riem ann zeta function cousin cal led function involve multiplicative function like central character chi story path little glimpse two field intersect pretty heavy duty field lots active research unsolved problem like something take time mentally digest like pattern uncovered understood demonstrably kind people watch depth math video free time know soft ware soon tobe soft ware go little
