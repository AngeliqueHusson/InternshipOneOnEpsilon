This is a video Iâ€™ve been excited to make for a while . The story here braids together prime numbers , complex numbers and pi in a very pleasing trio . Quite often in modern math , especially that which flirts with the Riemann zeta function , these three seemingly unrelated objects show up in unison , and I want to give you a peek at one instance where this happens ; one of the few that doesnâ€™t require too heavy a technical background . Thatâ€™s not to say itâ€™s easy â€ “ in fact this is one of the most intricate videos Iâ€™ve ever doneâ€ “ but the culmination is worth it . What weâ€™ll end up with is a formula for pi , a certain alternating infinite sum . This formula is actually written on the mug Iâ€™m drinking coffee from as I write this , and a fun but almost certainly apocryphal story is that the beauty of this formula is what inspired Leibniz to quit being a lawyer to instead pursue math . Whenever you see pi show up in math , thereâ€™s a circle hiding somewhere , sometimes very sneakily . So the goal here is not just to discover this sum , but to really understand the circle hiding behind it . You see , thereâ€™s another way to prove the same result that you and I will spend some meaningful time building to with just a few lines of calculus . But itâ€™s one of those proofs that leaves you thinking â€œOkay , I suppose thatâ€™s trueâ€ , without a sense for why , for where the hidden circle is . On path you and I will take , what youâ€™ll see is that fundamental truth behind this sum and the circle it hides is a certain regularity in prime numbers behave within complex numbers . To start the story , imagine yourself with nothing more than a pencil , some paper , and a desire to find a formula for computing pi . There are countless ways to approach this , but as a broad outline for the plotline hear , youâ€™ll start by asking how many lattice points of the plane sit inside a big circle . That question can lead asking about how to express numbers as the sum of two squares , which in turn will lead to factoring integers inside the complex plane . From there , bringing in a function named chi will give us a formula for pi that at first seems to involve a crazy complicated pattern dependent on the distribution of primes , but a slight shift in perspective will simplify it dramatically and expose the ultimate gold nugget . Itâ€™s a lot , but good math takes time , and weâ€™ll take it step by step . When I say â€œlattice pointâ€ , I mean a point ( a , b ) in the plane where a and b are both integers , a point where grid lines cross . If you draw a circle centered at the origin , say with radius 10 , how many lattice points would you guess are inside that circle ? Well , thereâ€™s one lattice point for each unit of area , so the answer should be approximately equal to the area of the circle , pi*R2 , which in this case is pi ( 102 ) . And for a really big radius , like 1,000,000 , youâ€™d expect this to be more accurate , in the sense that the percent error between the estimate pi*R2 and the actual count of lattice points should get smaller . If you can find a second way to answer the same question , how many lattice points are in this circle , it might lead you to another way to express the area of a circle , and hence another way to express pi . So you play ! And you wonder . And maybe , especially if you just watched a certain calculus video , you might try looking through every possible ring that a lattice point could sit on . For each of those points , ( a , b ) , its distance from the origin in the square root of a2+b2 , and since a and b are both integers , a2+b2 is also an integer , so you only have to consider rings whose radii are the square roots of whole numbers . A radius of 0 just gives that single origin point . A radius of 1 hits 4 lattice pointsâ€¦ radius sqrt ( 2 ) hits 4 lattice points as well ... sqrt ( 3 ) doesnâ€™t hit any lattice points ... sqrt ( 4 ) hits four again ... a radius of sqrt ( 5 ) actually hits 8 lattice points ... So what you need is a systematic way to count how many lattice points are a given distance away from the origin , and to tally them all up . If you pause and try this for a moment , youâ€™ll see that the pattern seems pretty chaotic , which is a good sign that some very interesting math will come into play . In fact , as youâ€™ll see , this pattern is rooted in the distribution of primes . For example , look at the ring with radius sqrt ( 25 ) . It hits ( 5 , 0 ) , since 52 + 02 = 25 . It also hits ( 4 , 3 ) , since 42+32 = 25 , and likewise it hits ( 3 , 4 ) ... . and ( 0 , 5 ) ... Whatâ€™s really happening here is that youâ€™re counting how many pairs of integers ( a , b ) have the property that a2 + b2 = 25 , and it looks like thereâ€™s a total of 12 . As another example , look at the ring with radius sqrt ( 11 ) . It doesnâ€™t hit any lattice points , which corresponds with the fact that you can not find two integers whose squares add up to 11 . Now , many times in math when you see a question that has to do with the 2d plane , it can be surprisingly fruitful to just ask what it looks like when you think of that plane as the set of all complex numbers . So instead of thinking of this lattice point as the pair of integer coordinates ( 3 , 4 ) , think of it as the single complex number 3 + 4i . That way , another way to think of the sum of the squares of its coordinates , 32+42 , is to multiply this number by 3 - 4i . This is called its â€œcomplex conjugateâ€ , itâ€™s what you get by reflecting over the real axis , replacing i with -i . This might seem like a strange step if you donâ€™t have much of a history with complex numbers , but describing this distance as a product can be unexpectedly useful . Itâ€™ll turn our question into a factoring problem , which is ultimately why patterns among prime numbers come into play . Algebraically , this relation is straight-forward enough to verify . You get a 32 , then the 3* ( -4i ) cancels with the 4i*3 , then you have - ( 4i ) 2 , which because i2 is -1 becomes +42 . This is also quite nice to see geometrically ; and if the following feels unfamiliar , I do have another video where I go into more detail about why complex multiplication looks the way it does . The number 3+4i has a magnitude of 5 , and some angle off the horizontal . Multiplying by 3-4i rotates by that same angle in the opposite direction , putting it on the positive real axis , then stretches by that same magnitude , 5 , meaning you land on the number 25 , the square of the magnitude . The collection of all these lattice points a + bi , where a and b are integers , has a special name : the â€œGaussian integersâ€ , named after Martin Sheen . Geometrically , you will still be asking the same question , how many of these lattice points ( Gaussian integers ) are a given distance away from the origin , like sqrt ( 25 ) . But weâ€™re just phrasing it in a more algebraic way : How many gaussian integers have the property that multiplying by their complex conjugate gives 25 ? This might seem needlessly complex , but itâ€™s the key to understanding the seemingly random pattern for how many lattice points are a given distance from the origin . To see why , we need to understand how numbers factor inside the Gaussian integers . As a quick refresher , among the ordinary integers , every number can be factored as some unique collection of prime numbers . For example , 2,250 can be factored as 2*32*53 , and there is no other collection of primes that also multiplies to 2,250 . Unless you just make some of the primes in this factorization negative . So really , factorization in the integers is not perfectly unique , itâ€™s almost unique , with the exception that some of the factors might be multiplied by -1 . Analogy with primes Factoring works very similarly in Gaussian integers . Some numbers , like 5 , can be factored into smaller Gaussian integers , in this case ( 2+i ) ( 2-i ) . This Gaussian integer ( 2+i ) , can not be factored into anything smaller , so we call it a â€œGaussian primeâ€ . Again , this factorization is almost unique . But this time , not only can you multiply each of the factors by -1 to get a factorization that looks different , you can also be extra sneaky by multiplying one factor by i , and another by -1 . This gives a different way to factor 5 into Gaussian primes . But other than the things you can get by multiplying some of these factors by -1 , i or -i , factorization within the Gaussian integers is unique . If you can figure out how ordinary primes numbers factor inside the Gaussian integers , itâ€™ll tell you all all other integers factor , so here we pull in a crucial and surprising fact . Primes which are 1 above a multiple of 4 , like 5 , 13 , 17 , can be always factored into exactly 2 distinct gaussian primes . This corresponds with the fact that rings with radii equal to the square root of one of these primes always hit lattice points . In fact they always hit 8 , as youâ€™ll see in a bit . Primes that are 3 above a multiple of 4 , like 3 , 7 , 11 and so on , can not be factored further in the Gaussian integers . Not only are they primes in the integers , they are also Gaussian primes , unsplittable even when i is in the picture . This corresponds with the fact that a ring whose radius is the square root of one of these will never hit any lattice points . This pattern is the regularity within primes that weâ€™ll ultimately exploit . And in a later video I might explain why on earth this is true ; why a prime numberâ€™s remainder when divided by 4 has anything to do with whether or not it factors inside the Gaussian integers , and hence , whether it can be expressed as the sum of two squares . But here weâ€™ll take it as given . The prime number 2 is special , because it does factor , as ( 1+i ) ( 1-i ) , but these two gaussian primes are a 90o rotation away from each other , so you can multiply one by i to get the other . And that fact will make us want to treat 2 a little differently for where this is all going . Remember , our goal here is to count how many lattice points are a given distance away from the origin . Doing this systematically for all distances sqrt ( N ) can lead us to a formula for pi . And counting the number of lattice points with a given magnitude , like sqrt ( 25 ) , is the same as asking how many Gaussian integers have the property that when you multiply by its complex conjugate , you get 25 . So hereâ€™s the recipe for finding all Gaussian integer with this property . First , factor 25 , which in the ordinary integers is 52 , but since 5 factors further as ( 2+i ) ( 2-i ) , 25 breaks down into these four Gaussian primes . Next , organize these into two columns , with conjugate pairs sitting right next to each other . Now multiply whatâ€™s in each column , and youâ€™ll come out with two Gaussian integers . Because everything in the right is a conjugate to everything in the left , what comes out will be a complex conjugate pair , which multiply to make 25 . Picking an arbitrary standard , letâ€™s call that product from the left column the output of our recipe . Notice , there are three choices for how to divvy up the primes that can affect that output : Here , both copies of 2+i are in the left column , and that left column product is 3+4i ; you could also have only one copy of 2+i is in the left column , in which case that product is 5 ; or both copies of 2+i are in the right column , which will give an output of 3-4i . Those three possible outputs are all lattice points on the circle with radius sqrt ( 25 ) . So , why does this recipe not yet capture all 12 lattice points ? Well , remember how I mentioned that a factorization into gaussian primes can look different if you multiply some of them by i , -1 or -i ? If you write the factorization of 25 differently , maybe splitting up one of those 5â€™s as ( -1+2i ) ( -1-2i ) , it can affect our result . But the only effect that would have is to multiply the total output by i , -1 or -i , so as a final step to our recipe , say you have to make one of 4 choices : Multiply the product from the left column either by 1 , i , -1 or -i . The three lattice points we originally found , can each be multiplied by i , -1 , or -i , and that accounts for all 12 ways to construct a gaussian integer whose product with its own conjugate is 25 . Extend to 53 The best way to see how this recipe counts lattice points more generally is to just see more examples . If instead we were looking at 125 , which is 53 , we would have had 4 choices for how to divvy up primes conjugate pairs into the two columns , either including 0 , 1 , 2 , or all three copies of 2+i in that left column . Those four choices , multiplied by final four choices of multiplying the product from the left column by 1 , i , -1 or -i , would suggest there are 16 lattice points a distance of sqrt ( 125 ) away from the origin . And indeed , if you draw that circle and count , youâ€™ll find that it hits exactly 16 lattice points If you introduce a factor like 3 , which doesnâ€™t break down into the product of two conjugate Gaussian primes , it really mucks up the whole system . When youâ€™re divvying up primes between the two columns , thereâ€™s no way to split up that 3 . No matter where you put it , it leaves the columns imbalanced , and when you take the product of all the numbers in each column you wouldnâ€™t end up with a conjugate pair . So for a number like 3*53 , which is 375 , thereâ€™s actually no lattice point you hit ; no Gaussian integer whose product with its own conjugate gives 375 . Extend to 32*53 But if you add a second factor of 3 , then you have an option . You can throw one 3 in the left column , and the other in the right . Since 3 is its own complex conjugate , this keeps things balanced , in the sense that the products of the left and right columns will be complex conjugates of each other . But it doesnâ€™t add any new options . There will still be a total of 4 choices for how to divvy up those factors if 5 , multiplied by the final 4 choices of multiplying by 1 , i , -1 or -i . So just like the sqrt ( 125 ) circle , this guy also hits exactly 16 lattice points . Letâ€™s just sum up where we are . When youâ€™re counting how many lattice points lie on a circle with radius sqrt ( N ) , the first step is to factor N. For prime factors like 5 , 13 , and 17 , which factor into a conjugate pair of Gaussian primes , the number of choices you have is one more than the exponent that shows up with that factor . For prime factors like 3 , 7 and 11 , which are already Gaussian primes and canâ€™t be split , if they show up with an even power , you have one and only one choice for what to do with them . If itâ€™s an odd exponent , youâ€™re screwed , you have zero choices . And no matter what , you have those 4 choices at the end . By the way , this process right here is , I think , the most complicated part of the video . It took me a couple times to think through that yes , this is a valid way to count lattice points , so donâ€™t be shy if you want to pause and scribble things down to get a feel for it . The one last thing to mention is how factors of 2 affect the count . If your number is even , the factor of 2 breaks down as ( 1+i ) ( 1-i ) , so you can divvy up that conjugate pair between the columns . At first it might look like this doubles your options , depending on how you choose divvy these up between the columns . However , since multiplying one of these gaussian primes by i gives you the other one , if you swap them between the columns , the effect on the output from the left column is to multiply it by i or -i . So this is redundant with that final step , where we take the product of the left column and choose to multiply it either by 1 , i , -1 or -i . This means a factor of 2 , or any power of 2 , doesnâ€™t actually change the count at all ; it doesnâ€™t hurt , it doesnâ€™t help . For example , a circle with radius sqrt ( 5 ) hits 8 points , and one with radius sqrt ( 10 ) also hits 8 points , as does sqrt ( 20 ) ... and sqrt ( 40 ) . Factors of 2 just donâ€™t make a difference . Whatâ€™s about to happen is number theory at its best . We have this complicated recipe telling us how many lattice points sit on a circle with radius sqrt ( N ) , and it depends on the prime factorization of N. To turn it into something simpler , weâ€™re going to exploit the regularity of prime numbers that those which are 1 above a multiple of 4 split into distinct gaussian prime factors , while those that are 3 above a multiple of 4 can not be split . Introduce chi To do this , weâ€™ll bring in a simple function , which Iâ€™ll label with the greek letter â€œchiâ€ . For inputs 1 above a multiple of 4 , the output of chi is 1 . For inputs 3 above a multiple of 4 , it outputs -1 . And for even numbers , it gives 0 . So if you evaluate chi on the natural numbers , it gives this nice cyclic pattern 1 , 0 , -1 , 0 , and repeat . Chi has a special property , itâ€™s whatâ€™s called a â€œmultiplicativeâ€ function . If you evaluate it on two number and multiply , like chi ( 3 ) *chi ( 5 ) , the result is the same as chi evaluated on the product of those two numbers , in this case chi ( 15 ) . Likewise , chi ( 5 ) *chi ( 5 ) = chi ( 25 ) ... and this works for any two numbers , go ahead an try it . Show answer to counting question in terms of chi So , for our central question of counting lattice points in this way that involves factoring a number , Iâ€™m going to write the number of choices we have using chi in what at first seems to be a more complicated way , but it has the benefit of treating all prime factors the same way . For each prime power , like 53 , write ( chi ( 1 ) + chi ( 5 ) + chi ( 52 ) + chi ( 53 ) ) , adding up the value of chi on all the power of this prime up to the one that shows up in the factorization . Since 5 is 1 above a multiple of 4 , all of these are just 1 , so this sum comes out to 4 , which reflects the fact that the factor of 53 gives us 4 options for how to divvy up its two Gaussian prime factors between the columns . For something like 34 , this looks like ( chi ( 1 ) + chi ( 3 ) + chi ( 32 ) + etc. ) . Since chi ( 3 ) is -1 , this sum oscillates , 1 - 1 + 1 , etc . If itâ€™s an even power , like 4 in this case , the sum comes out to 1 , which encapsulates the fact that there is only 1 choice for what to do with those unsplittable 3â€™s . If itâ€™s an odd power , that sum is 0 , indicating that we have no choices . For powers of two , this looks like ( 1 + 0 + 0 + etc . ) , indicating that with a factor of 2 , we always have 1 choice for what to do with it , it neither helps nor hurts the lattice point cause . And as always , that 4 in front reflects the final choice of multiplying the output by 1 , i , -1 or -i. Weâ€™re getting close to the culmination now , things are starting to look organized , so take a moment , pause and ponder , make sure this all feels good . Take the number 45 as an example , which factors as 325 . The expression for the number of lattice points is 4* ( 1 + chi ( 3 ) + chi ( 32 ) ) ( 1 + chi ( 5 ) ) , which is the same as 4* ( 1 choice for what to do with the 3â€™s ) * ( 2 choices for how to divvy up the Gaussian prime factors of 5 ) . It might seem like expanding out this sum is really complicated , because it involves looking at all possible combinations of these prime factors . But because chi is multiplicative , each one of these combinations corresponds to a divisor of 45 , so really this looks like 4* ( chi ( 1 ) + chi ( 3 ) + chi ( 5 ) + chi ( 9 ) + chi ( 15 ) + chi ( 45 ) ) . This covers every number which divides evenly into 45 , once , and only once . And it works like that for any number , thereâ€™s nothing special about 45 . Thatâ€™s pretty interesting , and I think wholly unexpected . This question of counting the number of lattice points a distance sqrt ( N ) away from the origin involves adding up the value of this simple function over all divisors of N. Now , remember why weâ€™re doing all of this . The total number of lattice points inside a big circle with radius R should be about pi*R2 . But on the other hand , we can count those same lattice points by looking through all numbers N between 0 and R2 and counting how many lattice points are a distance sqrt ( N ) from the origin . Weâ€™ll go ahead and ignore the origin dot , with radius 0 , since it doesnâ€™t follow the pattern of the rest , and one little dot wonâ€™t make a difference as we let R grow towards infinity . From all of this Gaussian integer and factoring and chi function stuff weâ€™ve been doing , the answer for each N looks like adding up the value of chi on every divisor of N , and multiplying by 4 . Letâ€™s just put that 4 in the corner for now and remember to bring it back in a moment . Rearrange sum At first , adding up the values of all these rows seems super random . Numbers with lots of factors have lots of divisors , primes only have two divisors , and you might think that youâ€™d need perfect knowledge of the distribution of primes to get anything useful out of this . But if instead you organize these into columns , the puzzle starts to fit together . How many numbers between 1 and R2 have 1 as a divisors ; well , all of them , so our sum should include R2*chi ( 1 ) How many have 2 as a divisors . Well , about half of them , so that accounts for ( R2/2 ) *chi ( 2 ) in our total tally up . About a third of the rows have a chi ( 3 ) , so thatâ€™s ( R2/3 ) *chi ( 3 ) . Keep going like this , and the total count of lattice points looks like R2*chi ( 1 ) + ( R2/2 ) *chi ( 2 ) + ( R2/3 ) * chi ( 3 ) , and so on . Factoring out that R2 , and bringing back the 4 that needs to be multiplied in , this means the total number of lattice points in this big circle is approximately 4R2 ( ..this sum.. ) . Since chi is 0 on all even numbers , and oscillates between 1 and -1 for odd numbers , that sum looks like 1 - â… “ + â…• - 1/7 , and so on . This is what we wanted ! An alternative expression for the number of lattice points in a big circle , which we know to be around pi*R2 The bigger R is , the more accurate both these estimates are , so the error between these sides can be arbitrarily small . Dividing by R2 , this gives us an infinite sum which should converge to pi . And the reason this sum is so simple , just oscillating back and forth between odd numbers , stems from the regular pattern for how prime numbers factor inside the Gaussian integers . If youâ€™re curious , there are two main branches of number theory : Algebraic number theory , and analytic number theory . Very loosely speaking , the former deals with new number systems , like these Gaussian integers you and I looked at , while the latter deals with things like the Riemann zeta function , or its cousins called â€œLâ€ functions which involve multiplicative functions like the central character chi from our story . The path we just walked is a little glimpse of where those two fields intersect . Both are pretty heavy-duty fields with lots of active research and unsolved problems . So if this feels like something which will take time to mentally digest , like thereâ€™s more patterns to be uncovered and understood , itâ€™s because it is , and there are . So , you are all demonstrably the kind of people who watch in-depth math videos in your free time , and I know that some subportion of you are software engineers , or soon-to-be software engineers , so before you go thereâ€™s a little recruiting Iâ€™d like to do .
