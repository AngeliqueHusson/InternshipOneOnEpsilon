DR. .JAMES GRIME : So today we're going to talk about oneof the great unsolved problems in mathematics that went backto the Ancient Greeks , thousands of years ago , whichwas eventually solved in 1882.And the problem is called squaring the circle.And you may have even heard of the problem as a metaphor forsomething that 's impossible to do.The question is , can you make a square with the same area asthe circle ? Now you have to understand the rules.In Ancient Greece they did n't have algebra.So they could only construct numbersusing lines and circles.So you could only make things using a straight edge -- like a ruler , but not a measured ruler , just astraight edge -- and a compass.So lines and circles , those are the rules.Those are the rules the Ancient Greeks had to work by.Using those rules , can you construct a square with thesame area as the circle ? Let 's have a look at what you can dowith rules and compasses.You can add numbers.Here 's a line , and it has length a.And I add another line of length b.And the whole thing is a plus b.So you can add numbers togetherquite easily with lines.You can subtract numbers , as well.If I start with b , and then I mark off a length , which I'mgoing to call a , then this bit here , that 's goingto be b minus a.We can multiply.If I draw a little triangle here , this has length 1.And this has length a.I 'm going to scale up the triangle.I scale it up , so now this has length b , the big triangle haslength b , then this has been scaled up as well , so thatthis has a length a times b.You divide.Same idea , but it 's the reverse of that.If I took a bigger triangle , if that has a length of b , andthe long edge here has a length of a , if I scale itdown so now this has a length of 1 , then this has beenscaled down as well.And you scale it down so it has a length ofa divided by b.So you can divide by scaling triangles as well.And there 's one more thing you can do.If I draw a line here , this is a.I 'm going to add 1 to it.That 's 1.I 'm then going to draw a semicircle.And this length , here , is the square root of a.And that 's all you can do.That is it.With a ruler and a compass , you can add , multiply , divide , subtract , workout square roots , and that is it.That is all you can do.The numbers you make using those rules are calledconstructible all numbers.So all those numbers are just repeated useof those few rules.If we had a circle -- let 's this make this easy.Let 's say this circle has a radius of 1.The area of the circle is pi times the radius squared.And the radius squared , that 's 1.So the area of the circle is just pi.So I want a square with the same area.I want a square now that has an area of pi.And you may be ahead of me here , because a square has anarea of pi , the lengths of the sides are the square root ofpiNow it 's at the square root of pi.We can do square roots.That 's allowed.So there 's nothing yet to say that we ca n't do this.So what 's the problem ? Well we know that pi is irrational.Actually , that wasn't easy to work out.We only worked that out quite recently.By quite recently I mean 1761.But being irrational is not enough.There are constructible numbers that are irrational.You can make the square root of 2 quite easily.And you can make the square root of the square rootof 2 , and so on.So being irrational is not enough to say thatthis ca n't be done.If I 'm allowed to make this a bit more general , if I'mallowed to use other roots , like cube roots , or fifthroots , or nth roots , if I'm allowed to add those in aswell , the numbers that you can make using those rules arecalled algebraic numbers.That 's just a bit more general , same idea.And it turns out that they were able to prove that pi wasnot an algebraic number.And if it 's not an algebraic number , then it 's definitelynot a constructible number.Now this is what I like.The word for a number that is not algebraic is called atranscendental number , which is a fantastic word.Now to prove something is transcendental is really hard.In fact , mathematicians had shown that transcendentalnumbers existed seven years before they even found anexample of a transcendental number.So you have to imagine in those seven years , people weresaying to the mathematicians , show me a transcendentalnumber , come on , show me a transcendental number.But it was a really hard thing to do.Eventually they found a few examples of this.But we still have to wait until we were able to provethat pi itself was transcendental.And then that was done in 1882.Once we 've shown that , we've shown that pi is notconstructible.And that is a proof that you can not square the circle.BRADY : Can you only not square this circle given theparameters of these rules in this game ? Could a computer square a circle ? DR . .JAMES GRIME : You can make a square with sides that havelength root pi.Absolutely.So to the modern day people , with our tools of algebra -- algebra is fantastic.People complain about algebra , and having tolearn algebra at school.But if we did n't have algebra , we would be doing maths likethe Ancient Greeks did maths.I promise you , that would be much , much worse.Your textbooks would be ridiculous.They 'd be very wordy.Algebra is an amazing , powerful tool in mathematics.It 's not there to cause you problems.It 's there for a reason.It 's brilliant.So this is easy to make a square with the area of pi.But using the Greek rules , straight lines and circles , it 's impossible to do.BRADY : You say it 's easy to make a squarewith the area of pi.But because pi has this nature where the digits continue , andwe ca n't even get to the exact figure , surely you ca n't makea square that 's exactly pi.Because you do n't even know what pi is.Or you can do it , can you ? DR . .JAMES GRIME : You can do it and you 're treading onsomething called Zeno 's Paradox there , which we'reabout to do next.BRADY : OK.So for a second video in a row we 're going to tell peoplethey have to wait to find out more ? DR . .JAMES GRIME : If that 's the way you want to play it , Brady , that 's your choice.This is Brady 's decision.He 's stringing you along here.The representatives actually passed itunanimously , 67 to 0.They passed it.Now this is the weird bit.On the same day that they were passing the bill -- Squaring the Circle - Numberphile Squaring the Circle - Numberphile Squaring the Circle - Numberphile
