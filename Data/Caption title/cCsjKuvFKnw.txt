so welcome to my second special righttriangle video and this one we 're goingto go over a 45-45-90 triangle and justlike a 30-60-90 triangle the reason whythis 45-45-90 triangle is special isbecause the length of the longer side isproportional to the length the shortersides so let 's take a look at thisexample that I wrote for you on the leftlet 's say that the length of the shortersides are equal to X notice how bothsides are equal to X because this is anisosceles triangle each side that'sopposite the 45-degree angle is going tobe the same exact length so we 'll saythat those sides have a length of X soif the shorter sides have a length of Xin a 45-45-90 triangle we know that thelength of the longer side or thehypotenuse or you could say the lengthof the side opposite the 90-degree angleis going to have a length of Xmultiplied by the square root of two sothis is true for all 45-45-90 trianglesso we can use this information to tosolve these triangles quite easily solet 's get started right away with anexample alright so in this example let'ssay that this angle is 45 degrees inthis angle is 45 degrees and obviouslyour last angle is 90 degrees and thiswill be an easier example because I'mgoing to give you the length of one ofthese shorter sides so let 's say thatthe length of one of the shorter sidesis equal to 2 once again the sides thatare opposite the 45-degree angle arealways going to be length of the shortersides so once again this is an isoscelestriangle so if one length of the shorterside is 2 then we know the length of theother short side is also going to be 2so the length of the side opposite ofthe other 45-degree angle is also goingto be 2 units so like I said before thehypotenuse is always the side that isopposite of the 90-degree angleand we know that the length of theshorter sides are equal to two and likeI said before our shorter sides arealways going to be equal to X so we knowthat our X is equal to two and we knowthat the length of the hypotenuse or thelonger side is equal to that value of xmultiplied by the square root of two sowe need to multiply our value of x bythe square root of two so I 'm going tomultiply X by the square root of twowhatever you do to the left side you doto the right side so x times the squareroot of two is equal to two times thesquare root of two so we know that thatis our length of our longer side or ourhypotenuse so now we have solved allthree sides of this triangle like I saidbefore this is an easier example solet 's go over a little bit moredifficult one all right so this exampleis going to be a little bit harderbecause I 'm going to give you the lengthof the longer side instead of the lengthof the shorter side so let 's say thatthe length of the hypotenuse is equal totwo all right and like I said before ourhypotenuse is equal to X multiplied bythe square root of two so X multipliedby the square root of two is equal toour hypotenuse which we know has alength of two so it is equal to a lengthof two units so we do n't know our valueof x yet but we do know our value of xmultiplied by the square root of two solet 's try and solve this equation andget X by itself so I 'm going to get ridof the square root of two so I 'm goingto divide both sides by the square rootof two and on the left hand side thesquare root of two cancels out and theonly thing that we 're left with is X andon the right hand side we have twodivided by the square root of two weca n't leave our final answer with aradical in the denominator so we need torationalize you know I 'm going tomultiply both the bottom and the top bythe square root of twoand I 'm going to continue at the bottomsince I do n't really have that much morespace in the top we have two times thesquare root of two which ca n't besimplified so I 'll just rewrite that astwo times the square root of two and inthe bottom we have the square root of 2multiplied by the square root of 2 whichis just 2 this can be simplified evenfurther notice how our twos cancel outand we have X is equal to the squareroot of 2 so now we know our value of xwhich is the square root of 2 and onceagain our X is equal to the length ofthe shorter sides so we know the lengthof the shorter sides is equal to thesquare root of 2 so now we havecompletely solved all three sides ofthis triangle I hope this gave you abetter idea of how to solve a 45-45-90triangle I also have a video on a30-60-90 triangle so you can check thatout I hope you enjoyed this and I willsee you in my next one test
