hello r today going talking parabola see get video done fifteen minute cant two part let talk transformation learned long ago going basic parabola equal x squared remember like say wan ted take parabola shift right two three unit sand reflect parabola like remember made parabola seven parent function studied move around like right reflect good stuff well great dont let help going f x move parabola right remember left right movement sho wed plus minus inside function function power two going movement right x minus two inside function else parent function move three find vertical shift constant end equation usually minus three take parabola move three place refection x axis function equation star ted negative value red equation equation parent function move right two three reflection x axis minus two movement right negative three end shift well chapter book want go back watch another video class help us understand standard form parabola comes standard form parabola f x equal plus minus possible reflection x axis one graph going get appear though really less greater zero graph compressed transformation section x minus h squared plus k standard form parabola one going learn today look standard form tell lot graph tell vertex vertex parabola see right two want change sign take parenthesis negative three standard form vertex hopefully look familiar standard form getting tied section covered week ago else parabola axis symmetry line put middle parabola going vertical parabola today going x squared squared parabola horizontal study later year x squared term vertical line axis symmetry vertical line shave equation form x equal number x value axis symmetry going go going go vertex going x equal h x equal whatever x component vertex case x equal positive two axis symmetry um find going minute like x intercept also parabola graph relative maximum peak fall sides red parabola also relative maximum actually absolute maximum maximum two negative three talking domain range well domain x value graph include negative infinity positive infinity range range negative three way negative infinity case need help domain x class may say real would say domain negative infinity positive infinity calculus range particular example red parabola well value value negative three goes thus range less equal negative three interval notation start value negative infinity value negative infinity going value negative three square value negative three actually used go little tie old chapter transformation left right horizontal movement flip show get standard form parabola work today going working general form parabola let going one example graph find solution sand nice graph sketch like student lately la la la la k clean enough let take look example parabola got equal negative two x plus three x squared minus four k parabola would call general form general form want count go right mine dont exponent one two going rewrite equal three x squared minus two x minus four go let use function notation general form parabola squared plus b x plus c going graph parabola general form later year study ing conic section lot square process put general form standard form square today standard form given parabola ked graph parabola form well step one find x vertex found negative b negative negative two b c b c two three going come two six one third k great starting understand vertex part vertex found taking x value plugging back function going three times one third squared minus two times one third minus four going three times one ninth minus two third minus four little fraction work today going one third minus two third minus want put three together denominator one going multiply top bottom three common denominator negative three wont minus twelve three one minus two negative one negative one minus twelve negative thirteen three parabola vertex one third negative thirteen three good got far going erase way dont think fit board u h let see enough make sketch vertex one third comma negative thirteen three many three thirteen four leaving remainder one going negative four one third little less negative four need make another tick mark one little bit past negative four right vertex see leading coefficient leading coefficient positive parabola going open three negative parabola would open know parabola going open point could easily find help us graph parabola make sketch let take look intercept intercept want let x equal zero cross axis x horizontal movement x zero fairly easy zero switching function notation going three times zero squared minus two times zero minus four f zero intercept going negative four another point right shall color code intercept right going need erase work help us find intercept going involve factor ing quadratic formula shown little bit factor ing recently going remind quadratic formula actually done recently well anyway intercept let x equal zero going find x intercept let ting equal zero almost erased problem want find x intercept mean let equal zero want solve x intercept solve equation three x squared minus two x minus four equal zero alright let see look like quadratic formula case dont remember quadratic formula x equal negative b plus minus square root b squared minus four c two going apply quadratic formula quadratic equation general form mean three b going negative two c negative four going x equal negative b watch parenthesis plugging help plus minus square root b squared minus four c two going two plus minus square root four plus four twelve forty eight six going two plus minus square root fifty two six want reduce answer exact form fifty two square root four times square root thirteen six exact form two plus minus two square root thirteen six hah ado know x axis dont either type calculator calculator going get decimal approximation going cheat negative point eight seven one point five solve quadratic equation quadratic formula pretty sure could done factor ing well x intercept negative point eight seven negative eight point seven positive one point five parabola let see domain run time x negative infinity positive infinity parabola open forever range going value value negative four point erased oh negative four point three three infinity axis symmetry vertical line equation x equal erased everything fast well whatever x value vertex axis
