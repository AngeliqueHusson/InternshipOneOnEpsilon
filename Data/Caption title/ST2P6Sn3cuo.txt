the two triangles shown below aresimilar identify their correspondingsides and angles so we see here based onhow its marked that this angle is equalto that angle this angle with two arcshere is equal to this angle with twoarcs here and this angle over here withthree arcs is equal to this angle withthree arcs over there so that 's how wecan identify which angles correspond towhich other ones so for example angleangle c a.b angle c a.b correspondscorresponds to this angle over herewhich we can call which we can call f de corresponds to angle f d e if we sayangle ABC angle a b c this correspondsso now we 're looking at this angle rightover here angle ABC corresponds to angleD e F angle d e f and then finally angleBCA angle B C a which is that angle overthere corresponds we look at the threebars corresponds to angle e FDcorresponds to angle e FD now when wethink about corresponding sides and letme color code it actually that 'll makeit a little bit more interesting side aB so let 's say side a B side a B segmenta B I guess you could call itcorresponds to what well you can tell bylooking at the angles this is the sidebetween this one arc angle and this twoarc angle decide between the one arcangle and the two arc angle itcorresponds to side de on this trianglethe segment to segment de then if welook at at BC right over here if we lookat BC right over hereBC corresponds to its between the twobars and the three bars between the twobars and the three bars it correspondsto yeahEF another way that you could thinkabout it is that this blue side isopposite this angle angle e DF so it'sor f de we called it what we called it fde over here it 's opposite an angle andit 's opposite this angle the one arcangle the one arc angle this orange sidewas opposite the 3 arc angle it wasopposite the 3 arc angle and thenfinally if we look at this side rightover here AC AC it corresponds to wellit 's the only one that 's left but it'salso AC is opposite that 2 bar angleopposite that 2 bar angle is right overhere it corresponds to side DF thiscorresponds to side DF on this smallertriangle right over here and we 're donewe 've shown all the corresponding sidesand angles test
