TONY PADILLA : We 're going to do Buffon 's needle trick.So this is named after Georges Louie Leclerc , and this is amethod that he proposed for working out pi.So basically he proposed that you would chuck a bunch ofneedles just randomly on a floor.You can work out pi from that , yeah.BRADY HARAN : Go on , then.TONY PADILLA : Due to the random nature.So anyway , we have n't got needles , and we 're not goingto do it on a floor.We 're going to do it on one of Brady 's lovelybrown pieces of paper.And we 're going to use matches instead , because we 're cheap.So what we want is we want to draw some lines on this.So there 's one line.And what we want is we want the gaps between lines to betwo matches long.This is all very approximate.What we 're going to do is we're going to chuck a bunchof matches on this board.So I 'll just chuck the first two completely randomly.We need a lot of matches for this.If I counted these right , we should have 163.Let 's just spread them out.So hopefully , there should be 163 matches randomlydistributed around this board.Now , this is what I 've got ta do now , is I 'm going to counthow many matches cross a line.OK , so I reckon that one does.So you count , Brady , that was 1 , 2 , 3.5 , 6 , 11 , 12.13 , 14 , 51 , and I think that 's it.52.52 matches that cross the lines.There 's 163 in total.Now , let 's see.Let 's do the following calculation.So 163 divided by 52 is equal to 3.13.And that 's not bad.That 's not bad , I 'm quite happy with that.BRADY HARAN : That's very close.TONY PADILLA : Yeah , yeah.So pi is 3.141.So this is not bad.OK , so why is n't it perfect ? Because this is not a very large sample.Viewers could have a little go themselves.Just literally play the same game.If you 've got more matches , that 's better.You 'll get a better accuracy.There was a mathematician called Lazarine.He used over 3,000 needles , and he actually managed to getpi accurate to I think it was about six decimal places.What we 're seeing here is something is akin to a MonteCarlo simulation.That 's what it 's called.You basically take a random sample.The reason you get pie out of this is it 's all to do withthe angle that the match takes as playing some role here.And of course if you 're working in radians , if you gothrough a full 360 degrees , well , in radians that 's 2 pi.OK , so that 's where pi 's coming into this game , andthat 's why you can get pi out of this sort ofsetup , because the angle.So we 're going to try and explain the maths of it now.Let me say , imagine that the length of the match is l , andthat means that the distance here is 2l.There 's a few things that play a role here.There 's the position of the center of the match , whichI 'll call there.We 'll say that 's a distance x from here.And then the other thing that we 're interested in is theangle the match is making.So let 's just draw it , I guess , like so.We 're interested in that angle beta.Assuming everything's completely random.how do we measure the probability of where thecenter of the match is ? Well , the probability density of the center of the match , which is position x , is just given by essentially 1/l.The other thing that we're interested in isthe angle it makes.So this is sort of a measure of the probability of theangle it 's making.And basically , the angles that we 're interested in aresomewhere between 0 and pi/2 which is of course 90 degrees.This is where the pi 's coming in.Now , if we want to work out essentially the probabilityfor the match to cross the line , what we do iswe take these two.We have to do an integration.OK , now there 's an important point here.What 's the condition for the match to cross the line ? Well , the condition for the match to cross the line isthat x should be less than l/2 sine theta.So that means when we do the x integration , we go between 0and l/2 sine theta.OK , and of course when we do the theta integration , we'regoing between 0 and pi by 2.So we do it , theta equals 0 , this is pi/2 , 2 over l pi.2 over l pi.When we do the x integration , we get an l over 2 sine theta.And then we integrate sine theta between 0 and pi by 2.That gives me 1 , and I've got the 1/pi there , sothe answer is 1/pi.This tells me the probability that you 're going to cross theline , right ? So if I 've got n matches , and I want to work out how manycross , let me call them -- so this is the n total.And I want to work out how many cross.Then I just multiply and total that.1/pi.So n total is 163.And n crossing was 52 , I think we got , did n't we ? OK.So what you see from that if we 've got 163/pi.Let 's put an approximate sign in there.Approximately 52 , or if you like , what we actually saw wasthat pi , just rearrange this equation , soapproximately 163/52.Yeah , I 'm happy with that.Yeah , yeah.That 's good.So that 's how it works.That 's the theory behind it . test
