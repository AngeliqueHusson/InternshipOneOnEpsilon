In this video we 're going to do a couple of examples thatdeal with parallel and perpendicular lines.So you have parallel , you have perpendicular , and , of course , you have lines that are neither parallel norperpendicular.And just as a bit of review , if you 've never seen thisbefore , parallel lines , they never intersect.So let me draw some axes.So if those are my coordinate axes right there , that 's myx-axis , that is my y-axis.If this is a line that I'm drawing in magenta , a parallelline might look something like this.It 's not the exact same line , but they havethe exact same slope.If this moves a certain amount , if this change in yover change in x is a certain amount , this change in y overchange in x is the same amount.And that 's why they never intersect.So they have the same slope.Parallel lines have the same slope.Perpendicular lines , depending on how you want to view it , they 're kind of the opposite.Let 's say that this is some line.A line that is perpendicular to that will not onlyintersect the line , it will intersect it at a right angle , at a 90 degree angle.And I 'm not going to prove it for you here.I actually prove it in the linear algebra playlist . But aperpendicular line 's slope -- so let 's say that this oneright here , let 's say that yellow line has a slope of m.Then this orange line , that's perpendicular to the yellowline , is going to have a slope of negative 1 over m.Their slopes are going to be the negativeinverse of each other.Now , given this information , let 's look at a bunch of linesand figure out if they're parallel , if they'reperpendicular , or if they are neither.And to do that , we just have to keep looking at the slopes.So let 's see , they say one line passes through thepoints , 4 , negative 3 , and negative 8 , 0.Another line passes through the points , negative 1 , negative 1 , and negative 2 , 6.So let 's figure out the slopes of each of these lines.So I 'll first do this one in pink.So this slope right here , so line 1 , so I'llcall it slope 1.Slope 1 is , let 's just say it is -- well , I 'll take this asthe finishing point.So negative 3 minus 0 -- remember change in y -- negative 3 minus 0 , over 4 minus negative 8.So this is equal to negative 3 over -- this is the same thingas 4 plus 8 -- negative 3 over 12 , which isequal to negative 1/4.Divide the numerator and the denominator by 3.That 's this line.That 's the first line.Now , what about the second line ? The slope for that second line is , well , let 's take , here , negative 1 minus 6 , over negative 1 minus negative 2 isequal to -- negative 1 minus 6 is negative 7 , over negative 1minus negative 2.That 's the same thing as negative 1 plus 2.Well , that 's just 1.So the slope here is negative 7.So here , their slopes are neither equal -- so they 're notparallel -- nor are they the negativeinverse of each other.So this is neither.This is neither parallel nor perpendicular.So these two lines , they intersect , but they 're notgoing to intersect at a 90 degree angle.Let 's do a couple more of these.So I have here , once again , one line passing through thesepoints , and then another line passing through these points.So let 's just look at their slopes.So this one in the green , what 's the slope ? The slope of the green one , I'll call that the first line.We could say , let's see , change in y.So we could do negative 2 minus 14 , over -- I didnegative 2 first , so I'll do 1 first -- over 1minus negative 3.So negative 2 minus 14 is negative 16.1 minus negative 3 is the same things as 1 plus 3.That 's over 4.So this is negative 4.Now , what 's the slope of that second line right there ? So we have the slope of that second line.Let 's say 5 minus negative 3 , that 's our change in y , overnegative 2 minus 0.So this is equal to 5 minus negative 3.That 's the same thing as 5 plus 3.That 's 8.And then negative 2 minus 0 is negative 2.So this is also equal to negative 4.So these two lines are parallel.They have the exact same slope.And I encourage you to find the equations of both of theselines and graph both of these lines , and verify for yourselfthat they are indeed parallel.Let 's do this one.Once again , this is just an exercise in finding slope.So this first line has those points.Let 's figure out its slope.The slope of this first line , one line passesthrough these points.So let 's see , 3 minus negative 3 , that 's our change in y , over 3 minus negative 6.So this is the same thing as 3 plus 3 , which is 6 , over 3plus 6 , which is 9.So this first line has a slope of 2/3.What is the second line 's slope ? This was the second line there , that 's the other linepassing through these points.So the other line 's slope , let 's see , we could saynegative 8 minus 4 , over 2 minus negative 6.So what is this equal to ? Negative 8 minus 4 is negative 12.2 minus negative 6 , that 's the same thing as 2 plus 6.The negatives cancel out.So it 's negative 12 over 8 , which is the same thing if wedivide the numerator and the denominator by 4 , that'snegative 3/2.Notice , these guys are the negativeinverse of each other.If I take negative 1 over 2/3 , that is equal to negative 1times 3/2 , which is equal to negative 3/2.These guys are the negative inverses of each other.You swap the numerator and the denominator , make themnegative , and they become equal to each other.So these two lines are perpendicular.And I encourage you to find the equations -- I already gotthe slopes for you -- but find the equations of both of theselines , plot them , and verify for yourself that they areperpendicular.Let 's do one more.Find the equation of a line perpendicular to this linethat passes through the point 2 comma 8.So this first piece of information , that it'sperpendicular to that line right over there , what doesthat tell us ? Well , if it 's perpendicular to this line , its slope has to bethe negative inverse of 2/5.So its slope , the negative inverse of 2/5 , the inverse of2/5 is -- let me do it in a better color , a nicer green.If this line 's slope is negative 2/5 , the equation ofthe line we have to figure out that 's perpendicular , itsslope is going to be the inverse.So instead of 2/5 , it's going to be 5/2.Instead of being a negative , it 's going to be a positive.So this is a negative inverse of negative 2/5.Right ? You take the negative sign and it becomes positive.You swap the 5 and the 2 , you get 5/2.So that is going to have to be our slope.And we can actually use the point-slope form right here.It goes through this point right there.So let 's use point-slope form.y minus this y-value , which has to be on the line , isequal to our slope , 5/2 times x minus this x-value , thex-value when y is equal to 8.And this is the equation of the line in point-slope form.If you want to put it in slope-intercept form , you canjust do a little bit of algebra , algebraicmanipulation . y minus 8 is equal to -- let 's distributethe 5/2 -- so 5/2 x minus -- 5/2 times 2 is just -- 5.And then add 8 to both sides.You get y is equal to 5/2x.Add 8 to negative 5 , so plus 3.And we are done . test
