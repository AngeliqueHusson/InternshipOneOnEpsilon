Use the commutative law of multiplication to write 2times 34 in a different way.Simplify both expressions to show that theyhave identical results.So once again , this commutative law just meansthat order does n't matter.It sounds very fancy.Commutative law of multiplication.But all that says is that it does n't matter whether we do 2times 34 or whether we do 34 times 2.The order does not matter.We can commute the two terms . Both of these are going to getyou the same exact answer.So let 's try it out.What is 2 times 34 ? And we could write it like this , literally.You 'll almost never see it written like this , but it isliterally 2 times 34.Almost always people write the larger digit on top , or thedigit with more digits , or the number withmore digits on top.But let 's do it this way.4 times 2 is 8 , and then we 'll put a 0.3 times 2 is 6 , or you can view it as 30 times 2 is 60.Add them together.8 plus 0 is 8.6 , bring it down.It 's not being added to anything.You get 68.So 2 times 34 is 68.Now , if you do 34 times 2 , 2 times 4 is 8 , 2 times 3 is 6.That 's why it 's always nicer to write the number with moredigits on top.It also is equal to 68.So it does n't matter whether you have two groups of 34 orthirty-four groups of 2 , in either case , you'regoing to have 68 .
