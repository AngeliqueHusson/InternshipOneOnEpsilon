how to find the area of a trapezoidlet 's go ahead and recall the equationto find the area of a trapezoid Syria isone half the sum of the bases times theheight now remember the bases of atrapezoid are the sides that areparallel to each other and remember in atrapezoid there 's only one pair that isparallel to each other so these twosides can not be considered the basesokay so now that we have our equation wecan simply substitute in our values weget 1/2 of 10 and 18 times the heightnow I 'm going to follow order ofoperations and do parentheses firstthat gives me 1/2 times 28 times 17 soif I do 1/2 times 28 that 's 14 then wehave to do times 17 now let 's go aheadand multiply 14 times 17 over here if Ido that I get 238 feet squared rememberthis is area so area is always in termsof squared units and that completes ourproblem How to Find the Area of a Trapezoid How to Find the Area of a Trapezoid How to Find the Area of a Trapezoid
