is right the truth of the statement sonow we just got to determine the truthof the statement so ladies and gentlemanfewer remember we talked about truthstatements and we did n't get into thatmuch we did n't really get to that deepinto it but what we talked about is whendealing with the hypothesis and aconclusion there 's kind of fourdifferent scenarios that we could havewe could say our hypothesis is true andour conclusion is true so if our P istrue and our Q is true does that say ourstatement is true or false true right ifour hypothesis is true and ourstatements false then our statement isfalse and then anytime our hypothesiswas false anytime our hypothesis wasfalse our statement was always truethere 's only ladies and gentlemen onetime where our statement is going to befalse the only time we 're going to havea false statement is when we have a truehypothesis and a false conclusion if youhave a false false hypothesis it doesn'tmatter what the conclusion is yourstatement is still going to be true allright now so let 's go and take a look atthis and see what it says it says twoangles are congruent is it possible forus to have two angles that are congruentright okay so let 's pretend this isgoing to be a true statement let'spretend we have two angles that arecongruent then it says they are verticalangles right now remember we talkedabout vertical angles vertical anglescome from when we have the intersectionof two lines right those are verticalangles vertical angles share what arethey share Keith we 're two verticalangles sharekeye they share a vertex right and thenAlex what is it they do n't share a sideright they share a vertex but they don'tyour side so it says two angles arecongruent they share they they arevertical so if we 're going to prove thisfalse we need to be able to prove thatwe can create two angles that arecongruent that are not vertical so canwe show that two angles are congruentthat are not vertical yeah how do youhave an example oh I thought yourshaking head your own give me an exampleanybody have an example of two anglesthat are congruent that are not verticalno hmm okay how about what do I give youas a box box has four 90-degree anglesright are all those angles congruent toeach other or any of them vertical nocould you maybe what about supplementaryangles congruent means they 're gon na bethe exact same size and shape all rightso they can be the exact same measurewhat about supplementary angles theseare adjacent angles right these twoadjacent they 're both 90 degrees theyshare vertex and they share a side arethey equal in value yeah they'recongruent are they vertical angles no soguess what now I can show that mystatement is true but my conclusion isfalse therefore that statement is falseso on your homework How to use a truth table and counter example to determine the truth value of a statement How to use a truth table and counter example to determine the truth value of a statement How to use a truth table and counter example to determine the truth value of a statement
