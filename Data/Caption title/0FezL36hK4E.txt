so the property of Pascal 's trianglewhich we are going to discuss today isthe simplest property of the Pascal'striangleso before we start discussing about theproperty of Pascal 's triangle let mefirst write down the row number of thetriangle so the initial row we call itas row number zero and this is calledrow number one this is called row numbertwo and this is the three four five sixand row number seven right yes and thebeginning element of each row is calledelement number zero and the next elementis called the first element so if wetalk about row number zero it has onlyone element and which is the elementnumber zero of row number zero right sowe do n't have any first element in rownumber zero and that is why we don'thave any natural number over there rightso if we talk about the first row thiswill be the first element and the firstelement of Row 2 will be this and thefirst element of Row three will be thisif we talk about the first elements ofeach row that is actually equal to therow number right and that is what I havewritten over here first element of eachrow represents the row number and thediagonals starting from the first row isa series of natural numbers right sothis is the first row and these are thefirst elements and this is the firstelement of sixth row which is equal to 6and this is the first element of theseventh row which is actually equal to 7so the first element of each rowactually represents the row number rightor you can say the first element of eachrow of Pascal 's triangle is equal to therow number and the diagonal startingfrom first row is a series of naturalnumber so this is the one diagonalstarting from the first row right andthis is another diagonal starting fromthe firstthis one they are saying it represents aseries of natural numbers yes definitelyif you see it properly this is one twothree four five six seven and this isalso one two three four five six sevenso as I told you it is the simplestproperty of Pascal 's triangle but it hasto be there since we are discussingabout process triangle we should discusseach and every property of Pascal'striangle so this is the property wherewe find series of natural numbers in thefirst diagonal of the triangle right andthe first element of each row actuallyis equal to the row number itself rightso this is about finding the naturalnumbers in Pascal 's triangle and yes wehave few more videos where we arediscussing many more interestingproperties of Pascal 's triangle so watchthose videos so but I Pascal's Triangle and Natural numbers Pascal's Triangle and Natural numbers Pascal's Triangle and Natural numbers
