today what could the tech math channelwhat we 're gon na be having a look at inthis video is a long division ofpolynomials okay so it 's a way ofdividing your our polynomials using longdivision and this is going to lead usthen to looking at a direct way ofdividing polynomials okay a bit of atrick for a faster way of dividingpolynomials okay so we 're gon na startout with a standard way they were gonnamove to the a lot faster way so anexample of how to divide point I knowsan example of where this would look likea question while this we would look likethis say x squared and we 're going toadd 3x and we 're going to take away a toneed and into this we 're going to divideX Type three so first off we 're going tobuild a log division of these it'sreally really important that we rewritethis okay so it looks like a longdivision question so the way that we dothis is as follows I 'm going to get thisx squared plus 3x takeaway Hailey andI 'm gon na write this like a divisionquestion I 'll get rid of that it 's not avery good line and I 'll write this likea division question okay so what we haveis X take away three like I do n't knowto get rid of this first part nowbecause it 's a little bit a bit clunky Ithink so let 's get rid of that and we'llmove this so we 're going to divide thisparticular equation here now to do thiswe do the following actually before wedo I think it 's really really importantto know just something to make sure ofmake sure that your powers here are indescending order chosen you to get theodd question job-seeking question whereyou 're going to have to reorder them itlook 99 % of the questions they 're gonnabe like this where you have x squared Xnot X to thezero but just make sure this is the caseokay so it 's a really important step bythe way so first off the way that wedivide this is we look at our doubleshere we have x squared and we have X sowe look at those first numbers herewe 're the firstvariables here and we say what do weneed to multiply by X here to get xsquared or how many times X goes into xsquared here and the answer to that is Xit goes X times X times X is x squarednow what we do is we have to take thisoff our number yeah so what we do is wego x times X is x squared and x timesminus 3 is minus 3x and we 're going toput these in brackets were n't parenttheses this you wo n't call them andprobably mispronounced that and we'regoing to take that away so let 's do thatso x squared takeaway x squared yougenerally gon na find these guys canceleach other out then you 're gon na look atthis term yeah and you 're gon na have 3xand we 're gon na take awayminus 3x so if 3x takeaway minus 3xwell minus a minus is the same aspassing so our answer here is going tobe 6x now we just bring this term therewhich is minus 18okay so we get to the next part of ourquestion which is this one we have 6xtakeaway a table that 's what we haveleft and we 're still trying to dividethis X take away three into it so welook at our numbers down we say whatgoes into both what with X here and 6xbasically how many times X going to 6xand the answer is it goes into six timesokay goes in positive six times okay sonow what we do is the same sort of thingsix times X is 6x so they 're gonnacancel it over there you 've probablyworked that out alreadyand six times minus 3 is minus 18 okayand we 're going to take this away sothese two cancel each other out thereminus 18 minus minus 18well bothersome minus becomes a pastor18 plus 18 these guys also cancel eachother out so if our equation is finishedour answer is x squared plus 3x minus 18divided by X take away 3 is X plus 6so hopefully you get this okay now I'mgoing to go through one more example thelong division here just to see how yougoso I 'll rub this one in and I think I'llput a bit of a harder example here I'lldo for example this one yeah say we doI 'm gon na write it you know a good waystraight away so so we are do this isenough we 're gon na be dividing by 2 Xplus 2 and I 'm going to be dividing thatinto 8 X cubed plus 12 x squaredBoris 2xplus one okay so we 're gon na do thisusing long division now first off ourpowers are all in order so everything'sgood we can start just doing this sowhat number looking at these lovers hereat 8 X cubed and our 2x what number dowe how many times is 2x going to add Xcubed now the answer to that is it goesin for this 2 goes into 8 four times andx squared okay because X into X cubedgoes x squared times so now we 're gonnamultiply these out so we have 4x squaredtimes 2x is 8x cubed and this is goingto be added to 2 times 4x squared whichis going to be 8x squaredokay put these in brackets parent theseswe 'll take them away and we 're going toget the following we 're gon na end upwith an X to take away our X cubed gonnacancel one another out so 12x cubedtakeaway I execute 8x squared sorry 12xsquaredlike white 8x squared is gon na be 4xsquared and these numbers we 're justgonna carry down okay so we 're gon na endup with minus 2x plus 1 okay what we donow is we look at what number here andwhat number here so how many times does2x go into 4x squared it goes into howmany told us a 2 goes into 4 positivetwo x and X goes into x squared X timesokay so let 's do multiply this out again2x times 2x is 4x squared they 're gonnacancel one another right and then 2xtimes positive 2 is positive 4x okaythen we 're going to take that away okayso for takeaway for these guys are goingto cancel one another out okay whenthey 'd minus 2x takeaway positive 4 sominus to take my positive 4 is minus 6xor you do n't actually write this in adifferent colorso we 'll write this down here let mewrite this in black identity so this isgonna be minus 6xokay this one positive one is also gonnacarry down okay so we 're almost finishedwe now need to look at this number andthis number how many times is 2x goingto negative 6x it goes in negative threetimes okay so you know do the same thing- three times - three times 2x is 6xwell - 6 x + -3 times 2 is minus 6 soI 'm gon na put these in brackets wedid n't take it away my 6 take away - 6take away - 6 he 's going to be the sameas minus 6 plus 6x sorry and we 're goingto get the answer is 0 and positive whynot take away - 6 is the same aspositive 1 plus 6 so we did n't get theanswer of 7 okay so this 7 is going tobe error a minor or a major of 7 okaybecause we ca n't divide 2x plus 2 into 7we 've got a remainder so that 's areaanswer yeah they 'll think I 'm going toput up now is going to show you a way ofpretty much eradicating all of thesesteps and pretty much just goingstraight to your answer here so I reallyrecommend you check it out even or tosave yourself a scene at a time I 'll seeyou test
