today could tech math channel gon na look video long division way dividing polynomial long division going lead looking direct way dividing polynomial bit faster way gon na standard way lot faster way example divide point know san example would look question would look like say x squared going going take away need going divide x type three first going build log division really really important rewrite look like long division question way follow going get x squared plus take away hail ey dim gon na write like division question ill get rid good line ill write division question x take away three like dont know get rid first part little bit bit clunk think let get rid well move going divide particular equation following actually think really really important know something make sure make sure descending order chosen get odd question job seeking question going reorder look question theyre like x squared x x zero make sure really important step way first way divide look x squared x look first say need multiply x get x squared many times x goes x squared answer goes x times x times x x squared take number yeah x times x x squared x times minus minus going bracket werent parent theses wont call probably mispronounce going take away let x squared take away x squared generally gon na find guy cancel gon na look term yeah gon na gon na take away minus take away minus minus minus passing answer going tobe bring term minus get next part question one table thats still trying divide x take away three look say goes x many times x going answer goes six goes positive six times sort thing six times x theyre youve probably worked already six times minus minus going take away two cancel minus minus minus bothersome minus becomes plus guy also cancel equation finished answer x squared plus minus x take away x plus hopefully get go one example long division see ill rub one think ill put bit harder example ill example one yeah say gon na write know good way straight away enough gon na dividing x plus going dividing x cube plus x one gon na long division first order start number looking lover hereat x cube number many times going add answer goes goes four times x squared x x x squared times squared times cube going added times squared going put bracket parent take away going get following gon na end upwith x take away x cube one another execute squared sorry white squared gon na carry gon na minus plus look number number many times go squared goes many told us goes positive two x x goes x squared x let multiply times squared theyre one another right positive positive going take away take away guy going cancel one another minus take away positive minus take positive minus dont actually write different well write let black identity minus one positive one also almost finished need look number number many times going negative goes negative three times know thing three times three times x times minus gon na put bracket didnt take away take away away going minus plus sorry going get answer positive take away positive plus didnt get answer going tobe error minor major cant divide plus got remainder thats area answer yeah theyll think going going show way pretty much e radicating pretty much going straight answer really recommend check even save scene time ill see long division polynomial long division polynomial long division polynomial long division polynomial long division polynomial long division polynomial long division polynomial long division polynomial long division polynomial long division polynomial long division polynomial long division polynomial long division polynomial long division polynomial long division polynomial long division polynomial long division polynomial long division polynomial long division polynomial long division polynomial long division polynomial
