two year ago almost day actually put first video channel formula e pi anniversary sort want revisit idea one thing always kind da wan ted improve presentation wouldnt rehash old topic wasnt something new teach see idea underlying video take certain concept field math group theory show give formula much rich er interpretation mere association two year ago thought might fun use without group theory technical term within come see actually quite like getting math even take time two year later let go introduction basic group theory formula comes life light want quick explanation formula comfortable vector calculus ill go ahead put particularly short explanation screen pause ponder doesnt make sense dont worry going reason wan ted put group theory video though think better heck even complete proof intuition really chance change think think algebra see group theory study ing nature symmetry example square symmetric shape actually mean one way answer ask action take square leaves looking indistinguishable star ted example could rotate counterclockwise look totally star ted could also flip around vertical line still look identical fact thing perfect symmetry hard keep track action actually taken help going go ahead stick asymmetric image call one action symmetry square together make group group short particular group consist eight theres action nothing one count plus three different rotation theres four ways flip fact group right special name cal led dihedral group order eight example finite group consist ing eight action bit lot group consist infinitely many action think possible rotation example angle maybe think group act circle circle dont involve every action group rotation somewhere infinite continuum radian one nice aspect action associate one single point circle thing start choosing arbitrary point maybe one right every circle symmetry every possible rotation take marked point unique spot circle action completely determined take spot doesnt always happen group nice happen cause give us way label action otherwise pretty trick think study group particular set symmetry whether thats eight square infinite continuum circle anything else dream real heart soul study knowing play square rotate flip around vertical axis overall effect slipped diagonal line sense rotation plus vertical flip equal diagonal flip circle rotate follow rotation overall effect rotated start circle group rotation plus rotation equal rotation general group collection sort symmetric action theres kind arithmetic always take two action add together get third one apply ing one maybe think multiplying action doesnt really matter point theres way combine two action get another one collection underlying relation association pair action single action thats equivalent apply ing one thats really make group group actually crazy much modern math rooted well understanding collection action organized relation relation pair action single action get group extremely general lot different came framed term maybe familiar example ordinary actually two separate ways think group one action going look like addition another action look like multiplication little weird dont usually think action usually think counting thing let show mean think ways could slide number line left right along collection sliding action group might think group infinite line way action circle group associated individual point circle another one special group associate action unique point thing actually acting follow point start zero end example number three associated action sliding right three number negative two associated action sliding two left since thats unique action drag point zero point negative two number zero well thats associated action nothing group sliding action one associated unique real number special name additive group real reason word additive group operation apply ing one action another look like slide right three slide right two overall effect slide right three plus two five simple enough distance slide point give alternative view even one example much category group group symmetry acting object arithmetic one example arithmetic group within could also extend idea instead sliding action complex plane newly introduce vertical line would associated vertical sliding motion since action drag point zero relevant point vertical line point would associated w th action sliding plane way drag zero right point make sense call plus diagonal sliding action first sliding three right following slide correspond two vertically similarly let get feel two action generally break consider slide action well slide action imagine apply ing one right overall effect composition sliding action slid right vertically notice involve together component sliding action another way thinking complex actually mean collection sliding action complex plane goes name additive group complex upshot even complex one example group idea addition thought term successively apply ing action schizophrenic also lead completely differently completely different kind group consider new group action number line always stretch squish keeping everything evenly spaced keeping number zero fixed place yet group action nice property associate action group specific point thing acting case follow point start number one goes one one action bring point one point three instance namely factor three likewise one one action bring point one point one half namely squish ing factor one half like imagine one hand fix number zero place drag number one wherever like whilst rest number line whatever take stay evenly spaced way every single positive number associated unique squish ing action notice action look like group apply stretch three action follow stretch action overall effect applied stretch six action product two original general apply ing one action another correspond multiplying theyre associated fact name group multiplicative group positive real multiplication ordinary familiar multiplication one example general far reaching idea group arithmetic within group also extend idea complex plane id like think fixing zero place one hand dragging around point one keeping everything else evenly spaced time drag number one place real number line see group include squish ing action action rotational component well quintessential example action associated point one unit zero take drag point one point multiplicative action associated rotation notice apply action twice row overall effect rotate plane unique action bring point one negative one sense meaning action associated action associated overall effect action associated negative one another example action associated dragging one point want think broken rotation stretch factor general every one multiplicative action combination stretch squish action associated point positive real number line pure rotation pure rotation associated point circle one radius one similar sliding action additive group broken pure horizontal slide point real number line plus purely vertical slide point vertical line comparison action group break going important remember one break action purely real number action something thats specifically complex whether thats vertical additive group pure rotation multiplicative group thats quick introduction group group collection symmetric action mathematical object whether thats square circle real number line anything else dream every group certain arithmetic combine two action apply ing one action group give overall effect real complex thought two different ways group act sliding case group arithmetic look like ordinary addition act squish ing rotating action case group arithmetic look like multiplication let talk exponentiation first introduction exponent think term repeated multiplication right mean meaning something like take meaning something like consequence something might call exponential property add two exponent say broken product times expand thing seem reasonable enough right expression like much less dont really make sense think exponent repeated multiplication mean mean multiply two half time negative one time something common throughout math extend beyond original definition make sense counting something sort dont randomly think back fractional negative exponent defined always motivate trying make sure property still hold see might mean complex exponent think property saying group theory light saying input correspond multiplying output make tempting think input merely member additive group sliding action think output merely member multiplicative group squish ing action weird strange function take one kind action spit another kind action something actually comes time throughout group theory exponential property important association group guarantee compose two sliding action maybe slide negative one slide positive two correspond two output action case squish ing mathematician would describe property like saying function preserve group structure sense arithmetic within group give structure function like exponential play nicely arithmetic function group preserve arithmetic like really important throughout group theory enough earn nice fancy name homomorphism think mean additive group complex plane multiplicative group complex plane already know plug real number get real number positive real number fact exponential function take purely horizontal slide turns pure squish ing action wouldnt agree would reasonable new dimension additive action map directly new dimension multiplicative action pure rotation vertical sliding action correspond point vertical axis rotating multiplicative action correspond point circle radius one would mean exponential function like map purely vertical pure would complex vertical line multiple get map ped complex unit circle fact function input vertical slide one unit happen map rotation radian walk around unit circle cover distance different exponential function say input vertical slide one unit would map rotation radian walk around unit circle covering exactly distance make number e special exponential ex map vertical rotation vertical slide one unit corresponding map rotation exactly one radian walk around unit circle covering distance exactly one vertical slide two would map rotation two radian three unit slide correspond rotation three radian vertical slide exactly pi corresponding input pi map rotation exactly pi radian half way around circle thats multiplicative action associated number negative one might ask e base well full answer calculus mean thats birthplace e even defined ill leave another explanation screen hungry fuller description comfortable calculus higher level ill say fact exponential function proportional derivative ex alone one thats actually equal derivative important point want make though view thing lens group theory thinking input exponential function sliding action thinking output rotating action give vivid way read formula like even saying read think exponential general map purely vertical additive action perpendicular real number line pure rotation sense perpendicular real number action ex special way vertical slide pi correspond rotation exactly pi radian rotation associated number finish thing want show way think function ex transformation complex plane two quick message thankful community making video possible much way become meaningful think action gratitude also best expressed action decided turn ad new video first month giving better experience video emerald cloud lab actually one reach since company find particularly inspiring emerald unusual half soft ware half cloud lab theyre building essentially enable biologist chemist conduct research soft ware platform instead working lab scientist program experiment executed remotely emerald research lab know people company soft ware challenge theyre working really interesting currently theyre looking hi ring soft ware web engineering team well applied mathematician computer scientist scientific team interested apply ing whether thats month couple special link description video apply let emerald know hear channel alright ex transforming plane id like imagine first rolling plane cylinder wrapping vertical circle taking cylinder kind da onto plane around zero concentric circle spaced
