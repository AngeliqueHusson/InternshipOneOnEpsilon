Now that we know the basics of how decimal numbers work , let¡¯s see how we can write some special fractions using decimal numbers.I¡¯m going to call these fractions ¡°Base 10 fractions¡±because their bottom numbers are all ¡®powers of 10¡¯ , like 10 , 100 , or 1,000.Let¡¯s start with this fraction : one over ten.You should recognize that . It¡¯s one of our building blocks.And this should be easy to write as a decimal number because we have a number place just for counting tenths.So all we have to do is put a ¡®1¡¯ in the tenths place like this : zero point oneNow when you write decimal numbers , it¡¯s important that you always include the ones place.But since we don¡¯t have any ones , we just put a zero in that spot.The zero makes the decimal point easier to see.Alright¡­ so that¡¯s one tenth , but what if we have 2 over 10 instead ? All we do is change the digit in the tenths place to a ¡®2¡¯.So 2 over 10 equals 0.2In fact , we can keep counting tenths like this¡­3 tenths , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , and finally 10 tenths.But look what happened when we got to ten tenths.We don¡¯t have a digit for 10 , so we had to use the next number place over : the ones place.But that makes sense because if you have the fraction 10 over 10 , that makes a whole and the value is just ¡®1¡¯.Of course we don¡¯t really need the zero in the tenths place to write ¡®1¡¯ , but as long as the decimal point is there , at least we won¡¯t confuse it with 10.Alright , tenths are pretty easy , but what about hundredths ? Let¡¯s start with the hundredths building block : 1 over 100.To write that as a decimal , we simply put a ¡®1¡¯ in the hundredths place.We also need to put a zero in the tenths place to act as a place-holder and show that we have no tenths.And we still need to put a zero in the ones place as usual.Next let¡¯s try ¡®2¡¯ hundredths . For that , we simply put a ¡®2¡¯ in the hundredths place.Let¡¯s keep on counting with hundredths , just like we did for tenths¡­3 hundredths , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , and 10 hundredths.Ah , but look what happened when we got to 10 hundredths.Just like before , we have to use the next number place to the left ¡­the tenths place.This happens because any time you have ten of a building block , they combine to form one of the next biggest building block.For example¡­ ten hundredths is a tenth.ten tenths is one.ten ones is ten.and ten tens is a hundred.Now the next fraction after 10 over 100 is 11 over 100.If you think about it , you¡¯ll see that eleven-hundredths is really just a combination of ten-hundredths and one-hundredth.Knowing that will help us write it as a decimal.Because a group of 10 hundredths is equal to 1 tenth , we put a ¡®1¡¯ in the tenths place.And we still have that 1 hundredth left over , so we put a ¡®1¡¯ in the hundredths place.There , 11 over 100 is just 0.11 as a decimal.Fortunately , you don¡¯t have to break up the fraction into tenths and hundredths each time.Any time you have a 2 digit number over 100 , all you have to do is put those digits in the tenths and hundredths places of your decimal number.Let¡¯s look at a few more examples to help you see the pattern.24 over 100 would be 0.2432 over 100 would be 0.3278 over 100 would be 0.78and 99 over 100 would be 0.99Now , what do you think will happen if we convert the fraction 100 over 100 into a decimal ? Right , 100 has 3 digits , so we need to use another number place . Now the next one over is the ones place.That makes sense because 100 over 100 is a whole , and its value is just ¡®1¡¯.Now that we know how to convert hundredths into decimals , let¡¯s try converting thousandths.That¡¯s fractions that have 1,000 as the bottom number.Let¡¯s start with 1 over 1,000 . Now this should be easy.All we have to do is put a ¡®1¡¯ in the thousandths place.Notice that this time we need zeros in both the tenths and the hundredths place to act as place holders.Next , let¡¯s try converting 10 over 1,000.Remember that 10 thousandths is the same as 1 hundredth , so we we will put a ¡®1¡¯ in the hundredths place and we¡¯ll put a zero in the thousandths place.We don¡¯t really need the ¡®0¡¯ at the end , but it helps us see that this was 10 thousandths.Alright , what if we have 100 over 1,000.Now that¡¯s a three digit number on top , so we¡¯re going to need to use three number places : the thousandths place , the hundredths place , and the tenths place.So as you can see , 100 over 1,000 is just the same as one tenth.Let¡¯s see a few more examples¡­58 over 1,000 is 0.058.73 over 1,000 is 0.073365 over 1,000 is 0.365and 999 over 1,000 is 0.999And finally , what do you think we¡¯d get if we converted 1,000 out of 1,000 ? ¡­right again ! 1,000 over 1,000 is just a whole , so its value would be ¡®1¡¯.Okay , so we¡¯ve learned how to convert base 10 fractions into decimals , but we can go the other way too . We can start with a decimal and convert it into a fraction.Let¡¯s say we want to convert a decimal number into a fraction.All we have to do is take the decimal digits and make them the top number of a base 10 fraction.The bottom number will be determined by the smallest number place used in our decimal.For example , to convert 0.8 into a fraction , we put an 8 on the top , and a 10 on the bottom , because the smallest number place in our decimal was the tenths place.And to convert 0.29 into a fraction , we put a 29 on top and we put 100 on the bottom , because the smallest number place in our decimal was the hundredths place.And finally , to convert 0.568 into a fraction , we put 568 on top and 1,000 on the bottom , because the smallest number place in our decimal was the thousandths place.Okay¡­ so far , all of the fractions that we¡¯ve converted to decimal numbers ( and vice-versa ) have bottom numbers like 10 , 100 , or 1,000.Those fractions are easy to convert , because our number system is based on ¡®powers of 10¡¯.We have number places specifically for counting those.But what if we want to take fractions with different bottom numberslike 1/2 , 3/4 , or 8/25 , and write those as decimal numbers ? We don¡¯t have special number places for halves , fourths or twenty-fifths , so what are we going to do ? Well , you¡¯re going to have to watch the next section to find out.But first let¡¯s take a minute and review all this.If a fraction has a bottom number that is a power of 10 , then it¡¯s easy to convert it into a decimal number because there are number places just for counting base 10 fractions.To convert tenths , all you have to do is put the top number in the tenths place.To convert hundredths , you have to use both the tenths and hundredths place together.To convert thousandths , you have to use three number places , and so on¡­You can also convert from a decimal number to a fraction just by making the decimal digits the top number of the fraction , and by using a bottom number that¡¯s based on the smallest number place from our decimal.Be sure to do the exercises so you get really good at converting base 10 fractions.Learn more at www.mathanitcs.com test
