let 's see how we can construct a 60degrees angle let the initial arm of theangle beer ABC with the compass on pointB choose a convenient width maybe alittle more than half this length thenwe draw an up from above point B whichcrosses R ABC at Point D do not changethe width of the compass take thecompass to point D and make an arcacross the first say the arcs intersectat Point a to get the terminal arm allwe need to do is join points B and a andwe get R ABA as the terminal arm theangle formed here will be 60 degreesmeasure of angle ABC is 60 degrees theconstruction was really simplewe made an arc here and without changingthe width of the compass we kept it hereand made an arc intersecting theprevious one and we got a 60 degreeangleyou How do we Construct a 60 Degree Angle?
