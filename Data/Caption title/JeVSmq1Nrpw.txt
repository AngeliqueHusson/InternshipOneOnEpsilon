Hi ! Welcome to Math Antics.Now that you know all about fractions , from watching all of our fractions videos , it¡¯s time to learn about something called ¡°percentages¡±.Percentages are super important.Have you ever been in a math class and heard another student ask the teacher : Um.. excuse me¡­ teacher¡­Ah¡­ when are we ever gon na use this stuff ? Ya know¡­ like in real life ? Well when it comes to percentages , the answer is one-hundred percent of the time.Well alright¡­ maybe not a hundred percent of the time¡­ but a lot ! Percentages are used every day to calculate things like : ¡­how much sales tax you pay when you buy something.¡­how much something costs when it¡¯s on sale.¡­how much fiber is in your granola bar.¡­or how much money you can make if you invest it in the stock market.That¡¯s all real life stuff for sure.So , you can see that it¡¯s really important to understand percentages and how we use them in math.Alright then¡­ are you ready to learn the key to understanding percentages , or percents as they¡¯re called for short ? Drum roll please¡­A percent is a fraction ! Whaaaat ? That¡¯s right¡­ a percent IS a fraction ! And since you already know all about fractions , learning about percents is gon na be easy.But a percent isn¡¯t just any old fraction . A percent is a special fraction that always has 100 as the bottom number.If it¡¯s a percent , then no matter what the top number is , the bottom number will be 100.In fact , because the bottom number of a percent is always 100 , we don¡¯t even write it.Instead , we use this handy little symbol ( % ) called a percent sign.Whenever you see this symbol after a number , it means the number is a percent.It¡¯s really a fraction with 100 on the bottom , but it¡¯s just being written in this more compact form ... .like this number 15 here.It¡¯s got the percent sign after it , so we read it as `` 15 percent '' , and because a percent is really a fraction that always has 100 as the bottom number , we know that it means the same thing as 15 over 100.Percents make even more sense if you know what the word precent means.The prefix of the word ( per ) means ¡°for each¡± or ¡°for every¡± . Ya know like if someone said , ¡°only one cookie per person¡±.And the root word ( cent ) is Latin for 100 . That¡¯s why there¡¯s 100 cents in a dollar.So , percent literally means ¡°per 100¡± and that¡¯s why they¡¯re shortcuts for writing fractions that have 100 as the bottom number.Alright then , so whenever you see a percent like this , you know it can be replaced with ( or converted ) to a fraction.Let¡¯s look at a few examples so you see the pattern.3 % means 3 over 10010 % means 10 over 10025 % means 25 over 100and 75 % means 75 over 100These are percents¡­ and these are the fractions that they stand for.There¡¯s a few other interesting percents that we should take a look at.¡­like this one : 0 % ¡­can you have 0 % ? Yes ! 0 % would just mean 0 over 100 . It¡¯s what we like to call a ¡°zero fraction¡± cuz its value is just zero.Remember , it¡¯s okay to have zero on the top of a fraction , but not the bottom ! Alright then , what about 100 % . Well 100 % just means 100 over 100 . That¡¯s what we like to call a ¡°whole fraction¡±.The top number is the same as the bottom , so its value is just one whole , or 1.Okay then , 0 % is just zero , and 100 % is just 1.But what about numbers bigger than 100 ? Can you have 126 % ? Yep , it works exactly the same way . 126 % just means 126 over 100.And you know from the fractions videos , that¡¯s what we call an ¡°improper fraction¡±.The top number is bigger than the bottom number , so the fraction¡¯s value will be greater than 1.Alright team , I want you to go out there and give me a-hundred and TEN percent effort in today 's game ! But coach¡­ it would be ¡°improper¡± for us to give a-hundred and ten percent effort in today¡¯s game.Okay , so now you know the key to percentages . ¡­that they¡¯re just special fractions that always have 100 as the bottom number.But there¡¯s one more thing that I need to tell you about in this video , and that¡¯s decimals.Do you remember in the video about fractions and decimals that you can convert any fraction into its decimal value ? Sometimes it was kind of tricky converting to a decimal if we had to divide the top number by the bottom number.But other times , like when we had ¡°base-10¡± fractions , it was easy because decimal number places are made for counting base-10 fractions , ( like tenths , hundredths and thousandths ) .Well guess what¡­ Percents ARE base-10 fractions ! They are hundredths because their bottom number is always 100.That means it¡¯s really easy to re-write a percentage as a decimal number.You can do it the same way as we did in the base-10 fractions video.For example , we know that 15 % is just 15 over 100 , right ? That¡¯s its fraction form.But it also has the decimal form 0.15 because THIS is the hundredths place and 0.15 means 15 hundredths.So , we can re-write 15 % as a fraction ( 15 over 100 ) OR as a decimal ( 0.15 ) And now that you know WHY we can easily convert a percentage to a decimal , let me show you a really simple trick for doing it.First , you start with the number in percent form like this : 35 % Next , you imagine where the decimal point should be in the number 35.It¡¯s not shown , but if it was , it would be right here next to the ones place . ( Now remember , 35 and 35.0 are the same value . ) Now that you know where the decimal point is , just move it two number places to the left ( away from the percent symbol ) and draw it in right there.Last of all , once you have moved the decimal point , you erase the percent sign because you don¡¯t have a percent anymore.Moving the decimal point two places to the left converted it into the decimal value of that percent.Let¡¯s try converting a few more percents into their decimal values so you can get the hang of it.For 62 percent , we move the decimal point two places to the left and get 0.62 ( Remember , we can put an extra zero in front of the decimal point to be a place holder and to make the decimal point easier to notice . ) For 75 percent , we move the decimal point and get 0.75For 99 percent , we move the decimal point to get 0.99Pretty Cool , huh ? Okay , but what about 4 % ? You might wonder how we can move the decimal point two places over when our number only has one digit.But all we need to do is use a zero as a place holder in the number place that¡¯s missing.Then , when we move the decimal point two places over , we end up with the decimal value of 0.04.Now that makes sense because 4 is in the hundredths place and 4 % is 4 over 100.And in the same way , 1 % would just be 0.01 . Again , we need that extra zero placeholder.Here¡¯s a few more interesting examples:0 % would be just 0.00And if we have 100 % and we move the decimal point two places to the left , we end up with 1.00But 1.00 is the same value as 1 . That¡¯s why 100 % represent one whole.And if we have 142 % , we move the decimal point to get 1.42That¡¯s a value greater than one which is what we¡¯d expect because 142 % is really an improper fraction ( 142 over 100 ) Its value should be greater than 1.Alright , so now you know that a percent is a special fraction that always has 100 as the bottom number.And you know that you can re-write percents in either their fraction form OR their decimal form.25 % is 25 over 100 or 0.25But keep in mind that you could go the other way too.If someone gives you a fraction with 100 as the bottom number , you can re-write it in percent form.If you get 12 over 100 , you can say that¡¯s 12 % And if you get 80 over 100 , you can say that¡¯s 80 % OR¡­ If you get the decimal 0.10 , you can say that¡¯s 10 % and if you get the decimal 0.38 , you can say that¡¯s 38 % So , that¡¯s the key to percentages . They¡¯re another way to write fractions and decimals.But there¡¯s a lot more to learn about how they¡®re used in math , and we¡¯ll learn more about that in the next few videos.But for now , you should be sure that you really understand the basics of percentages by doing the exercises for this section.Thanks for watching Math Antics , and I¡¯ll see ya next time !
