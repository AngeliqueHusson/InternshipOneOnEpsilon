bam r going find area triangle without know base without knowing height going triangle used law n want base times height find area triangle well n know base n know height could argue could take triangle rotate make base could find height would still involve form trig function like sine cosine trig already lot work let add n need version finding area involve least first choice trig function going quicken pace finding area triangle given convenient information look like three formula thing writing based information given two sides included angle see different letter two sides included angle formula whatever like convenient understand one understand included sides making angle nice quick easy formula finding two sides included angle would pattern let go ahead find area triangle area equal one half wan ted since let use one variable angle c times b two two sides making angle included angle case c sine type calculator long degree mode radian mode times times times sine comes square n forget area two dimensional length width unit squared area let say know degree swith amount information given might kind difficult impossible find third actually real reason erase previous video law cosine angle measure erased going put back side reason look given three sides triangle n know angle could find law cosine formula going allow quickly find area triangle without much extra work want say extra work work little process little equation first find simply half perimeter plug value b c three sides triangle along one half perimeter formula boom comes answer step one find equal perimeter one half plus plus comes um well round answer much scratch let divided get know half perimeter apply square root formula comes area equal square root times sa minus side times minus b going times minus c comes drum roll please might say n copy answer second ago slightly different due round error know type calculator work little piece going done really really exactly hardly round give answer find area oblique triangle r go homework area oblique triangle formula area oblique triangle formula area oblique triangle formula area oblique triangle formula area oblique triangle formula area oblique triangle formula area oblique triangle formula area oblique triangle formula area oblique triangle formula area oblique triangle formula area oblique triangle formula area oblique triangle formula
