hi i 'm rachel coppola and today we aregoing to be going over how to teach LCMand GCF using the ladder method let'slook at the numbers 24 and 36 so now wewant to find the LCM and the GCF startoff by writing the numbers on one linelike this then make an L latter methodnow we 're going to find the smallestprime number that goes into these twonumbers in this case it 's 2 the smallestprime number so we have 2 into 24 is 12and we have 2 into 36 is 18then we do it again until we have allprime numbers so we make another L againthe smallest prime number is 2 so wedivide 2 by into 12 to get 6 right by 2into 18 to get 9 again we make the L nowthe smallest prime number that goes into6 & 9 it 's not going to be 2 it 's goingto be the next one 3 divide 6 by 3 toget to divide 9 by 3 to get 3 now wehave all prime numbers so we know thatwe finished we 're at the end to find theLCM we make an L and we add we multiplyall those numbers together on the L soLCM is going to be 2 times 2 times 3times 2 times 3 which altogether is 72the GCF you find by going straight downthis line that 's going to be 2 times 2times 3 4 times 3 is 12 and that is howyou find LCM and GCF using the laddermethod I 'm Rachel and thanks forlearning with us todayyou Teaching Kids LCM & GCF With the Ladder Method : Math Concepts Teaching Kids LCM & GCF With the Ladder Method : Math Concepts Teaching Kids LCM & GCF With the Ladder Method : Math Concepts
