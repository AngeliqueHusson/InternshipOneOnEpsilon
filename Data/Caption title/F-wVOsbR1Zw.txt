well theres two different ways like one way theyll say know ship airplane object heading bearing let say degree used measuring angle away start facing positive x direction counterclockwise positive angle clockwise negative angle find bearing orientate cardinal direction north east south west start facing north say bearing would measure clockwise north would right start facing north go clockwise thats one way thats say bearing another way theyll give well say north west south degree east give form want want facing direction first letter youd say going face north going start degree towards second letter towards west facing north degree towards west angle right degree want find angle minus thats right angle let look one south east start facing south go degree towards like would like angle right two different ways measuring go couple say say heading north degree east one saying going face north gon na head towards remember never eat sour watermelon go direction like start facing north heading twenty one point eight degree towards east thats right second example say ship head south another ship degree east far apart ship problem let see draw want draw want draw axis like label direction north east southwest start origin one ship south face south towards west like degree angle going going one south east start facing south degree towards east approximately right thats little bit longer thats south degree towards east trying find distance two ship thats right notice situation like looking length use law cosine review video talk law cosine need review well set basically total hundred angle thats two sides would wed say x squared equal plus squared minus times times cosine included angle degree would since x x squared would take square root whole thing thats going give distance two ship two different ways measure bearing either north clockwise way start facing first letter either north south head towards second ladder east west many degree hope understand bearing little bit better subscribe channel check math tube channel tutor ing look forward helping future video ill talk soon bearing math problem bearing math problem bearing math problem bearing math problem bearing math problem bearing math problem bearing math problem bearing math problem bearing math problem bearing math problem bearing math problem bearing math problem
