well there 's two different ways like Isaid one way is they 'll just say youknow a ship or an airplane or an objectis heading at a bearing or with abearing of let 's say 210 degrees nowwe 're used to measuring angles in such away that we start off facing thepositive x-direction and we hadcounterclockwise if it 's a positiveangle and then clockwise if it 's anegative angle but when you find bearingwhat you do is you orientate yourself inthese cardinal directions the north eastsouth west you start facing north and ifit says a bearing of 210 you wouldmeasure clockwise from the north 210degrees and there you would be rightthere so you start facing north and yougo clockwise okay so that 's one waythat 's when they just say bearing nowanother way is they 'll give you someother coordinates we 'll say north 20degrees west or south 30 degrees eastwhen they give it to you in this formwhat what you want to do is you want tostart facing in the direction of thatfirst letter so you 'd say I 'm going toface north and I 'm going to start toturn 20 degrees towards the secondletter towards the west so I 'm facingnorth 20 degrees towards the west that'sour angle right there 20 degrees now ifwe want to find this angle here you justdo 90 minus 20 because that 's the rightangle let 's look at this one south 30degrees east we start facing south andthen you go 30 degrees towards the eastokay like that so this would be like a30-degree angle right there so those twodifferent ways of measuring bearingslet 's go through a couple examplestogether so it says say you 're headingout north 21.8 degrees east okay so thisone is just saying okay we 're going toface north we 're gon na head towards theeast remember never eat sour watermelonyou go in that direction like thatso start facing north and we 're headingtwenty one point eight degrees towardsthe eastso that 's right there a second exampleit says a ship heads south 70 degreeswest for 10 miles another ship headssouth 40 degrees east for 15 miles howfar apart of the ships okay this is agood problem let 's see if we can drawthis what you want to draw is you wantto draw your coordinate axis like thislabel your directions north east southweststart at the origin and one ship isheading south so we face south seventydegrees towards the west like that sothis is a 70 degree angle and it 's goingfor 10 miles so I 'm just going to write10 miles the other one is South 40degrees east so we start facing southand we had 40 degrees towards the eastapproximately right there and that 's for15 miles it 's a little bit longer sothat 's south 40 degrees towards the eastnow we 're trying to find the distancebetween these two ships and that 's rightthere and what you notice is we havethis side-angle-side situation so whenyou have side-angle-side like that andyou 're looking for this length here youcan use the law of cosines and you canreview some of my videos talk about lawof cosines if you need to review thatbut we 'll set it up here so basically wehave a total of a hundred and tendegrees for that angle that 's in betweenthe two sides 10 and 15 so what we woulddo is we 'd say x squared equals 10squared plus 15 squared minus 2 times 10times 15 times the cosine of theincluded angle which is 110 degrees thenwhat you would do since you 're justsolving for x and not x squared youwould take the square root of this wholething and that 's going to give you thedistance between the two ships so againtwo different ways to measure bearingeither from the north clockwise or thesecond way start facing the first lettereither north or south and then you'regonna head towards that second laddereast or west that many degrees so I hopethis helped you understand bearing alittle bit better subscribe to thechannel check out more math tutoringvideos on my youtube channel Mario'smath tutoring and I look forward tohelping you in the future videos I'lltalk to you soon Bearing Math Problems Bearing Math Problems Bearing Math Problems
