hey everyone and welcome to mash up mapthank you so much for checking out thislesson our animated math lessons are alittle bit different than anything youmay have seen before before we getstarted just a few pointers we recommendhaving a pen and paper at your sidewhile you work through the lesson weencourage that you work along with usand write down any questions that maycome up and do n't be afraid to presspause stop and go back when you need toyou can head over to mash up math commto download the PDF notebook file thataccompanies this lesson so let 's getstarted right now we find ourselves in acrowded subway station where thousandsof people are making their daily commuteto and from work our friend Josh here isone of these daily commuters Josh startshis daily commute every morning at therailway station and finishes up at theNational Museum where he currently holdsan internship he begins his commute towork on the C subway line which he takesuntil to stop at the National Theatrewhere he transfers onto the E line whichtakes him all the way to the nationalmuseum subway stop when he is ready tocommute back home from work he must takethe same subway lines but in reverseorder in this case he 'll start on the eline which will take all the way to theNational Theater station and thentransfer to the C line which will takehim back to where he started at therailway stationnotice that the subway lines were inreverse order from when he started hiscommute in the morning to when hecommuted back home in the afternoonhowever the actual distance traveledremained the same so let 's start off bylooking at the sum of two terms here wehave a and B they could be any realnumbers and we want to know exactly whatthe commutative property looks like sohere we know that a plus B equals a plusB and equals itself for the commutativeproperty we 're just gon na take those twoterms and reverse the order so now wehave a plus B is equal to B plus a andwe 're also going to see how this holdsfor multiplication where a times Bequals B timesso for this lesson we 're going toexplore why addition and multiplicationare commutative and also why subtractionand division are not commutativeso now we 're gon na go ahead and look atan example that shows why thecommutative property holds underadditionso the definition of commutativeproperty is that a plus B is equal to Bplus a any real numbers a or B and againwe 're noticing that the terms are justin reverse order on either side of theequal sign for this example we 'll usereal numbers we are going to replace thea term with the number 2 and we 'll alsoreplace the B term with the number 8so 2 plus 8 on the left side of theequal sign is equal to 10 and on theother side of the equal sign 8 plus 2 isalso equal to 10 and we know that 10 isequal to 10 so we can say that this isan example of why the commutativeproperty holds under addition soaddition is goodwhat about subtraction now let 's look ata minus B equaling B minus a and againit will place the 8 terms with twos andthe B terms with 8 and check out thisexample 2 minus 8 on the left side ofthe equation is equal to a negative 6and then we can head on over to theright side of the equation the reverseorder 8 minus 2 which we know is equalto positive 6 now of course we notice aproblem here because negative 6 does notequal positive 6 and so this examplehelps us to understand why thecommutative property does not hold forsubtractionso to quickly summarize we know now thataddition is commutative but subtractionis notmoving on to multiplication now let'slook at the definition a times B isequal to B times a again hopefully we'restarting to notice the pattern wecommunitive property here that the termsare the same but the order is reversedso in this case for this example we'llreplace the a term with the number fourand we 'll replace the B term with thenumber eight and let 's go right to itfour times eight on the left side equalsthirty-two and on the right side of theequal signeight times four the reverse is alsoequal to 32we know that 32 is equal to itself sothis example can help us to understandwhy multiplication is commutativeso now we can check out division ifdivision is commutative then a over Bwould have to be equal to B over a solet 's go ahead and replace the aid in Bterms with the same numbers as before 4 & 8 on the left side we would have 4over 8 or 4 divided by 8 which we knowequals 1/2 and on the right side of theequal sign 8 over 4 8 divided by 4 isequal to 2 and we have a problem herebecause 1 over 2 does not equal 2 sothis example shows why the commutativeproperty does not hold for divisionwe now know and understand whymultiplication is commutative butdivision is notand now it 's time to play example or nonexample so let 's go ahead and look atour first example here 7x plus 3 isequal to 3 plus 7x now if we colorcoordinate this we can see that theterms again are in reverse order the 7xterm and the 3 term and if we go to theright side of the equal sign and reversethe order of these terms we get the samething 7x plus 3 on both sides so this isindeed an example of the commutativeproperty of additionour next example is a little bitstrange-looking and has some parenthesesin it and some different termshopefully we notice that if wedistribute on the left side of the equalsign we will result in the right side ofthe equal sign so this is a non exampleof the commutative property it is indeedan example of the distributive propertylet 's take a good look at this thirdexample before we come to a conclusionwell notice here that there are actuallytwo terms in our term in the one set ofparentheses and in the other set an Sminus 1 term hopefully here we canvisualize how the order is actuallyreversed here so this is an example ofthe commutative property it 's thecommutative property of multiplicationfor the final example we 'll take a closelook at the terms here on both sides ofthe equal sign we have AZ term a w termand a V term but we should notice thatthe terms are in the same order on bothsidesit 's the groupings that are different sothis is a non example of the commutativeproperty but an example of theassociative property of additionwell some final words here on thecommunity property we know what thecommutative property of addition and thecommutative property multiplicationlooks like and the main thing toremember here is that it is the sameterms in a reverse order thanks a lotguys you 're checking out that lessonplease subscribe to our YouTube channeland head on over to mash up math
