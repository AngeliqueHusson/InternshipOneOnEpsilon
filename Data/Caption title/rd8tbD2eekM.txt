right circular cone shaded base try derive formula surface area conelet us name point b marked circumference b form diameter let l slant height h perpendicular height let r radius circular base first let us consider circular base radius circular base r area pi r squared next need find area curved surface seen curved surface look like sector also need find area sector b look sector cone think measure two b equal slant height another interesting question length arc arc know sector part arc actually circumference circular length arc pi r sector also defined angle subtend center let us call theta ready find area sector get even interesting another way find length arc zoom look way equal theta circumference circle radius circumference formed sector pi l since l radius circle sector part tell us length arc bis part circumference big circle formed length arc b also pi r equal theta pi pi sides get r equal theta l area sector curved surface area cone area sector equal theta area circle b radius pi l squared l radius circle write bit differently yes also written pi l l split pi l squared pi l l part bracket found equal r curved surface area pi l r let us review found length arc bin two different ways equate found curved surface formula sector circle finally substituted value r formula eliminate theta simple total surface area cone curved surface area plus area circular base curved surface area know pi l rand area base pi r squared term pi r common factor taking pi r common write formula pi l plus r formula total surface area right circular cone surface area right circular cone surface area right circular cone surface area right circular cone surface area right circular cone surface area right circular cone
