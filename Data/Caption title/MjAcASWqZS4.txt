let 's see if we can simplify thisexpression here so the first thing thatit looks like we would want to do islet 's see we do n't have any like termsthat we can combine here and here liketerms would be terms that have the samethe same variables raised to the samedegree so for example if this was a xsquared Y to the 3rd then we couldcombine them but it 's not and we havenothing like that over here so let'sdistribute this 15 X Y onto here firstso 15 X Y times negative 4 well that'sgoing to be negative 60 X Y I justmultiply the 15 times the negative 4 toget the negative 60 and we still havethe X Y and then we have 15 X Y timesnegative 3 x squared Y to the third solet 's think about how this is going tohappen we 're going to have 15 timesnegative 3 which is negative 45 thenwe 're going to have x times x squaredwhich is X to the third power then we'regoing to have Y times y to the thirdpower which is y to the fourth powerjust adding the exponents you could viewthis as X to the first times y to thefirst so we did that then we have 15 X Ytimes 2y 15 times 2 is 30 and then Xthere 's nothing to multiply the X by sowe just keep leaving the X there andthen Y times y is y squared so we'vedone that and we 're gon na add all ofthis business to that stuff over thereso we have that added to Plus thisparenthesis really does n't do anythingwe 're just adding all of this stuff soplus 4 X Y squared minus 20x to the 3rdY to the third plus 70 now let 's see ifthere are any like terms that we cancombine so first of all we have thisnegative 60 XY or there any other XY Xto the first times y to the first is Xto the third Y no no no no other thingsthat it can combine with so we 'll justleave it thereso we have negative 60 X Y and thenlet 's look over here negative 45 X tothe third Y to the fourth so is thereany place where we can combine that X tothe third Y to the 4 is 2 nope no thisis X to the third Y to the thirdthat does n't work either so we just haveto keep that negative 45 X to the thirdY to the fourth power and then we have30 X Y squared so do we have anything tocombine it with well we have an X Ysquared here so we have 30 X Y Squared'sand we can have we can add another 4 X YSquared 's over here so these are liketerms just the coefficient is differentthey 're both they 're both something x XY squared so we can add the some things30 plus 4 gives us 30 for X Y Squared'sand then we have this negative 20x 2/3 Y2/3 nothing to combine that with anegative 20x to the 3rd Y to the 3rd andthen there 's nothing to combine the 70with so then we just get plus 70 and weare done test
