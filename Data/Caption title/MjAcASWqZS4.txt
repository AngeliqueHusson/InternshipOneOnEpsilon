let see simplify expression first thing look like would want islet see n like combine would term variable raised degree example x squared could combine nothing like x onto first x times negative well thats going negative x multiply times negative get negative still x x times negative x squared third think going happen going times negative negative going x times x squared x third power going times third power fourth power exponent could view x first times first x times times x nothing multiply x keep leaving x times squared weve done gon na add business stuff added plus parenthesis really n anything stuff plus x squared minus third plus let see like term combine first negative x x x first times first x third combine leave negative x let look negative x third fourth place combine x third nope x third third n work either keep negative x third fourth power x squared anything combine well x squared x squared sand add another x squared coefficient different something x x squared add plus give us x squared sand negative nothing combine negative nothing combine get plus done simplify ing expression multiple variable simplify ing expression multiple variable simplify ing expression multiple variable simplify ing expression multiple variable simplify ing expression multiple variable simplify ing expression multiple variable simplify ing expression multiple variable
