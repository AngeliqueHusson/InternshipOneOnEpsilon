video want talk finding slant asymptote rational function slant asymptote condition rational function slant asymptote occur degree numerator degree denominator got slant asymptote got x squared plus x minus degree would slant asymptote likewise middle one degree numerator degree denominator would slant asymptote likewise one end x degree numerator degree denominator power would also slant asymptote actually going find slant asymptote first two remind slant asymptote slant asymptote line line got positive slope could certainly negative slope happen could could vertical asymptote well basically large value x function get closer closer slant asymptote likewise go negative infinity function get close slant asymptote start hugging line maybe make get little bit closer way find long division youve forgotten long division going little review certainly separate specifically dedicate long division polynomial asearch find need see couple example let find slant asymptote know first two let look x squared plus x minus well one first long division thing top goes underneath x squared like make little place holder notice theres x first term going write plus outside x minus like parentheses remind distribute good guess going long division think x times going give squared well would need x first power multiply times x going x squared x times negative going give us negative subtract x squared cancel well get minus negative going us positive well drop plus one step think x times well positive thing multiply four times x give us times negative going negative subtract well get look like positive going remainder say say well write function x squared rational function x squared plus x minus say write x plus thats got top plus remainder x minus four remainder goes top whatever dividing goes bottom really whats important pick slant asymptote thing thats important basically look stuff without fraction look x plus four thats going slant asymptote equal x plus intuitively graph x squared plus x minus actually going vertical asymptote talk somewhere else think line equal x plus thats going straight line theres real rough graph didnt intend graph idea x function going get close slant asymptote likewise go negative infinity function graph would getting close slant asymptote know figure whats going middle else might find intercept go little bit depth want video slant asymptote case would line equal x plus let one one real quick let x cube minus negative x squared plus exact thing going long division basically get top long division whats going asymptote let see weve got cube thing notice theres x squared term going fill zero x squared weve got negative x outside dividing negative x squared theres zero x going fill make everything line little bit better idea arithmetic going little tricky picked one know going need negative times negative get positive well think take halves negative times negative two would cancel negative would make positive need x cube multiplying x squared think going need extra x multiply negative times everything beginning one may take know extra second want work beforehand know definitely people dont like fraction negative halves times negative thats going give us positive squared x going us x cube thats exactly need thing cancel well get x squared multiply middle let see well take negative halves times well definitely positive negative going give us negative times well left x thing three x going cancel weve got x squared weve got negative minus negative going negative plus positive remember thing smaller degree dividing thats stop long division say say write function cube minus x squared plus say really write negative going remainder x negative x squared plus mean case slant asymptote look part without fraction well guess thats h thats thats bad way saying certainly fraction basically stuff top right left negative whatever left thats going slant asymptote say slant asymptote case simply negative weve got aslant asymptote negative slope guess typically make let make dotted real quick say rational function going get close line equal negative x large value x could approaching know bottom part top part know getting closer approach negative infinity positive infinity right hope help little bit definitely another video going talk finding vertical asymptote believe already video finding
