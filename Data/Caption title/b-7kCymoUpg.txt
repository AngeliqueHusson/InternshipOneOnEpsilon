In a previous video , we derived the formulafor the sum of a finite geometric serieswhere a is the first term and r is our common ratio.What I want to do in this video is nowthink about the sum of an infinite geometric series.And I 've always found this mildly mind blowing because , or actually more than mildly mind blowing , because you'retaking the sum of an infinite things but as we see , you can actually get a finite valuedepending on what your common ratio is.So there 's a couple of ways to think about it.One is , you could say that the sumof an infinite geometric series is justa limit of this as n approaches infinity.So we could say , what is the limitas n approaches infinity of this business , of the sum from kequals zero to n of a times r to the k.Which would be the same thing as taking the limitas n approaches infinity right over here.So that would be the same thing as the limitas n approaches infinity of all of this business.Let me just copy and paste that so Ido n't have to keep switching colors.So copy and then paste.So what 's the limit as n approaches infinity here ? Let 's think about that for a second.I encourage you to pause the video , and I 'll give you one hint.Think about it for r is greater than one , for r is equal to one , and actuallylet me make it clear -- let 's thinkabout it for the absolute values of r is greater than one , the absolute values of r equal to one , and then the absolute value of r less than one.Well , I 'm assuming you 've given a go at it.So if the absolute value of r is greater than one , as this exponent explodes , as it approaches infinity , this number is just going to become massively , massively huge.And so the whole thing is just going to become , or at least you could think of the absolute valueof the whole thing , is just goingto become a very , very , very large number.If r was equal to one , then the denominatoris going to become zero.And we 're going to be dividing by that denominator , and this formula just breaks down.But where this formula can be helpful , and where we can get this to actually give usa sensical result , is when the absolute value of ris between zero and one.We 've already talked about , we 're not evendealing with the geometric , we 're not eventalking about a geometric series if r is equal to zero.So let 's think about the case where the absolute value of ris greater than zero , and it is less than one.What 's going to happen in that case ? Well , the denominator is going to make sense , right over here.And then up here , what 's going to happen ? Well , if you take something with an absolute valueless than one , and you take it to higher and higher and higherexponents , every time you multiply it by itself , you 're going to get a number with a smaller absolute value.So this term right over here , this entire term , is going to go to zero as n approaches infinity.Imagine if r was 1/2.You 're talking about 1/2 to the hundredth power,1/2 to the thousandth power , 1/2 to the millionth power,1/2 to the billionth power.That quickly approaches zero.So this goes to zero if the absolute value of ris less than one.So this , we could argue , would be equal to a over one minus r.So for example , if I had the geometric series , if I had the infinite geometric series -- let 's just have a simple one.Let 's say that my first term is one , and then each successive term I 'm going to multiply by 1/3.So it 's one plus 1/3 plus 1/3 squared plus 1/3to the third plus , and I were to just keep on going forever.This is telling us that that sum , this infinite sum -- I have an infinite number of terms here -- this is a pretty fascinating concept here -- will come out to this.It 's going to be my first term , one , over oneminus my common ratio.My common ratio in this case is 1/3.One minus 1/3 , which is the same thing as one over 2/3 , which is equal to 3/2 , or you could view it as one and 1/2.That 's a mildly amazing thing .
