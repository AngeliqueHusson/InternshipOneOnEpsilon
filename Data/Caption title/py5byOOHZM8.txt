This is kind-of a follow up to Brais ' videos on deep learningSo deep learning is kind of a big thing at the momentand there 's some disagreement between research over whether this is gon na be - the , this is *it*This is the big thing that 's gon na change everythingor whether this is another flash in the pan , like artificial neural networks were in the 80sEveryone got very excited and they got quite a good resultsand when they realized that they could n't solve all the problems with them , I do n't knowFor what it 's worth , these are a big deal , I think [ offscreen ] Let 's talk about convoluted neural networks , have I said that right ? Convolutional neural networks . [ offscreen ] Ah , right , okThey combine both deep neural networks , which is what Brais was talking aboutand kernel convolutions , which is what I talked about in a previous video.I would thoroughly recommend people watch that videoYou know , it 's got an entertaining host , right ? *laugh from offscreen*So , but , but , because , if you do n't know what a kernel convolution is , this is n't gon na make much sense to youSo watch that video first [ offscreen ] So that 's the kernel convolutions we did on graphics and things like , uh , sobel op-Yeah , Sobel operations , Gaussian blurs , and things like this.Sobel operations in particular , and edge detectionSo , if we think back to a traditional artificial neural networkok , what we 've got is we 've got some kind of input we 're trying to learn , okwe 've got some hidden layers , alright , and then we 've got some output layersmaybe just this one , I do n't knowAnd these are fully connected , so we have lots of connections from hereand here and here and these are connected to hereand so on , I 'm just drawing in a few of them , and then these are all connected to the end.ok , Now using Brais 's analogy , we were talking about house prices.ok , so , this will be something like number of bedrooms , and this would be something like `` has it got a pool '' and this would be , you know , what floor space is itand has it got a good garden and so onlots of these , ok , lots of inner nodes that we do n't really care about particularly , or I don'tUh , right , and so on and so forth , and then finally at the end we have a house price.Now what this house price is , is a complicated function of these inputs.It 's complicated becausethis node here is some linear , or non-linear now , combination ofthese . ok , so , a bit of thisplus a bit of this , plus a bit of this , plus a bit of thisthrough some non-linearity function.This is a different combination of these.This , again , different combination of these , and so on , rightAnd then this , a different combination of theseSo , you can see , you 're building up some kind of level of abstraction herewhere you 've got combinations of combinationsAnd that function is very complicatedWhen Brais talked about a black box , in some ways that 's exactly what it isbecause we ca n't look at these individual weights and say , `` well that 's got .2 of this one , so that must mean this '' because we just do n't know what it means , rightIn the grand scheme of things , in this whole network , we do n't know what that individual weight meansAnd to be honest , we might not even care that muchWhat we really care about is how well does it predict house price , how accurate is that based on thatfor a different input , so we change this , read the output - is it good ? Yes ? Brilliant ! ok , now , for images , which is obviously what I spend most of my time around , this is a start , but it 's not very useful to me.If you think that this is our inputs , ok , and I give you a picture of a house , and I say `` right , tell me how much this house is worth '' ok , well , what ? So how do I , ok , so there 's two things I could do , rightfirst of all is I could try and calculate things like number of bedrooms and stuff , based on the imageand put them in hereIn some way , I 'd be calculating some featuresand then I 'd be putting them in here and learning on those features.That is quite a smart way of doing it , because , apart from that 's obviously quite difficultum , it 's smart because we do n't have to have that many more neuronsIn anything , we can actually use the same network as we used before for our modelon our house , all we have to do is work out the bit of code that does the image analysisNow , anyone that 's tried to find out the number of rooms in a house based only on one picture of the outside of the house will tell me that that ca n't be done , rightThat 's hard.Ok , so you could naively think , what we could do insteadis just put the image in here.Make this the first pixel , and this the second pixel , and this the third pixel , and so on , ok.Then , this has got all the information it could ever need , rightBut it , but that 's the problem7 megapixel image , that 's 7 million input nodes , let 's say we have 7 million nodes on the next layereach one connects to each other one , you can see that that 's just gon na melt my computerit 's not even gon na try and create it , it 's too much informationThat 's why we downsample our space a little bit.What we would usually do is calculate some small subset of featuresand then we would put them in at this end.So that 's quite important . So , traditional machine learning is done a bit like that.So Michel 's done some videos on this . Calculate some features about someone 's faceand put that in to some machine learning algorithmWhat you do n't do is try and put the machine learning algorithm just on the facebecause it 's too much information thereUntil now , ok , right ? That 's where convolutional neural networks step in.So , convolutional neural networks replace each of these nodes with a kernel convolution.So , like , a Sobel edge detectorNow , so instead of what I would 've done before , which was run a Sobel over something and then machine learn on that , I just give this the opportunity to learn which features are interestingmaybe it is an edge detection , maybe it is a corner detectionmaybe it 's something that highlights whatever 's in the middle of the pictureOr something that highlights the top left-hand cornerit does n't really matter , and the point is I do n't know what they areright , if I give you , you know , two thousand pictures of housesand ask you to predict house prices based on the picturesI do n't know for sure , I can guess , but it might be - that how many windows it has and things like thisbut I do n't know for sure.And a computer can brute-force through those things much quicker than I can and tell meAnd then I can go , I can both predict it , and I can look back and say , `` oh , it was windows after all '' So , let 's imagine that what we have is our image , ok , soI 'm gon na move away from the house analogy now because I 'm gon na have to draw a lot of pictures of housesif I do that . Ok , so let 's talk about CNN worksUm , and why it 's useful . So , we have an image of somethingNow , I have seen convolutional neural networks used for non-imagesbut for now , we 'll just talk about imagesThis is a picture of , let 's say me . It 's , you know , it 's not a great likeness but I 'll stick by itNow , there are three channels here , ok.So this is actually a 3D volume , in some senseremember when we talked about 3D images , you could view RGB as a , in some sense , 3DSo , the first plane is our R , G , and B , or vice versaWhat we do is , if we performed a Sobel edge detection on this , what it would do is produce another image that was slightly smaller than thisand only one deep.So hypothetically , it would be another image where the edges , let 's say the horizontal edges , were highlightedSo it would kinda look like , that , or something , I do n't knowsome half of my face where the horizontal edges are highlighted , okIt 's not a great diagramBut there would only be one output , because Sobel just outputs a number between 0 and 255 , as soon as you scale it , okNow the problem is that I do n't know that Sobel 's the best thing for this task , okIt might be , right , it might be useful to detect edges on houses , to work out what their prices areor if you want to detect faces , to detect the size of the face , that kind of makes senseOn the other hand , it 's gon na produce a lot of erroneous bitsif I was sitting in front of a tree , there 's gon na be loads of edge stuff going on there that I do n't care aboutIn a convolutional neural network , what we do is we do , let 's say , 60 of these on the first layer.So we have one , and then behind it we have another one , and behind it we have another one , and behind it we another one , and so on , going this way.So the first one will be some convolution process applied to this whole imagethat takes three input channels and outputs one output channelThe next one will be a different kernel convolution operationso each of these will have a different kernelthose are our weights , those are these values hereIn sort of our analogy back to normal learningUm , and so let 's say we have 60 of those , or 64 of thoseOne of them might be detecting edges , one of them might be detecting cornersUm , and then we use them as our features for learningNow that 's a start , but we 're - this is is deep learning now , right , so what do we do nowwell , what we now do is we do more features based on these featuresSo we find combinations of corners , combinations of edges , that make something interestingMy face is not just a circle of edges , what it is is a number of corners and edges and bits of texture and thingsall in a specific shape that is unique to , uh , well , certainly to a human face , but even unique to meright , because we 're capable of distinguishing between different peopleSo , this kernel window will go down to this pixel hereok , so this will slide about this image and produce this output imageand then the next one will do the same , and the next one will do the sameThen we do the same thing on this onelet me do it in a different pen so we can see better.Here 's my red kernel convolutionand this slides about and produces another image , which is a slight combination of , maybe , corners and edgesor something . I mean , this second level , it 's not gon na be too abstract , but we 'll get the ideaSo there 's gon na be some sort of shape that 's gon na be sort of ... It 's not gon na make much sense to us , but it 'll make some sense to this machine.And there 'll be another set of these , so there 'll be lots of these , right , going backAll of these will look different and be some different representation of my face transformed in some way , to be usefulAnd again , I have n't picked these , these have been learned , just like a normal deep learning algorithmSo I have n't had to say , `` I definitely think edges are important for this '' cause I do n't know for sure.So this goes on , and we keep doing this , and sometimes we also downsample the size of these images , just to save memory , ok , but we wo n't dwell on that too much.And , because of the way that we downsample , and the way that sometimes these convolution operations slightly shrink the image , cause they do n't go all the way to the edge , rightIf you 've got a 5 by 5 kernel , you ca n't go to the edge 2 pixels cause you 're going off the edgeso we do n't worry about that , we just get slightly smallerIn the end , we end up with a much smaller image , and lots of features going all the way backSo these are my different convolutions of convolutions , of convolutions , of convolutionsAnd each one will look different , and represent something differentand we do n't know what that is.So this one , could be highlighted when it 's a face in the middle , or it could be dark when there isn'tThis one might be highlighted when there 's an ear at a certain position , and so on.Eventually , these will get down to being just one pixel , and very very longSo essentially what we 've done there is we completely removed the spatial dimension.There 's no more spatial information left , we do n't know where anything is . But we know what it is , because it 's listed in all these features.These now are our neurons at the end.So we have a couple more layers that point to these , and then finally , we have one at the end that says '' Is this a picture of Mike 's face ? `` And it produces a 1 if it is , and a 0 if it is n't . And then what we do is , just like a normal network , we train it.So we say , `` here 's a picture of me '' , ok , so this should be a 1 . And let 's say it 's 0.5.cause it 's kind of random . So we adjust these weights , and we adjust the weights inside all these kernel convolutions . [ offscreen ] So does that adjustment happen manually ? No , it happens using a , uh , well , it 's coded in , um , but it 's usually performed by a library , and it 's using a process called back propagation.So what we do is we basically predict what direction we have to move the weights in to improve our output , and then we move them over slightly in that direction.And we have to do it in reverse order , because these onesdepend on these ones , depend on these ones , and vice versa , what we do is we say , well , look , given that I 've said it 's 0.5 chance of Mike and we want a 1 , how do I change these weights here to get slightly closer to 1 ? and I do it . And then I say , `` how do I change these again to do even better ? '' and so onand then I work my way back , ok , that kind of maths we 're not gon na go into , right.A lot of these things are , are implemented in librariesSo as a researcher , I mean , much as I 'd like to implement some of these things , it takes quite a long timejust because programming takes a while , right , andAnd , it 's better for me just to apply these things and get good resultsthan it is for me to reinvent the wheel all the time , constantly , if everyone was programming the same things over and over again , no one would get anything doneSo , I 'd have to start by programming up Linux , to get , to get , I 'm not claiming I can , by the way , and , and so on . So , you know , let 's not reinvent the wheel.Um , so I do this , I send in , let 's say 1000 pictures , 500 of which are meyou know , so I 've been to a photo shoot or something , rightand 500 of which are not.And I train it so the convolutions and these weights on the output are such thatit gets 1 when it 's a picture of me and 0 when it isn't.And then I can look at these convolutions and say `` what is it about me that 's distinctive ? `` And it 's probably gon na be finding , um , you know , weird shapes on my face , rightcause it 's a bit of a weird shape , so it - things that are unique to meNow in a more general situation , there 's a big database called ImageNetThey have a competition every year to see who can classify these images the best.So dogs , cats , planes , trees , and so onOK , they 're all in there , and there 's a thousand or so images of eachright , so , we have a really big network that 's much bigger than this little one I drewand we say , `` right , let 's throw millions of images at this '' , right , thousands of cats , thousands of dogsand we have lots more outputs than just the one , and we say `` what is it ? '' and it says `` it 's a dog '' and it is . *dog bark*Convolutional neural networks have been around for a little whilebut , they 've really started to be big in about 2012 when it - when someone came along , applied one of these to ImageNet , and got incredible results.And so on and so forth . And now there 's this big push and everyone 's trying to get even better results , and even better results.Now , I work on more of the applied end of computer science , so I 'm more interested in how this affects plant science and things like thisSo that 's what we 're working on.Um , but , the kind of results we 're seeing are really really impressiveSo , I mean , case in point , I 've done , I 've done some root tip detection , so detection of root tips in images , right , of plantsand , um , I 've got some software that I 've already programmedand I 've kind of done a low-level feature detector approach to detecting root tipsand it 's about 70 % , ok , which is what you would expect , because maybe some root hair gets confused as to root tipor a bit of blotch of dirt , or maybe there 's just two root tips really close together and it gets confusedThis , the CNN that I trained , um , is 98 % accurateAnd it finds them with 99 % accuracy.It does n't make many mistakes.And that 's over thousands of images . [ offscreen ] So does that mean the work you 've done already just goes out the window ? Yep . Uh , no , to an extent , yes , and to an extent , no.You need expertise to be able to craft a network and train it and prepare the images.And there 's obviously work to be done , and there 's some disagreement over how much of a problem you can solve with a convolutional neural networkSo , there are lots more things you can do with roots beyond finding tips.Can you do all of them with a convolutional neural network ? I do n't know , we 'll see . Are we trying , but , we 'll see.Maybe not . So maybe what you do is you use this as a tool , just like other machine learning algorithms , within a package that does lots of other things as well.On the other hand , if you 're just doing cat and dog detection , you might as well use a CNN , cause it 's gon na do better than anything else.The other purpose for ways the botnet can use its parts is for distributed computing [ fades out ] [ fades in ] Now , some objects obviously are more amenable to this than others , but the more images we get , the better it is . There 's no depth involved here at all , ok test
