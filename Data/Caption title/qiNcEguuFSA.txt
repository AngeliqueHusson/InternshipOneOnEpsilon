A problem worthy of attack proves its worth by fighting back.And that 's what Fermat 's last theorem was doing , it was fighting back.So we are talking about Fermat 's last theorem I suppose the place to start is with Fermat , Pierre de Fermat , he was a 17th-century mathematician living and working inFrance - not working as a mathematicianbut working as a judge . Every evening he 'd go home - and math was his hobby -one evening he was looking at an equationwhich looks a bit like Pythagoras' equation which I suppose isX squared plus Y squared equals Z squared.And he was looking for whole number solutions to that equation , and there arelots , you know there 's 3 squared plus4 squared , 5 squared . So that 's a whole number solution tox^2 + y^2 = z^2 . Now Fermat asked himself the question : '' What if I change this equation so instead of it being x squared , what about if it 's x cubed or x to the fourth power ? Are there solutions to that equation ? So in general we 're talking aboutx^n + y^n = z^nx^n + y^n = z^nwhere n is bigger than 2 . Does that equationhave any whole number solution ? '' He thought about it for a whileand could n't find any whole number solutions , and then he went one stepfurther : not only could he not find any whole number solutions , he believed he found an argument , he beleived he found a proofthat showed without any doubt whatsoeverthere were no whole number solutions . So this is kinda weird , because we have one equation x^2 + y^2 = z^2that has not just one solution , it actually has an infinite numberof solutions.And then we have an infinite number of equations : x^3 + y^3 = z^3 , x^4 + y^4 = z^4 , an infinite number of equations which apparently have no solutions.And Fermat discovered it 's proof , and he wrotein the margin of a book he was reading that evening , called the Arithmetica by Diophantus , he wrote in the margin in his book , he wrote : I have a truly marvelous proofwhich this margin is too narrow to contain.Hanc marginis exiguitas non caperet in Latin.In other words : `` I know how to prove that this equation has no solutions , but I do n't have the space to write it down . '' And then he drops dead.It very much was a secret proof which he never wrote down , and after his death his son , Samuel Cl¨¦mantI think , rediscovered this book which had this marginal note : I have a truly marvelous proof - demonstrationem mirabilem - which these margins are too narrow to contain . In fact the book is full ofthese little annoying notes : `` I can prove this but I got ta go to feed the cat , I can provethis but I got ta go and wash my hair . `` So Fermat was quite annoying in this respect.So his son published a new version of the book- the Arithmetica by Diophantus - the book with all of Fermat 's littlenotes printed in the text . And people would look at these notes , and they were : `` Fermat said he can prove this , let 's try ! `` And one by one people rediscovered the missing proofs.And every case where Fermat said '' I have a proof '' , he was right , there was aproof , except in this one example here.Fermat 's last theorem is called Fermat's last theorem because it was the last one thatanybody could actually find the proof for . And of course because it 's the last one thatanyone can proveit 's the most precious one , it 's the one that 's the most desirable.And the more that people try , the more they fail , the more wonderful it becomes.And this goes on for decades , it goes on for centuries.Right through to the 20th century were people desperateto rediscover what Fermat 's proof might have been . [ Brady ] Is that they have widely-held that he had done it or had he disclaimed , likewas he telling the truth ? [ Singh ] I think by the time we get to 20th century it 's quite clear that this is an incredibly complex problem . Itssimple to jot down in a few scribbles what the question is , it 's easy todescribe the problem.The proof is clearly profoundand probably beyond Fermat 's reach to be honest.Some people say Fermat was just fooling around , that it was just a trick , that he left something in his book that he knew would trouble subsequent generations -I think that 's the least likely.Some people say that he did have a genuine proofand it 's beautiful , it 's elegant and it's 17th century , and we could kinda rediscover that proof but we 're just not quite clever enough.I think that 's possible but unlikely.I think the most likely explanation is Fermatthought he had a proof . Because he was working on his ownand because he did n't show this proof to anybody elsenobody could tell him : `` Ow , there is a mistake there , that line 3has got something wrong with it . '' And that 's very likely because we know thatsubsequent generations of mathematiciansthought they 'd found a proof and then they publish it and people would tearit apart and find the error.So what we 're looking for is not Fermat's proof - which was probably flawed - but we're looking for some kind of proof to see wheter Fermat was right all along ? It has a happy ending.And it starts with a ten-year-old child , a child called Andrew Wiles , who was reading a book one day -he 's growing up in Cambridge , he wents to the library , he got a book called The lastproblem by E.T . Bell.And the book is all about Fermat 's last theorem.And little Andrew Wiles , age 10 , decided that he was going to rediscover the missing proof.Because a bright ten-year-old can understand the problem . A bright ten-year-olddoes n't realize what they 're letting themselves in for , but that 's another story . And he tried , he talked about , to theschool teachers about the problem , he talked to his A-level teachers about the problem , he goes to university talked to hisundergraduate lecturers about the problem.He has a PhD and still this problem is obsessing him.I think he was about in his late 30 's by this time he was a Princeton professor -there was something called the Taniyama-Shimura conjecture whichI kinda think we do n't really want to get into at the moment -which had been proposed in the 50 's . So a conjecture is an idea thatwe do n't know whether it 's true or not , but somebody is putting it on the table . Somebodyproved that there was a link between these two conjectures.It is much as : if you could prove most of the Taniyama-Shimura conjectureyou would get Fermat 's last theorem for free . So somehow Fermat 's last theorem is embedded inthis other conjecture.And Andrew Wiles ' childhood passion , his childhood obsession is reignitedbecause he thinks the Taniyama-Shimura conjecture is worth a go.You know he thinks he can get his teeth into that . But it 's stilla crazy thing to try and do and so because it was such an absurd and ambitious challenge , Wiles did n't tell anybody about it.He worked on in complete secrecy , he started not attending committee meetings , he started going to his officeless and less , he started tofocus on this problem . Once again : not because it was the Taniyama-Shimura conjecture but because it would give himFermat 's last theorem for free.And for 7 years he worked in complete secrecyand at the end of 7 years he suddenly realizedthat he had Taniyama-Shimura and if he had Taniyama-Shimura , he had a proof of Fermat 's last theorem . He went to Cambridge , he presented his proof on ablack board , it was a three-part lecture , the world cheered , he was the front page of the New York Times , he wason CNN he was everywhere . But the sting in the taleis that in any mathematical proof you have to have it checked.You have to have it refereed and published , and when he went through the checking process somebody found a mistake . Wiles assumed that he could fix it , but the more he tried to unravel this problem the worse it became.And it became a huge embarrassment , you know you 've been loathed ( ? ) as the greatestmathematician of the 20th century , you are a hero figure and now you have to admit you made a mistake.And it took a whole year , but at the end of that yearAndrew Wiles working with a chap ( ? ) called Richard Taylormanaged to fix the proof . I think it 's a bit like the Terminator film , I often talk about , you know when you just think you'veslained the monster when you 've killed the Terminator it comes back to life andyou have to fight in one last time . And somebody , one mathematician I thinkPete Hinesonce wrote : `` A problem worthy of attackproves its worth by fighting back . '' And that 's what Fermat 's last theorem was doing , it was fighting back , but Wiles proved that he was too good . And of course what Wiles provedis that Fermat was right , this equationx^n + y^n = z^n , n bigger than 2 , has no whole number solutions and that's the end of the story . [ Brady ] If you 'd like to see a bit more from this interview with Simon , I 've got someextra footage , I 'll put a link in the description . Simon's also got a book about Fermat 's lasttheorem , that 's excellent , I recommend that , links below , and just this week he 's got a new book out -funny about that - it 's all about mathematics in the Simpsons and I thinkanyone who likes Numberphile is gon na love this one.I 'll put a link below , but he 's also done an interview with meabout Fermat 's last theorem in the Simpsons , which I think you 'll all enjoy and I 'll put that on to Numberphile really soon.But in the meantime , lots of links below I 'll put a link to the Wiles paper , a few other bits and pieces that I want you to see , so have a good look .
