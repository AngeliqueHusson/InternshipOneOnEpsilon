contradiction sounds like a bad thingright well in mathematics contradictionis extremely usefulwe often use a proof by contradictionand these can sometimes be the mostelegant beautiful proofs that there areI want to show you a really nice proofby contradiction so first of all inorder to explain what I 'm going to proveyou need to know what a rational numberis so remember that a rational number isany number that can be written as afraction of an integer divided byanother integer so let 's write down whatthis is rational number rational numbersare things that can be written down as aratio like a divided by B where a and Bare integers so let 's write down thestatement that we want to prove there isno smallest rational number greater thanzero interesting right you might thinksure I can find a smallest rationalnumber but you ca n't and here 's theproof the proof goes by contradiction sowhat we 're going to do in a proof bycontradiction is to assume that ourstatement that we are trying to prove isfalse and then we 're going to derive acontradiction and show that that 's animpossibility so what must have gonewrong well our statement must haveactually been true so let 's work throughthe details proof in a proof bycontradiction we often start by sayingsuppose not when we say suppose not wereally mean suppose that this statementwe are trying to prove is not true okaywe 've supposed that the statement is nottrue that means that there is a smallestrational number bigger than zero solet 's write that downso then there is a smallest rationalnumber let 's call it R bigger than zerofair enough so now we have our smallestrational number but what can we do withthis rational number it 's a fractionit 's sum a divided by sum B why do n't wetake R and divide it by two let 's seewhat happenswell what is our / - if you have arational number and you divide it by twoit 's still a fraction so R divided bytwo is a perfectly good rational numberis it still positive sure it is Rdivided by two is still positive so waita minute is n't R divided by two asmaller rational number bigger than zerohow can that be we just said that R isthe smallest rational number bigger thanzero this is impossible what do we dowhen it 's impossible we say this is acontradiction instead of saying this isa contradiction sometimes we just writethis symbol two arrows pointing at eachother and collapsing now there areseveral different ways to write thisoften it 's written with brackets aroundit sometimes without brackets sometimesit 's written like this with just arrowssingle arrows and sometimes we can evenget a cool symbol that looks like alightning boltthis also means contradiction also inlogic there 's another symbol that meanscontradiction but these all really meanthe same thing it means we 've reachedthe point of impossibility so somethingmust have gone wrong I must have lied toyou when I said that it 's not true inother words it is true so do n't beafraid of contradiction in mathematicsit 's an essential tool which we use allthe time to prove many things see younext time test
