Hey and let 's look at our question we'vegot two cars first off couple quickquestions for you looking at the graphyou see car a you see car B which car isgoing faster which car is going fasteronly one hand Ricky car B he says why doyou say car B why why does he say car Bfolks what do you think Anthony awesomethat works very well so it is a steeperslope nicely done so it is travelingfaster a couple more questions here howabout which car starts first which carbegins moving first and drew car a howdo you know awesome so at zero and car Bstarting how long after how long afterhis car B start yes sirawesome for car a is that a direct orpartial variation director partialvariation I know that is a direct partwhich car was I talking about I can'tremember car a you said is direct how doyou know it 's direct awesome how aboutcar B it starts on that x-axis as wellis that also direct is that also directyes it is partial how do you know it'spartial sir awesome check this out folksif I extend I 'm gon na zoom in a littlebit here I know it 's not swimming in upthere but if I extend my y-axis noticethis is negative in this area right herethese are negatives okay does n't reallymake sense I guess it could if we gobackwards right we 're going negativedistance so I could extend that y-axisand if I extend car B so here 's car B ifI extend that you 'll notice that it doeshit the y-axis except not at the originokay so you can always do that you canextend your axes you can extend yourlines okay so let 's get to Part A itsays which one has a greater speed andby how much we know which one has thegreater speed how am I going todetermine by howmuch what could I do got to see some newhands new hands Lucasdo n't be nervous they 're not evaluatingyou they 're evaluating mewhat does difference mean you do n't haveto say it the way we were saying ityesterday like what are you gonnaactually do subtract so what are wesubtracting Oh awesome so we 're gonnasubtract along the x-axis for our runvery good and know what I 'm gon na do I'mgonna zoom in on this graph real quickhere look at this I 've got the graph weknow there 's subtraction involved nowfirst things first which car do you guyswant to find the rate of change of firstor the speed let 's pick one what do youthink Grand which one you want to do carbe car B he says so let 's look at car Bhere it is how could I then use themethod we used for finding slope bysubtracting the Y 's subtracting the X'sremember we called it a difference inthe Y the difference in the X how can Ido it in this particular case what couldI do and remember guys in math there'susually more than one way to do it sowhere would I begin where would be agood part or a good point on the line tobegin what do you think of Sun awesomeso where would I begin from though anddoes n't have to be Hassan but wherewould I start this is one of theproblems that a lot of people have theygo I know how to do rise over run butwhere do I start because I could startrise over run from here I do this and Igo okay and I just start counting downhey miss come on in and then I 'm on theline but I do n't think that 's gon na workwhat do you guys think come on in you'regonna go thank youI think it 's shrunken to wash a littlebit though pull it down a little bithowever let 's look back at car B folks Igot a line I need to find the sloperemember we got to start on the lineand we got to end at the line again solet 's pick a point on car B 's line tobegin where do you want to start what doyou think where do you want to startwhat do you think Eric awesome so hesays one hour in so are you do you meanlike where we started like right hereawesome he says start right there guysit 's a great point to start great pointto start however I do have something toask you I need everybody 's eyes up atthe screen see where Eric picked thatpoint take a look at that thingsomething special about that pointbecause guess what if I go hey Danielleif I want to pick this point right therewell that point also worked she says nowhat do you guys think thumbs up or downwill that point work thumbs up can I usethat point just to do rise over run howmany thumbs down that point will notwork see some thumbs and then I seeprobably the rest maybe a bit ofuncertainty what are you thinking let'shear something yes I really like thatguys if I look right here I 'm not at aexact point on that line and if I getright up there you can see here how muchtime how much time has passed where thispoint is about what do you think howmuch time hour-and-a-halfdo I know that for certain I don'thowever when I start here where Rickywas mentioning earlier Ricky said youknow what right there let 's start theredo I know how much time has has passedI know it 's exactly 1 hour so that 's agreat point to use I could use this onehowever it 's likely that my answer willnot be exact okay so it 'll still workfor an approximation how about anotherpoint remember I got to do rise over runso that means I got to go up and I gotto go back over to get to the linesomehow pick another point onthat line so that we can get back to theline what 's another nice and I want tosay almost exact point that we can usewhat do you think Sophia awesome they'vekind of helped you out right they'regiving you a point almost saying heyguys pick meright please however could I pick adifferent point is there any other thatlook like it 's exact like if I gothrough here any others that look likeit might be exact what do you thinkthree hours at one eighty looks prettyclose I I might say it actually might bejust to the side it might be hard to seewhere you 're at however that probablywould work but it seems like these wouldbe the two logical ones to use okay sonow if I 'm doing my rise over run folksremember the rise is subtracting they-values so all I want to do here folksfor people that did n't catch thatyesterday is I want to take this Y valuewhere it lines up here and I want tosubtract it from that Y value what is myrise in this particular case what is therise Anthony cheese sorry I I callingyou that all your a sorry Andrew goahead awesome so essentially we'retaking 480 minus zero or just 480 bigmistake that I might see folks and Iguarantee you at least one of you aregoing to fall into this trap on the testready for this ready you do n't want todo this a lot of people will do thisthey start here and they go 1 2 3 4 5 67 8 and that 's the rise they say it 's 8because there 's 8 boxes but guess whateach box is 60 ok you got to count withthe actual scale have you guys seen thatmistake before I 've seen it I 've seen itI 've actually corrected tests and madethe same mistake myself so make sure youdo n't do that how about the run what'sthe run going to look like my friendshow what 's the run gon na look likeremembering we 're starting here andheading all the wayso I want to look at my ex to that exright there what 's my run going to beyes sir awesome so on top I 've got 480kilometers I 've got five hours why isthis a rate and not a ratio what do wetalked about yesterday why is that arate and not a ratio somebody knew Ithought I saw a hand over there no Meganbailed she said no how about AndrewBrown different units nicely done sothat 's why that thing is a rate insteadof a ratio remember if it 's girls andboys are both human here kilometers andours distance in time they are twodifferent units so that 's our rate ofchange can I simplify that let 's thinkfor a second what 's 500 divided by 5 500divided by 5it is obviously a hundred so is this cargoing faster or slower than 100kilometers per hour faster or slowerslower what is the exact amount yes 96kilometers per hour let 's do it for theother car let 's look at car a for asecond and I 'm just gon na erase this alittle bit here this little ditty I needyou to pick me a good point folks let'slook at car a for a second who 's got twopoints to pick for car eight two pointsAnthony awesomeawesome can you give me a coordinate forthat last point folks who 's got acoordinate for that so if I had todescribe the X and the y value awesomesix 360 is right there nicely done let'sdo the same thing how about the rise ifI subtract my Y 's for the rise I thinkthat does rhyme does it not know risefor the Y 's no okay here we gohow about that here we go there 's my Yhere 's my starting Y what is my rise inthis case what is my rise what is myrise Adam nice 360 how about the runwhat 's the run going to be irrigated hesays six let 's double check here westart here we go all the way to six andguess what six minus zero is six andwe 're in good shape so notice how we'reusing the formula without necessarilywriting out that formula I really don'tcare if you write it out however we justwant to make sure that you know not tojust count boxes all the time what 's 360divided by six first off before you gowhoa that 's too bigwhat 's 36 divided by six yes sirsix what 's 360 divided by six nice nowwhen I look at these two answers doesthat make sense does the car with thesteeper line have the faster speed whatdo you think car with the steeper linehave the fastest speed a sign it doeshave I answered the question completelywhat 's the question asking Sophiaawesome so remember guys when you'redone along question make sure you goback and look at what it actually askedme it said which one has the greaterspeed and by how much so you need thatsentence just like Sophia said so weknow that car it looks like car B is thefaster car subtract their two speeds andwe see that it 's by 36 kilometers anhour okay so that 's very important forpart a how about Part B a quick littlechat about the point of intersectionwhere is the point of intersection onthis graph where is it where would yousay the two lines intersect what do youthink Graham awesome so if we go over tothree and go up to 180 it looks likethat 's our point of intersection rightthere what does that mean in this caseif I said explain what the point ofintersection means what does it tell mewhen I just look really quickly at thegraph what does it tell me anybody knewmr . Brown when the cars pass each othernicely done so when they 're at thatpoint they are at the exact same spotokay distance wise they 're notnecessarily on top of each other butthey are both a hundred and eightykilometers from home okay and they do itat this all right very good and we willwrap that question up should I bekeeping in the conversation with MissBiagio should that stay in the video doyou think YouTube would would benefitfrom that conversation excellent it'sdone the Hammers down enjoy 4.4 (5.4) - Slope as a Rate of Change - Interpreting Slope of a Line 4.4 (5.4) - Slope as a Rate of Change - Interpreting Slope of a Line 4.4 (5.4) - Slope as a Rate of Change - Interpreting Slope of a Line
