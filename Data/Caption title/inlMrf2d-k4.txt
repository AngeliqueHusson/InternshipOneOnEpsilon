everyday language know kite flimsy thing take beach fly wind could imagine mathematician shave loo ked general shape least way theyre drawn cartoon sand say well thats interesting shape also make mathematical term shape like parallelogram like rhombus another type quadrilateral order used mathematics useful way define little bit precisely let see come couple interesting definition kite could couple interesting ways construct kite well one way could think kite look like two pair sides congruent example look like side side need congruent let make constraint touch common one pair congruent sides thats adjacent common another pair sides congruent adjacent share common one definition could make kite two pair congruent sides congruent sides adjacent might say well whats alternative congruent sides arent adjacent else could well congruent sides could opposite happen two sides congruent didnt common still dealing quadrilateral would look like well would one congruent site would congruent side right would congruent side right congruent side would situation two pair congruent sides theyre adjacent dont common side congruent side pair theyre opposite get quadrilateral still get four kite quadrilateral quadrilateral kite right parallelogram weve seen multiple times also interesting ways might see look right kite perpendicular indeed going prove property kite two two angle thing know kite sis one bisect ing two could actually construct kite way could start line could construct perpendicular bisector line another segment angle bisect segment equal segment split two connect get kite indeed get kite would look something like segment congruent adjacent segment segment congruent adjacent segment would happen two diagonal perpendicular bisector would happen scenario let draw one segment going make another segment theyre going let theyre perpendicular segment equal segment segment equal segment well still kite also satisfying constraint another type quadrilateral weve seen satisfying sides equal sides dealing rhombus also special type parallelogram go even two diagonal exact length theyre perpendicular bisector exact length ill try draw cleanly canso theyre exact length theyre perpendicular bisector halves would length well subset guess could say get square one way thinking square also rhombus rhombus also going satisfy kite theres bunch dont satisfy constraint rhombus square kite two pair congruent sides adjacent theyre usually pretty easy spot look like quadrilateral geometric shape quadrilateral geometry khan academy quadrilateral geometric shape quadrilateral geometry khan academy quadrilateral geometric shape quadrilateral geometry khan academy quadrilateral geometric shape quadrilateral geometry khan academy quadrilateral geometric shape quadrilateral geometry khan academy
