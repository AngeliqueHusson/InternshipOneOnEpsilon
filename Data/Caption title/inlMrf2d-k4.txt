everyday language know kite mean sit flimsy thing take beach fly wind could imagine mathematician shave loo ked general shape least way drawn say well thats interesting shape also make mathematical term shape like parallelogram like rhombus another type quadrilateral order used mathematics useful way define little bit precisely let see come couple interesting definition kite could couple interesting ways construct kite well one way could think kite look like two pair sides congruent example look like side side need congruent let make constraint touch common one pair congruent sides adjacent common another pair sides congruent adjacent share common one definition could make kite two pair congruent sides congruent sides adjacent might say well alternative congruent sides n adjacent else could well congruent sides could opposite happen two sides congruent n common end point still dealing quadrilateral would look like well would one congruent site would congruent side right would congruent side right congruent side would situation two pair congruent sides adjacent n common side congruent side pair opposite get quadrilateral still get four kite quadrilateral quadrilateral n kite right parallelogram seen multiple times also interesting ways might see look right kite perpendicular indeed going prove property kite two two diagonal intersect angle thing know kite sis one bisect ing two could actually construct kite way could start line could construct perpendicular bisector line another segment angle bisect segment equal segment split two connect segment get kite indeed get kite would look something like segment congruent adjacent segment segment congruent adjacent segment would happen two diagonal perpendicular bisector would happen scenario let draw one segment going make another segment going let perpendicular segment equal segment segment equal segment well still kite also satisfying constraint another type quadrilateral seen satisfying sides equal sides parallel dealing rhombus also special type parallelogram go even two diagonal exact length perpendicular bisector exact length try draw cleanly canso exact length perpendicular bisector halves would length well subset guess could say rhomb get square one way thinking square also rhombus rhombus also going satisfy kite bunch n satisfy constraint rhombus square kite two pair congruent sides adjacent usually pretty easy spot look like quadrilateral geometric shape quadrilateral geometry khan academy quadrilateral geometric shape quadrilateral geometry khan academy quadrilateral geometric shape quadrilateral geometry khan academy quadrilateral geometric shape quadrilateral geometry khan academy quadrilateral geometric shape quadrilateral geometry khan academy quadrilateral geometric shape quadrilateral geometry khan academy quadrilateral geometric shape quadrilateral geometry khan academy quadrilateral geometric shape quadrilateral geometry khan academy
