before we understand the properties of asector we need to understand what theylook like consider the circle withcenter Ohlet us randomly draw two radii or a andOB and that 's it we get a sector thisblue region is a sector it is a part ofa circle yes but we need to understandit better how do we define it we mark apoint X on the boundary of the circle torepresent arc a X B what all is a sectorsurrounded with it is surrounded by thisarc this radius and this one a sector issurrounded by an arc and two radii inthis example the sector is surrounded byarc ax B and radii a and OB now that weknow how a sector can be formed we canmove on to understanding its differenttypes there are different kinds ofsectors that can be formed look at thisfigure before looking at the sectornotice that there are two arcs formed ofax B which is the minor arc and arc a YBwhich is the major arc so this bluecolored region which contains the minorarc ax B is called the minor sector andthis red color region which contains themajor rock a YB is called the majorsector these are basic terminologies weneed to keep in mind before we try tounderstand its applicationsremember sector containing the minorrock is the minor sector and the sectorcontaining the major rock is a majorsectoryou test
