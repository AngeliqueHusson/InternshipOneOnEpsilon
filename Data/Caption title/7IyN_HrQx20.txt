well welcome video going looking secant cosecant cotangent function might sound kind strange new really pretty simple concept secant cosecant cotangent reciprocal cosine sine tangent function part keeping track cosecant lot people would think cosecant cos cosine reality sine thats tricky thing secant see box going sec rep going taking inverse sorry reciprocal cosine cosecant limitation times cosine function equal cant divide zero cosine function equal secant going undefined sine function times sine value equal happen cosecant going undefined thing cotangent sine something equal zero tan cotangent going undefined look example cosine degree know thats equal secant degree going equal reciprocal cosine function equal cosine one cosine know cosine going divided leave like simplify going would take reciprocal base denominator thats gon na give us since numerator going one fast way take reciprocal denominator thats going answer let look secant pi dont expect memorize unit circle radian convert degree take times divided get degree degree well dealing secant thats good one cosine degree well know unit circle negative square root answer going reciprocal denominator answer gon na negative square root problem leave square root denominator multiply numerator denominator square root get negative square root numerator square root square root denominator would try another one cosecant degree time dealing cosecant thats going sine degree thats going square root square root going point going take reciprocal denominator answer going two square root two simplify simplify take multiply numerator denominator square root two get square root two two leaving square root two try one cotangent pie remember cotangent thats reciprocal one reciprocal tangent one tangent pi remember tangent found taking sine divided cosine reciprocal would actually two cosine sine going right cosine pi sine pi cosine pi thats cosine sine may memorize cosine negative one sine zero one zero one would undefined well secant cosecant cotangent pretty easy simple concept hopefully understand use remember reciprocal cosine function cosecant reciprocal sine function thats thing otherwise pretty simple good luck assignment lesson secant cosecant cotangent function lesson secant cosecant cotangent function lesson secant cosecant cotangent function lesson secant cosecant cotangent function lesson secant cosecant cotangent function lesson secant cosecant cotangent function lesson secant cosecant cotangent function lesson secant cosecant cotangent function lesson secant cosecant cotangent function lesson secant cosecant cotangent function lesson secant cosecant cotangent function lesson secant cosecant cotangent function lesson secant cosecant cotangent function lesson secant cosecant cotangent function lesson secant cosecant cotangent function
