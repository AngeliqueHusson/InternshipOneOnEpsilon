all right Austinhere 's their road there 's a kind of deepquestion for you we 're saying I is equalto the square root of negative one wesay that number does n't exist right youca n't think of any two numbers thatmultiply to you the square root ofnegative one right so it 's kind of rightit 's kind of a heartless thing so we sayit 's gon na equal I it equals thisimaginary number we call I now if I saideight divided by four you know that 4divides into 8 two times right whatabout if I said 8 I so how many timesdoes an imaginary number that doesn'teven exist how many times that dividingto eight there 's a common question rightwell what we want to do in mathematicsis we do n't really want to leave ananswer we do n't really want to leave ananswer or even to apply something likethisall right because really you 're tryingto think of an imaginary number how manytimes it 's divided into a whole numberMallory and that just kind of brings upa whole different like other questionsof you know how can we even like explainthat or really what 's going on so onething that we know the only thing thatwe know about our I that 's helped us outis we said I squared is we know thatthat can represent negative that canrepresent negative 1 right correct allright so what we want to do is whenwe 're we already talked about addingsubtracting and multiplying complexnumbers but what about when we want todivide complex numbers what exactly wedo because how do you divide somethingthat 's imaginary into something elsewell the thing is what we 're not goingto do is we 're not going to actuallydivide it we 're actually just going tosimplify the expression so rather thanactually saying figuring out some kindof number that this divides into whatwe 're gon na do is we 're gon na simplifyit so to simplify it what you 're goingto do is if I multiply the top and thebottom by I over I now is that okay todo can you just multiply any fraction bysome number on top and bottom I don'tknow let 's take to force you know 2/4 isa the same thing as 1/2 right what if Imultiply by 3 over 3it still gives the same thing so do youthink it 's okay then if I multiply thisby I of rye yeah but we have itrepresented by I which is okay right soif I multiply this by I over I I nowapply the strated property and I get 8minus 6i squared all over 3 I squaredbecause of every got them all think ofthis is like a variable you know x times8 would be 8x so I times 8 is 8 sorry isorry well I 'm just one at a time yeahyeah so you got ta multiply times both ofthese terms up top and then you multiplyon the bottom why 'd I do why did I dothis okayso the reason why I multiplied by I ofrye and not 2 over 2 or 3 over 3 isbecause what happens is you multiply byI of our I look at what you now obtainyou now obtain I squared and do we knowwhat I squared represents the negative 1so now I have 8 I minus 6 times negative1/3 times negative 1 so just by doingthis we came up to this question Idivide it into 8 that did n't really makesense with us right because you get animaginary number as your divisor itdoes n't really make sense to divideimaginary number into something but bymultiplying it by I over I do I now havean imaginary number on my denominator noI have just negative 1 because wemultiply I over I created I squaredwhich now gives us negative 1 now I cansimplify this so I have 8i plus 6divided by negative 3 okay and the lastthing we just need to know is we haven'treally gone through it we 'll talk aboutit a little bit later but complex formof numbers is 8 plus bi so the finalanswer for this would be you 're gonnaseparate this into 8i divided bynegative 3 plus 6/ negative three so your final answer isgoing to be negative two minus 8i /three we 're going we have n't really goneinto writing complex numbers in thecomplex form but this is your standardcomplex form we do n't want to finishyour answer like this we like to writeit in a plus bi format so what you do isyou take your divisor divide it intoboth terms and when I do that I cansimplify this 6 divided by negative 3 isnegative 2 and I ca n't simplify 8i overnegative 3 so I just write it like thatyepany last questionsyou mean using square root of negativeone instead of I Algebra 2 - Dividing complex numbers by multiplying by i, (8-6i) / 3i Algebra 2 - Dividing complex numbers by multiplying by i, (8-6i) / 3i Algebra 2 - Dividing complex numbers by multiplying by i, (8-6i) / 3i
