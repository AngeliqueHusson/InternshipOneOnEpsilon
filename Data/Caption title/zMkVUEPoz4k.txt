this video is going to explore theexterior angle theorem in particularwe 're going to be looking at the highschool exterior angle theorem since theexterior theer angle theorem is actuallya little bit different than what wetypically describe in our high schoolcourses in this problem we 're going tobe attempting to find angle X given twoangles inside the triangle now theexterior angle theorem come from comesfrom Euclid 's elements and what itstates is that any exterior angle in atriangle is greater than either of theopposite angles so in this case we cansee pretty clearly or pretty quicklythat angle X is definitely larger than85 degrees as well as 65 degrees in highschool we tend to call this exteriorangle theorem something slightlydifferent or a little bit moreparticular and we 'll show you what wemean by that right now if we look atthese three angles in particular and ifwe drag them to the sidewe can actually take a look at whatthese angles look like in relation tothe exterior angle so I 'm just going todo a little bit of manipulating torotate just to show you that theopposite the two interior oppositeangles actually equal the exterior angleas you can see here and therefore we cansay that X is equal to 85 degrees plus65 degrees or the two opposite interiorangles to the exterior and therefore Xmust be 150 degrees now we should alsonote that this will work for any of theexterior angles so if we 're referring tothe exterior angle Y then I would beadding the opposite interior angles to Ythe same could be said for Zed addingthe opposite interior angles to Zed Exterior Angle Theorem (High School EAT) | Two Opposite Interior Angles Add to the Exterior Angle Exterior Angle Theorem (High School EAT) | Two Opposite Interior Angles Add to the Exterior Angle Exterior Angle Theorem (High School EAT) | Two Opposite Interior Angles Add to the Exterior Angle
