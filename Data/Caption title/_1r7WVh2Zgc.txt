hey there everyone welcome back tomashup math my name is Anthony and thankyou again so much for joining me on thismini lesson just go ahead and getstarted [ Music ] hey there everyone thank you so much forjoining me on this lesson where we aregoing to explore how to find the lengthof objects using a tool called a rulernow let 's start by thinking about one ofmy favorite things in the whole worldfood so let 's imagine a sandwich that is1 foot long now you probably alreadyknow that one foot is exactly the samething as 12 inches they are twodifferent units of measurement and if wecut this sandwich directly down themiddle in half we know that each halfwould be 6 inches longand for this lesson we are going toexplore using a ruler that has that samelength of six inches and we 're going totake a look at what the symbols andmarkings on the ruler mean and how wecan use them to measure different sizeobjectsso let 's take a look at the side of theruler that 's labeled in inches and youcan determine that by looking for thewords inch or I n as an abbreviationnotice the large numbers one through sixare labeled on the ruler each of thesespots is a value of one inch in lengthso the distance between 0 & 1 is equalto one inch a distance between zero andtwo is equal to two inches which can beexpressed as 2i n the distance between 0and 4 would be equal to 4 inches butwhat would happen if we 're measuring adistance that falls somewhere in betweentwo of these values notice that there isa marking directly in between each oneinch marker on the ruler and each ofthose markings are going to represent1/2 so in this case we have a length of4 and 1/2 inchesnow what if we push our measurement alittle bit further so that it 's inbetween a whole number and a 1/2 in thiscase we 're in between five and five anda half but marking it in between thesevalues are each worth one quarter so inthis case we have a measurement of fiveand one quarter inches or five and 1/4and if we push our length a little bitfurther so that it 's in between one halfand the next whole number we canconclude that this length is equal tofive and three quarters or five andthree fourthsso now that you have a betterunderstanding of using a ruler to findthe measure of a length let 's gain somepractice using a ruler to measure somedifferent items so let 's start off byfinding the height of this piece ofcandy we could start by turning thefigure on its side and taking our rulerand lining it up so that the zero inchmark is aligned with the left edge ofthe figure and seeing how far along itgoes on a ruler to the right edge of thefigure in this case this piece of candyhas a length of one and a half inches ohyeahnow let 's see if we can find the lengthof this inchworm again we can take ourruler and line up the 0 inch mark withthe left edge of the figure and seeinghow far along the ruler it extends tothe right edge in this case three andone quarter inchesnow what about an object like a videogame controller again we want to use ourruler to find them blank of this objectso we can line our ruler up on the leftedge at the zero inch mark and we seethat this object is longer than sixinches so first we measure the first sixinches of the object and then we have tomeasure the length of the extra space todo that we can slide our ruler over andsee if this figure extends in extrathree quarters of an inch so we canconclude that the video game controllerhas a length that measures six andthree-quarters of an inch so this shouldget you comfortable now with using aruler to find the length of measurementof different objects so you might wantto go back and re-watch this lesson afew more times and continue practicingusing your ruler as you continue toexplore measurement and different topicsin mathematics and I thank you again somuch for stopping by I hope you have funand I 'll see you all next time all rightso that 's it for this lesson thank youagain for stopping by I hope you foundit helpful and if you did please clickthat link below and subscribe to our YouTube channel leave a thumbs up and acomment on this video you can really useyour support and also do n't forget tosign up for our weekly newsletter whenyou join our mailing list you get a freeebook download as well as weeklyresources tips insights and some coolconcepts and giveaways as well so don'tmiss out on that the link on this pageyou can click to join the mailing listand that 's all you have to do so thankyou so much again for stopping by andfor all your support and I will see youall next time test
