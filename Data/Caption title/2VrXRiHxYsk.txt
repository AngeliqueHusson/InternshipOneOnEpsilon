a proportion is to equal ratios you canalso think of it as two equal fractionsand you guys already know a lot aboutfractions for example let 's say I wereto write five sixths is equal to 10 12you guys know those are equivalentfractions and in case you forgot let mejust remind you that i multiply 5 by 2in order to get 10 and i multiply six bytwo in order to get 12 that 's how i knowthose are the same quantity the samefraction sometimes with proportions yousee two equal ratios written like this alot of times you 're going to have avariable where instead of telling youthat was 12 they would ask you to findout what it is that 's something you'regoing to run into a lot so when you'regiven a problem like this there 's acouple different ways to solve the firstway is the way i just described to youwhere you think about how 5 times 2 gaveyou the answer 10 so 6 times 2 wouldhave given me that 12 that 's one way tothink about it is to look for whatnumber you 're multiplying by another wayto look at it is to do what 's calledcross multiplying and cross multiplyingis where you multiply the diagonalquantities and set the products equal toeach other let me say that one more timeyou multiply the diagonal quantities andset the products equal to each other sohere we go 5 times X that 's my firstproduct it 's going to be equal to 6times 10 and you can kind of do in yourhead how this would give you the answerx equals 12 so cross multiplying isanother good technique for solvingproportions the last method I want toshow you is the one that makes mostsense to me mathematically let me writethat same problem what I would want todo is try to undo what 's happening to Xjust like I would with solve or Sunnisolving an equation so right now I have10 divided by X if I wanted to get X outof the denominator i would multiply bothsides of the equation by X so that thosecancel out and thenI 'd be working with the problem 5 x / 6equals 10 and from there you would gothrough and either x six fifths which isthe reciprocal of this or you canmultiply in two different steps x 6 over1 so you have 5x equals 60 and thenfinally divide both sides by 5 to see xequals 12 this way is the longest butit 's the most mathematically precise alot of students jump right to crossmultiplying because I think it 's prettyeasy and you 're right it is probably theeasiest method but you have to make surethat you understand cross multiplying isreally doing this process in fewer stepsso when you guys come with a purportscome across a proportion which is twoequal fractions think about which methodyou want to use whether it 's looking forwhat 's the number you 're multiplying byto get from one fraction to the nextwhether you choose to cross multiply orto do it out using solving techniqueslike this test
