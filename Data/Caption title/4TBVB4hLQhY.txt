Add and simplify the answer and write as a mixed number.So we have two mixed numbers here.We have a whole number part and a fraction part.We need to add them.Now , there 's two ways to do this.You could convert both of these into improper fractions , then add them , and then convert that backinto a mixed number.Or you could just look at this and say , well , you know what ? 17 and 2/9 is the exact same thing as 17 plus 2/9 , and then5 and 1/9 is the exact same thing as 5 plus 1/9 , so 17 2/9plus 5 and 1/9 is the same thing as 17 plus2/9 plus 5 plus 1/9.These two statements are completely equivalent.And we know that when you're just adding a bunch ofnumbers , it does n't matter what order you do it in , soyou can swap the order.So you could say that this is the same thing as 17 plus 5plus 2/9 plus 1/9.And we could do this in any order.And we know what 17 plus 5 is.We 've done that before.17 plus 5 is 22 , so that part right there is 22.So we have 22 plus -- now what is 2/9 plus 1/9 ? Well , they have the same denominator , so it 's going tobe over 9 , and then you add the numerators.2 plus 1 is 3.So it 's 22 plus 3/9 , but this can be simplified.Both the numerator and the denominator aredivisible by 3.Divide the numerator by 3 , you get 1.Divide the denominator by 3 , you get 3.So this is 22 plus 1/3 , which is the exact same thing as 22and -- let me write it in that other blue color -- which isthe exact same thing as 22 and 1/3 .
