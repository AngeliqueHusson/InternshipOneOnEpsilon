music hey guy robin lev today going talk polynomial long division let get going talk base x machine base machine base still math even dont know base well call base x first column one column next home x squared column x cube column write number one x squared two x two thats polynomial far guy seen base one youve seen base base five youve seen thing dont know base say could idea gon na let base x base x example first box box second box x box third box x squared box going box one degree would cube x fourth x fifth polynomial x squared plus three x plus two divide polynomial x plus show gon na look box put two dot represent plus two x box gosh weird say x box worry gon na put one works like point like youve already learned division fancier youd find pattern bottom top youd replace blue dot see x plus two thats single dot two dot find pattern youd show like replace blue dot get rid guy get right right yeah dont forget find guy sput one right since theres one x box one box x plus x squared plus plus divided x equal x plus seem like cheating especially youve already experienced polynomial division long division synthetic division cheating math try tip cube plus three x squared minus x minus three going dividing x plus three every time see x plus three going change x plus place dont weve another negative replace answer x cube plus squared minus x minus divided divided x plus x squared minus right much bigger problem see yeah done baby stuff alright let get going theres one new thing see theres dot box theres x x plus x x cube like plus x cube plus squared plus x plus divided x squared plus pattern found replace blue guy ready oh theres fifth plus cube plus plus plus divided x squared plus equal cube plus yeah theyre basic polynomial division hope watching video definitely try home also thing learn division theres problem comes going fix future video bye guy thanks polynomial division base polynomial division base polynomial division base polynomial division base polynomial division base polynomial division base polynomial division base polynomial division base polynomial division base polynomial division base polynomial division base polynomial division base
