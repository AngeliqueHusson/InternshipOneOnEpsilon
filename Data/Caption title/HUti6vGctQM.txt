A common misconception in statistics is to think that correlation implies causation â€ “ like , if more tall people have cats , you might think that means being tall makes people more likely to get a cat . However , simply knowing a correlation between height and cat ownership canâ€™t tell us which way the causality goes â€ “ it may instead be that having a cat causes people to grow taller â€ “ or perhaps the real cause is something else altogether , like that the people and cats live on two separate islands , one a lush paradise with enough food for growing tall and feeding pet cats , and the other a wasteland that limits both height and cat ownership . The point of examples like this is that noticing a correlation between two things doesnâ€™t imply that one of those things causes the other . Hence the common refrain : correlation doesnâ€™t imply causation . And itâ€™s true â€ “ it doesnâ€™t ! But this oft-repeated mantra leads to another common misconception â€ “ the idea that you canâ€™t infer any causality from statistics . You can ! I mean , itâ€™s quite reasonable to think that , if two things are correlated , thereâ€™s likely some reason , , even if a single correlation canâ€™t tell you . Sometimes you can infer the causality from additional information â€ “ like knowing that one thing happened before the other â€ “ but you can also infer causality directly from correlations â€ “ Â you just need more than one , together with something called causal networks . Like , in our cat-height-island example , we know that cat ownership and height are correlated , but we donâ€™t know what the cause of that correlation is . If we donâ€™t know anything else , then there are 19 â€ “ yes 19 ! â€ “ different causal relationships that could explain the situation . 20 if you think the correlation is just an accident . However , perhaps we know two other things : first , suppose people born on a particular island stay there , so their height doesnâ€™t influence what island they live on , and we can rule out the relationships where height influences island . Second , suppose that on either island , taken by itself , there isnâ€™t any correlation between height and cat ownership ; then we can rule out all the options where height and cats influence each other directly . This leaves us with just two options : either the islands are the causal explanation for both height and cat ownership ( maybe , as before , one island is a lush , healthy paradise for both people and cats ) , or else cat ownership is the causal explanation for the islands which are the causal explanation for height , ( like , maybe an abundance of cats turned the island into a paradise , thereby influencing the height of future cat owners ) . So , starting with 19 possible causal relationships , we used correlations to narrow things down to just 2 options â€ “ not bad ! Of course , this is just a simple example , but for any group of things , you can use the various correlations between them ( or lack of correlations ) to eliminate some of the possible cause-and-effect relationships . And thatâ€™s how correlations CAN imply causation . There is one problem , thoughâ€¦ some experiments in quantum mechanics have correlations that rule out ALL possible cause and effect relationships . Weâ€™ll have to save the details for a later video , but until then , may I suggest a new version of the famous refrain ? â€œCorrelation doesnâ€™t necessarily imply causation , but it can if you use it to evaluate causal models . â€¦Except in quantum mechanics.â€ Iâ€™ve got a little more about statistics and causality after this , but first Iâ€™m excited to introduce the very relevant sponsor for this video : Brilliant.org . Brilliant is a problem solving website designed to help you practice and learn math and science via guided problems , puzzles and quizzes : I know that sounds kind of nerdy , but the truth is that the only way to truly learn and understand much of math and physics is to actively work through the material yourself â€ “ videos only get you so far . And Brilliant does a brilliant job of making that easy , sneakily enticing you into doing math and physics problems by means of intriguing questions structured for all ability and knowledge levels . I say this from experience , because if you havenâ€™t done a problem for a few days , Brilliant will send you an attention-grabbing puzzle , and Iâ€™ve been sucked in by quite a few of them . If you want to try out Brilliant ( which I recommend ) , heading to brilliant.org/minutephysics will let them know you came from here , and you can check out their courses on Probability , the Physics of the Everyday , Classical Mechanics , Gravitational Physics and so on . Hey , glad youâ€™re still here â€ “ in case youâ€™re interested , thereâ€™s a footnotes video covering a few things that got cut out of this one , like feedback loops and correlations that arise just by chance . The linkâ€™s on screen and in the video description .
