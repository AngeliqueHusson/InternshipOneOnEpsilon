episode sup ported everywhere somewhat surprisingly mathematical study probability relatively recently trouble gambler mathematician help let start word probability probabilistic derived probabilist primarily used morally evaluative term something worthy approval probable doctor trustworthy one recently probabilist express tentative something like intuition opinion probably go fashion soon course say something probable statement factual knowledge analytic reasoning throughout much human history people consciously intentionally produced randomness frequently used dice dice shaped animal random object gamble entertainment predict future communicate despite engagement control led people n really think probability mathematical term prior ingredient people rigorous series geometry algebra ability rig game dice would certainly provided incentive study probability little evidence thought randomness mathematical mid century rigorous probabilistic reasoning everywhere correspondence pier deform response gambler question often first formal inquiry probability theory aversion wrote ray rusty boring gambling game round flip coin ray get point tail point first person game pot agreed would get get interrupted either player hundred point fairly split fairness one use example could split evenly person point take suggestion player winnings based current score probability winning check link description contribution probability theory diverse many correspondence aleatory meaning related chance dice luck likely kind calculation would expect introductory probability course fought much broadly famous wager utilize different notion probable one thats epistemic certainty uncertainty knowledge wagering betting existence god calculation sort making bet believe god exist reap god n exist n cost much believe n lose much false belief therefore included rational god exist different notion probability century working formalize vary ing degree success next hundred probability accumulate unlike field mathematics develop ing probability theory n arise foundation definition used somewhat scattered theory probability mathematical discipline axiom sin exactly way geometry algebra mean defined element studied basic relation exposition must based exclusively axiom independent usual concrete meaning relation quote theory probability essentially achieve exactly rigorous axiomatic basis mathematical probability approximate analogy word square reference two dimensional shape four three dimensional shape right angle number number written x squared like tool used compute right angle solid hearty meal boring old fashioned person noun form study ing asquare none relevant abstract square consequence basically axiom govern square important axiom motivate intuitive understanding geometry use intuition reasoning mathematically important rigor mathematics able appeal astrict logical foundation exactly axiom attach mathematize probability branch math known measure theory measure mathematical notion size take intuition volume generalize probability comes two question like likely pair dice show nine continuous like question established basis probability theory measure grounds discrete let explore concept literal case throwing dart board dart infinitesimally small meaning exactly point mathematical convenience made radius dart board one square root pi area really bad darts dart equally likely land board basically throwing blindfolded count darts actually land board whats probability hit section dartboard one half area entire dartboard one area section one half probability fraction total area whats probability hit section one quarter section still fraction total area case also one quarter probability point zero area single point zero something seemingly paradoxical entirely possible hit point probability zero saying something probability imply impossible every point dartboard probability zero dart must hit point fact even countable collection point dart area zero probability point rational zero previous example throwing wildly dart board equally likely hit point scalled uniform measure area uniform across dart board uniform measure probability associated region area region divided area entire dart uniform measure entire real number line course throw sare n uniform practice higher probability hit ting closer aim let say always aim center quarter time dart land inside section anda quarter time dart land section land half time instead thinking different dartboard modify way think area dart board different measure way heavily weight dartboard make inside part likely land bigger throw dart blindly dart board probability hit ting colored throw dart original dart board practice darts growing center dart board want mathematically study dart skill calculate average throw probability hit ting center ring twice rowet c study someone throwing blindly start board math probability laid reflected large rand smaller example dart throw random variable return specific value hundred center next ring zero outside ring random variable limited amount information give case value ring land sin random variable n tell exactly ring realize everything every purely mathematical question probability phrase term question sizes measure modern paradigm mathematical probability rooted measured theory axiomatic structure theory probability many different intellectual appeal probabilistic like whether rational bet god existence many intelligent exist universe whether defendant guilty innocent question scientifically philosophically rationally many question mathematically measure theory part personally love probability connection probable scientific understand world filled randomness unknown favorite aspect probability theory let us know comment see next time thanks square space supporting episode whether need domain web site store square space help make next move square space provide san inone platform allow easily set nothing install patch upgrade ever focus important thing like beauty equation magic fundamental theorem calculus free trial square space slash infinite series enter offer code infinite get first purchase thanks great comment episode structural balance brought really good point wan ted guy first point happen graph number people use six people broke two group three n two group different sizes could five one graph ten people hundred people fine another point brought often real life sort ambivalence toward somebody else neither friend maybe would make sense three type edge neither true good point would model real life better would also make graph complicated would make mathematical model complicated could study would different model alsoon different model pointed often feeling arent reciprocal one person friend swith another person enemy people n always feeling could mode led directed graph mean arrow pointing direction someone friend someone else person would different model different way study would different result ton great response challenge really great proof happen weekly structurally balanced complete graph lot graph still split faction two faction every vertex could group could one group n two great proof wan ted say challenge winner week congratulation finally wan ted ask something guy often really mathematics thing want learn topic particularly curious would like hear future episode infinite series us infinite series subject right see next week making probability mathematical infinite series making probability mathematical infinite series making probability
