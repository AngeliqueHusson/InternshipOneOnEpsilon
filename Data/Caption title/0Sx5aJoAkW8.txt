identify hypothesis conclusion following statement determine whether statement always sometimes never true let see statement x well x squared plus plus greater real x first let rewrite proposition statement becomes lot easier identify hypothesis conclusion could rewrite x real true x squared plus plus greater write statement like becomes lot easier identify hypothesis conclusion hypothesis literally part con juring right pink x real number thats hypothesis sometimes cal led antecedent hypothesis said previous video different although related notion dealing hypothesis want confuse much whats inside part statement conclusion conclusion consequent right right conclusion could conclusion statement right right conclusion conclude x real number could say hypothesis right therefor real x hypothesis either way want always easier write statement interesting question whether statement always sometimes never true first thing might pop coefficient highest degree term x squared term positive coefficient going upward opening parabola let draw x axis whether always sometimes never true rest whether vertex whether minimum point parabola draw parabola look like x pick value function value x squared plus always going greater function look like going value x greater going value x equal less determine whether maybe thats value vertex know never true know never true upward opening parabola even vertex negative number eventually get far enough away going get positive value function know never true decide always figure let figure vertex particular value vertex order get value need x value x value vertex theres formula normally dont like giving formula weve shown multiple video negative b cant help look quadratic formula comes straight quadratic formula negative b well ill write negative b plus minus square root b squared minus could write negative b plus minus thing normally see big denominator could split like notice right formula told formula x value vertex make complete sense vertex always going along line symmetry parabola going equal distant get plus direction distance right one plus direction subtract thats make sense negative b line symmetry vertex said let actually figure vertex problem x squared oh sorry negative b equal negative b times thats figure value vertex value well substitute value vertex going equal squared plus times negative finally plus see positive negative squared plus add put everything equal thing equal well know denominator going plus equal positive value positive parabola look something like parabola look something like value x value saw negative minimum point upward opening parabola positive number minimum value positive number always going value level true x real number true always true always true x squared plus plus greater understanding logical statement understanding logical statement understanding logical statement understanding logical statement understanding logical statement understanding logical statement understanding logical statement understanding logical statement understanding logical statement understanding logical statement understanding logical statement understanding logical statement understanding logical statement understanding logical statement understanding logical statement understanding logical statement understanding logical statement understanding logical statement understanding logical statement understanding logical statement understanding logical statement understanding logical statement understanding logical statement understanding logical statement understanding logical statement understanding logical statement understanding logical statement understanding logical statement understanding logical statement understanding logical statement understanding logical statement understanding logical statement understanding logical statement understanding logical statement
