Identify the hypothesis and conclusion of the followingstatement , and determine whether the statement isalways , sometimes , or never true.So let 's see what the statement is.We have x -- well , this should be an x squared plus 5x plus 7is greater than 0 for all real numbers x.So first let 's rewrite this as a proposition , as an if/then statement.Then it becomes a lot easier to identify the hypothesis andthe conclusion.So we could rewrite this as if x is a real number , then this is true.Then , x squared plus 5x plus 7 is greater than 0.And when you write it as an if/then statement like this , it becomes a lot easier to identify the hypothesis andthe conclusion.Now the hypothesis is literally just what the ifpart is conjuring up.So this right here in pink.x is a real number.That 's the hypothesis.Sometimes it 's called the antecedent.That is the hypothesis.And as we said in previous videos , it 's different , although related , to the notion of a scientifichypothesis.Here we 're dealing with the hypothesis of a hypotheticalproposition.Do n't want to confuse you too much.It 's what 's inside of the if part of the statement.The conclusion is the conclusion from the then , orit 's the consequent right here.Then that.That right there is the conclusion.We could have labeled this too.The conclusion here is this statement right here.That right there is the conclusion.That is what you conclude if x is a real number.So you could say for all that is the hypothesis right there.For all real numbers x , that is the hypothesis.Either way you want to do it , it 's always easier to write itas an if/then statement.Now , the more interesting question is whether thisstatement is always , sometimes , or never true.And the first thing that might pop out at you is that thecoefficient on the highest degree term here , on the xsquared term , it 's a positive coefficient.So this is going to be an upward opening parabola.Let me draw that.So if this is the x-axis , whether this is always , sometimes , or never true rests on whether the vertex , whetherthe minimum point of this parabola is aboveor below the x-axis.Let me draw it for you.So if the parabola looks like this , then for any x you pick , the value of the function , the value of x squared plus 5xplus 7 is always going to be greater than 0.If the function looks like this , then you 're going tohave some values for x where it 's greater than 0.But you 're going to have some values for x where it is equalor less than 0.So we have to determine whether it sits above or maybeon or below , the x-axis.And that 's the y-value of the vertex.Now we know that it's not never true.We know that it 's not never true because this is an upwardopening parabola.Even if your vertex is a negative number , eventually , if you get far enough away from it , you 're going to getthe positive values of this function.So we know it 's not never true , we just have to decidebetween always and sometimes.And to figure that out , let's figure out where the vertex -- and in particular , where the y-value of the vertex is.But in order to get that y-value , you need the x value.So the x-value of the vertex , there 's a formula here.I normally do n't like giving formulas , but we 've shown thisin multiple videos before.It 's negative b over 2a.And I ca n't help myself , if you look at the quadraticformula , it comes straight out of that.The quadratic formula is negative b over -- well , I'llwrite it as negative b plus or minus the square root of bsquared minus 4ac.All of that over 2a.Or you could write it as negative b over 2a plus orminus the thing over 2a.You normally just see it with a big 2a in the denominator , but you could split it up like this.And notice , this right here is a formula , I just told youit 's a formula for the x-value of the vertex.Which makes complete sense because the vertex is alwaysgoing to be along the line of symmetry of our parabola.And it is going to be equal distant from each of the 0's.So you get a 0 in the plus direction.This is the distance right here.This is one of the 0 's in the plus direction.And then you subtract , that 's the other 0.So it makes sense that negative b over 2a is thex-value of the line of symmetry or thex-value of the vertex.Now with that said , let's actually figure out what thex-value of the vertex is for this problem.So we have x squared -- oh , sorry.So negative b over 2a.So this is equal to negative 5 because b is 5 , over 2 times 1.Over 2.So that 's the x-value.Let 's figure out where it sits.Whether the y-value for the vertex is belowor above the x-axis.So the y-value , we 'll just have to substitute into this.The y-value of the vertex is going to be equal to negative5/2 squared.Plus 5 times negative 5/2.And then finally , plus 7.Let 's see if this is positive or not.So negative 5/2 squared is 25/4.Minus 25/2 , plus 7.So we can add these.Let 's put everything over 4.So this is equal to 25/4.25/2 is the same thing as 50/4.Minus 50/4.Plus 28/4.This is equal to -- well , we know our denominatoris going to be 4.And you have 25 plus 28 is 53.Minus 50 is 3.So it equals positive 3/4.So the y-value is positive.It is above the x-axis.So the parabola will look something like this.The parabola will look something like this where they-value is 3/4 for the vertax.The x-value we just saw was negative 5/2.And because the minimum point of this upward openingparabola is a positive number , the minimum y-value is apositive number , it 's always going to have values at thatlevel or above it.So this is true.If x is a real number , then it is true.It is always true.It is always true that x squared plus 5x plus 7 isgreater than 0 .
