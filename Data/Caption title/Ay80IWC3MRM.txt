welcome in this video I 'll talk abouttroublesome zero so let 's get a startedby going back to the very beginning ofmathematics in fact if I asked you whatdo you think is the first mathematicalactivity mankind ever took part in youmight think of little moment or twocounting if there 's some historicalevidence for that I 'm in 1937 somearchaeologists moravia uncovered a thewolf of the radius bone of a wolf whichhad notches on it that peered somethinglike this there 's 55 not chosen all ofcourse have n't won 55 or something likethis and they dated this burn to theyear 30,000 BC so we dream about cavemenhere so I found evidence that cavemanwas watching bones in this fashion andthey argue this is actually evidencethat they were counting remember thecounting number Diaz killed in a seasonor number of days past or something Iwas kind of curious that they had fivegroups of five and a group of 30 sitterin random order maybe issues maybe thesegroups came first and they realized thatshe broke through into groups of five itwas actually easy to reuse maybe thatcame second um and it 's kind ofinteresting that they chose groups offive and you might want to think aboutwhat is it about us humans that seem tonaturally think groups of five have anyother number but it is there 's evidencethat may be early mankind was actuallyengaging in counting and in fact thefirst activity young children like toreally engage in mathematically iscounting as well so so what we tend todo historically as a human race seems wewhat we tend to do individually as wellas we go up through through the ages allright so let 's let 's talk about thecounting numbers as how the verybeginning of what seems to be amathematical journey and right therewe 'll get into some pickles what if thatso true to the name the counting numbersother numbers that count things so theyare the numbers 1 2 3 4 5 6 and so onand true their name they really docounting survived right down five maybeI mean five dots live account dots overthe sandbox moving account five piles orsand or maybe one count five flavors ofice cream or maybe five misuses of thewords certain circumspect or somethingyeah so true the name the countingnumbers will count things thinking havedifferent things and with some deepquestions there butter or just leavethat be for the moment but the firstdeep we should want to get to is I'veleft something off this list what do youthink about zeroshould zero be on this list of countingnumbers for example if I say there are 0giraffes in this room is that because Iactually counted 0 drafts or is becauseI 'm just observing a lack of them sodoes 0 count something or not and that'sone of the greatest pickles that thatsort of got mankind befuddled for manymany many centuries in fact so if thatwas until I clean up to the 9th centurythat people was but able to handle thisI was only then that the Indianmathematician started battling thisquestion in a very serious way whatcould net zero mean and what could itsmathematics be but you know it 's a basicquestion is zero counting something andit 's still a question to this day tosome extent because sometimes peoplecall these the natural numbers have youread different texts sometimes theyinclude 0 in the list of natural numbersand sometimes they do n't so this is avariability from textbook to textbook tothis day in fact even todaymathematicians when they write papersand number theory then we 'll talk aboutthe natural numbers though you shouldhave to write a send as the beginning inthis paper we shall consider 0 naturalnumber or in this paper we do n't include0 as a natural number just to cover thebases we 're still actually up in the airabout whether we should include 0 as faras the definition natural numbers or notyeah but there 's the first question is 0accounting number and it actually comesup in two places comes up in one verypractical way for us today compared towhat the Babylonians of 2,000 years bcwere struggling with 4,000 years ago sohere goes let me explain what I meanwhen rewrite numbers we use a base 10system so for example if I wrote thenumber like 5736 I 've got ones I gottens or 10 Squared 's hundreds andthousands we mean 5703 tens and six onesthat 's what we mean while we stringthese digits together the Babylonians atthat time 4000 BC the 4,000 years agoactually used base 60 those they usednot powers of 10 like we 'd reallyespouses 6166 T squared is 3660 cubed iswhat 2016 with three zeros on it and soon they did n't use these hindu-arabicnumerals 135 376 and so on like we dothey used I 'm not going to get quiteright these pretty things on claytablets had little stone things theselittle wedge shapes rather look likethis or maybe morethat and that represent one and theselittle sort of uniform things look likethis and that represent to him so whenthey wrote in a clay tablet somethinglike I 'm just be short hair like thisthis and maybe that I would read that asten ten and one that 's 21 360 300 3000six hundreds plus 10 and 111 60 s plus31 once it 's a whopping big number sothat 's what they wrote so they wanted toexpress the right that number and it ina text of some kind they let you justwrote this all right here comes thepickle maybe want a number like this5022 we would write 5022 here comes ourfirst question what 's the role of thisguy we mean we 've got five thousandswe 've got zero 100 's maybe we'recounting zero hundreds to tens and twoones so maybe in our notation zerosbeing used as a counting number we'reactually counting zero hundreds maybeyou disagree we actually counted fivethousand so why should this havedifferent status all of a sudden somaybe here we use zero as a counternumber the Babylonians were scared ofthat they did n't do it if they wanted towrite one of their numbers and let mesee if I can clean up my little boredhere suppose I wanted to write thisnumber which was simply whoops where'smy pen I 'm go in red one here and a 1there now with my boxes in this diagramof boxes is very clear that 's going torepresent the number one 3601 one theymean 3016 one but what they actuallywrote on the clay tablet they had nosymbol 40 they 're scared of that theyjust wrote symbols they saw and that'sall you saw if you look at that youmight think well maybe this number 20made this number 160 + 1 161 or matesthe number of 3601 and so on what theyrelied on is the reader going by thecontext what they 're reading was allabout for example suppose I read thissentence I know emmys was a very old manbefore we got married he was at the ageof Earth these two little symbols theyfinally got weird well let 's seethat mean to well being married at twodoes n't make sense as not number two itwas even at the age 3601 no no one livesthat long that must mean in that contextthe number 61 or suppose they said thatI know so-and-so was a very fineshepherdess your head a total of thesetwo symbols sheep well let 's see howmany two sheeps probably let fine maybehaving 61 ship is n't that fine maybethey mention it 3601 sheep so in thatcontext I probably think they met thenumber 3000 611 3001 but that 's annoyingits lack of zero not having a zero causesome problems made it difficult the badones actually did quite a serious amountof mathematics but they never use zeroin their work very curious you know butas I said it was until mathematicianslike mahavir on ax and bus car and soforth 8 850 is the first guy up in the11 hundreds of Pescara who r e saidactually goes it is worthwhileconsidering 0 to be a number playing thesame roles numbers like 1 and 7 and 17effect you can even do the same mathwith these numbers to some extent butthen it 's still troublesome and then wetalk about that let 's go through themathematics is zero so suppose let 's goto the audition if I wrote 5 plus 0 whatdo I really mean by that well thecounting numbers accounting somethinglet 's count dots this I guess it meansfive dots on a page there it is it wasfive and I add to that that 's what thatmeans no more dots I guess I 've stillgot five dots on the page or if I didthe seller around zero dots plus fivedots so I were to page with no dots onit then I add to that page five dots Iguess for the geometric see about fivedots in fact if I decide a little bitfunky 0 plus 0 that 's not too scary witha blank page with no dots on it and addto it no more dots I still have no dotsso edition with 0 does n't seem too badmultiplication starts get a bit scary iswhy so first what we mean bymultiplication now at a very basic levelof counting numbers you might argue thatmultiplication can be really argued tobe repeated addition which case theymight say 4 x 37 like four groups ofthree I mean by that I mean 3 + 3 + 3 +3 and get 12 so can we deal it with zerowe s 5 times 0 there will be five groupsof 0 0zero and zero and zero and zero sothey 're just as I do the adding zero isstill zero this must be zero okay I canhandle that here 's where things getfunky 0 times 5 that 's zero groups offive now most people say I forgot nogroups of fire that means I 've gotnothing but I could actually if I reallywant to think deeply I could argue theanswers 3 why can ask the Aggies threewell here 's three dots how many groupsof five do i see i see zero groups offive there 's a group survived yep sirgroups of five that 's my picture ofthree dots maybe glasses for because infour dots ic0 groups of five or maybeelse is one so this is very bizarre whatis 0 times 5 well maybe the way aroundthat is to say well what we like tobelieve is true about how multiplicationshould work for various numbers let'ssee in this case and screen here let'sgo back to 4 times 3 my point is thatpeople like to say that 4 x 3 + 3 x 4should actually be the same answerbecause if you actually draw your dotsus a somatic way here 's four groups ofthree or two of them is a nice lined uprectangle pal cuber 3 same group ofthree third group of three fourth groupof three that 's four groups of three ofa look this way if i turn the picture 90degrees and look this way instead i seethree groups of four which is this guynow that the same pictures the samenumber of dots therefore these twoproblems must have the same answer andof course i 've chosen very easy numbersi know that 12 in each case but ingeneral that 's an argument for sayingwe 'd like to believe that a times Bshould be B times a now that if you wantto play that game as a rule you thinkshould be true for all numbers includingzero if you choose to believe it 's truetwo equals it also zero then maybe theway to deal with this guy which is scaryif I think of it this way to say allright 0 times 5 I believe that rules arethe same as 5 times 0 and I 'm going tohandle on that guy that 's 0 so now I'mgoing to argue 0 times five but also tobe zero that 's quite involved that'squite abstract all right that 's editionthat 's multiplication which at thislevel can be thought of as repeatedaddition if you like and then let 's getto subtraction that means I really needto deal with negative quantitiesnow when I when I teach the stuff if youactually look at vol 1 chapter one of mythinking series book food rule asleep alittle plug of myself and they actuallybite at the sightless really plug it Ireally teacher counting numbers asnegative numbers of piles and holes forexample 5 so having five dots on I havefive piles and if i add to that theopposite of three piles that would belike three holes and what I think ofholdups of the pile was the sand of apile physical hole completely it givesme nothing in this case I can see I'mleft with two piles so in some sense thenegative numbers are the opposites ofwhat i want so if example if i did fivepowers and something to give me back toa nice level playing for your zeropowers and zero holes well what 's theopposite of five would be five holes sothen ask this guy negative zero whatcould that mean and this actually doescome up students will write on a papertheir answer as negative zero you knowit might be an algebra problem i meanprobably more involved in this but ifyou know ask the kid to work outsimplify this guy they might be verytempted to write negative zero and ifit 's a more complicated algebra problemthis sort of thing can and does arise somy question is what is negative zerowell they 're gon na do my powers andholes model maybe you 'll argue this isthe opposite of no piles and no holesinclude the opposite of no piles and noholes is mote holes and no piles so theopposite of nothing a nice flat sand boxis still going to be a nice flat sandbox and maybe negative zero is zero okaythat maybe that 's one way to think aboutthis maybe it 's sort of a more earthmedical way to think about this tojustify is ok I need to know what theopposite of 0 is that is I need to takezero figure out what I need to add to itto get back to zero well some sensorswill be crawling neighbors here in thefirst place the opposite of 0 is thatwhich add 20 to get back to zero but youtold me at the very early on this videothat zero plus zero is zero so she 's 0also fits this bill so there we are twoobjects that fit the same bill maybehave to say that the same thing negativezero it 's the same as 0 now those thatare no really advanced mathematics andepisode algebra is basically say but howdo you know editor in purses are uniquethat 's a good question but you know atan elementary levelmaybe that 's enough the opposite of 0 isthat some number that esta tu gets backto zero but zero works therefore theopposite zero must be 0 itself trickyhard dealing with zero is actually hardin fact it gets very hard when we go tothe next basic arithmetic operationwhich would be division and I have avideo about dividing by 0 c minor watchmight want to watch that I 'll go tofurther detail there but here 's a basicgist of it before a ran out of time 5/0ok how can I make sense of them wellfirst of all how does division work if Isaid 20 divided by two is ten you cancheck yourself by saying ok two times 10is 20 yes that 's right 20 or if I saidsix divided by two is three had I checkmyself two times three is six yes shouldbe six so suppose I i sighs I want tobelieve that 0 divided 5 divided by 0 is3 does it pass my check 20 x 3 equal 5know it equals 0 bother that 's not rightmaybe 5 divided by 0 is seven check 0times seven is that five no it'sactually zero again in fact 5/0 going tobe any number or all right n for anynumber check 0 times and I 'm afraidwe 'll never be five so it always be zeroso this will never work so basically youcan argue 5/0 has no answer let 's notquite the end of the story sometimes youcan divide by 0 what do you think ofthis 0/0 I claim the answer is 7 and howdo I know I 'm right well it passes mycheck because 0 times seven but withthat art is zero look at that it'sexactly right there it is 0 / 0 isactually seven what do you think of thatlet 's keep going watch my video ondividing by zero to get the answer tothis little drool let 's ask them anotherbasic question and some numbers havingto be even some numbers empty odd forexample 8 is even because if i draweight dots six seven eight i can putthem into pairssome sort of nice way or maybe not thisnice way and there 's no dots left overso we call that even and something likeseven is odd so I 'll try to do the samefeat with seven dots basic seven I 'll beleft with I 'm sure you realize oneerrant left over I ca n't splinter nicepairs so here 's my question is zero evenor odd ooh what picture do I draw hmmcan I spit those dots I do n't draw intopairs do I have any left over by oneleft over that 's a very strange questionum in some sense you might want to goback to arithmetic but I say eight iseven as I really means because eight istwo times something on the nose andseven is odd because it 's actually twotimes something but I 'll have one leftover so i guess to answer this questionmay want to do a little moretheoretically does 0 equal to xsomething with either nothing left overnothing le Flo or maybe add one leftover which is it well look at this 0equals 2 times 0 and I do n't have to addone it 's done 0 equals 2 times 0 whichmakes me think that actually it fits thebill of being even just like eight waseven so maybe we should say zero is evendo you agree do you think if it wereedit this is actually good please leadsme to another question that 's zeronumbers have factors for example I couldsay that too is a factor of 20 becauseit was my pen because 20 equals twotimes something that equals 2 times 10but it also tells me 10 as a factor 20because 20 equals 10 times something 10times two in fact for is also a factorand fires a factor of 20 one 's a factorof 20 and 20 is a factor 20 so 20 is thefactors 1 2 4 5 10 and 20 they 're allthe numbers that appear as a productthat gives me 20 in the realm ofcounting numbers so the question is does0have any factors now it 's getting weirdmaybe five is a factor 0 because 0 doesindeed equal 5 times something was 5times 0 so maybe 0 as a factor 5 is afactor actually there for that matter wedid say that 0 equals 0 x 0 I thinkwhich means 0 is also a factor but youalso say the 17s a factor does zero haveevery possible numbers a factor crazyscary or exciting not sure which aboutto run out of time but I also did alovely little video on a 0 to the 0 andthat 's when things get really reallyexciting most people do n't start tothink about this guy maybe talk calculusdays they actually want to analyze thefunction y equals x to the ex butthere 's actually a nice algebra to playwith on this guy because I bet in myvideo on zero to the zeroth power we canargue there the answer of seventeen anda half so I guess my point is zero isjust hard 0 is just tricky tricky trickytricky concept its arithmetic is strangein high school most people say justdo n't go there do n't go to zero in somesense cactus is all about going to theextreme going to the danger zone letthings after to go to zero and try toget meaningful answers nonetheless so nowonder how kids have a lot of troubleeven our young kids and kids do want toask questions like is zero even or oddor 20 have factors they 're actuallynatural questions and I hope that allteachers are willing to contemplatethemselves and it 's fine not to know theanswers but it 's good to want to wonderabout it and what to find out and justplay with it so I wish upon the worldgreat joyful intellectual play ontroublesome concepts even like zeroalright thanks so muchyou test
