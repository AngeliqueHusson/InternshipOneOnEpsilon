welcome first video sadistic video going mean median mode three central foundation statistics really important understand core going use throughout duration course let get star ted right away example hopefully make sense finished let say another need find three central data set mean median mode let find mean commonly known need find average set order find mean add let add add plus plus plus need need divide total amount data set need divide number add plus plus hundred plus numerator denominator equal average mean data set equal alright let median median found first need order theyre already large stand median always number right middle notice number draw two left right exactly middle median equal quick side note meeting little different even set let say notice instead five six drew number trying find number thats right middle notice three right line three left whatever take two middle average together plus divided equal right particular data set median equal right let go back original example right mean found median mode mode occur ill circle number occur red notice every number except occur mode equal found central tendency mean median equal mode equal many people ask question best measure mean better median medium better mode measure central tendency used median mode n exact answer question probably use make lot sense use example let say example measuring weight every day every morning go weight scale measure weight let say one day measure anyway hundred pound sand next day measure anyway next day weigh hundred day also weigh let say fifth say weigh let make really ridiculous let say fifth day right found mean set data would plus plus plus divided five mean would equal data set number right middle hundred median equal mode also going equal hundred number think pretty common sense meeting much accurate measure central tendency mean number obviously inaccurate must error wait scale must sort error way gain one day really affected know obviously weight around mean say weight average even close mean probably measure central tendency use mode much accurate much accurate data use common sense hope video give better idea mean median mode making video standard deviation next stay tuned next one see later statistics mean median mode statistics mean median mode statistics mean median mode statistics mean median mode statistics mean median mode statistics mean median mode statistics mean median mode statistics mean median mode statistics mean median mode statistics mean median mode statistics mean median mode statistics mean median mode
