khan footage hereof one exciting moment sports history make even exciting commentator speaking german assuming k fair use really math problem want watch video ask question cheering commentator speaking german khan see exciting language might watch question fast u sain bolt going average speed right encourage watch video many times need give little bit time think solve figure fast u sain bolt going really thinking case problem average speed average rate might already familiar notion distance equal rate speed write rate times time could write times like start algebra traditional multiplication symbol seem look like variable x instead write times like distance equal rate times time hopefully make intuitive sense rate speed second example necessarily fast went went per second two second hopefully make intuitive sense went went per second two second sand also works times equal second denominator second sup numerator wrote second si wrote also cancel left left hopefully make intuitive sense way let actually think problem hand information actually distance distance video give second two think well race distance meter snow else know know well trying figure rate going figure else know equation right well know time know time time took u sain bolt run give another second think well luckily timing whole thing also sho wed world record right second sit long took u sain bolt run meter sit second sand write given information need attempt give us rate term per second want think could figure rate term per second know distance know time well let substitute equation right know distance meter sand equal n know rate write rate right let write color equal rate times time know time second sand care care rate well look right hand side equation second times rate able divide right hand side second right hand side want solve say well n divide right hand side second cancel dimensional analysis n worry much word n make sense cancel cancel ca n divide one side equation number star ted equal divide right side order equality still true need divide left side thing ca n divide right side divide left side order equality still true said one thing equal another thing divide thing something order still equal divide first thing amount divide right hand side whole point two cancel left hand side divided per second exact want rate speed let get calculator divide got divided point say weve got three significant let say give us write rate per second second equal next question got per second unfortunately per second drive car n see speedometer per second see either kilometer per hour per hour next task express speed rate average speed average rate think term kilometer per hour try figure rewrite kilometer per hour well let take step step going write let go start star ted write blue second magenta want get kilometer per hour right per second let take baby first think term kilometer per second give second think would turn kilometer per second well intuition going per second many kilometer well kilometer much unit measurement times much smaller number kilometer sand particular going divide way think want focus want get rid want want kilometer want get rid numerator could divide would cancel intuitive way think going smaller unit unit going much smaller number look way many meter sare kilometer kilometer equal right kilometer fundamental value essentially multiplying one get well cancel left kilometer second sand get divided divided going give divide going get divide get divide get divided kilometer per second kilometer second right let write equal sign let try convert kilometer per hour give little bit time think one well theres second hour however many kilometer second going times hour also work many second going times second hour another way think want denominator multiply second per hour second per hour second going cancel going left denominator second cancel left kilometer per hour multiply number times get calculator times give us say equal kilometer per hour average speed kilometer per hour last thing want us convert imperial sometimes cal led ironically necessarily used tend used let convert per hour one thing tell case n know kilometer equal mile give little bit time convert per hour well see mile slightly reasonably kilometer going kilometer certain amount time going go slightly smaller amount certain amount time particular going divide let rewrite kilometer per hour going unit going going divide something one one let write blue equal could say one mile per kilometer also works want get rid kilometer numerator would want denominator want mile numerator mile numerator let multiply guess case dividing get let divide previous value get point round equal per hour obviously fast human maybe fast might imagine din car per hour n seem especially relative animal world particularly noteworthy actually slightly charging elephant charging elephant clocked per hour finding average speed rate ratio proportion
