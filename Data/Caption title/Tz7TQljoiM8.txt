get volume surface area let us understand cone right circular cone circular base curved surface one vertex let us understand animation soft ware form cone moving right triangle around axis like cone curved surface circular base line passing vertex center circular base cal led axis right circular since axis perpendicular ground let get back figure let central axis let radius base axis perpendicular base cone hand right circular since axis perpendicular ground henceforth whenever see cone example right circular cone three need understand cone first perpendicular height h second slant height l third radius circular base r first thing notice right triangle formed l squared equal r squared plus h squared tell us know two parameter easily found erase move new page try work surface area cone surface area cone sum two surface one circular base two curved surface radius given area circular base curved surface arent familiar shape curved surface cut look like slightly cut look like sector circle area sector curved surface area cone sum sector circular base equal total surface area need find surface area surface area extremely interesting see next video right circular cone right circular cone right circular cone right circular cone right circular cone right circular cone right circular cone right circular cone right circular cone
