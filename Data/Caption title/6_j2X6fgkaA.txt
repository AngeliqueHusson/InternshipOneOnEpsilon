Hello , calculator fanciers ! A bit of an unusual one today.I have been sent this in by an amateur calculator appreciator.Robert in the United States of America found this in his parents ' basement ! They you are , Robert . I bet you did n't think when you pulled this out and dusted it offthat one day you 'd see it here ! I mean , this is center court , the epicenter of the calculator appreciating world . It just goes to show youeveryone at home , with your little calculator collections , that one day , all your calculator dreams can come true.Okay , so here we have the Casio with an unexpected 'extra'that 's slightly more threatening than I like my calculators to be . But you can see , it has got two color printing , which is two more colors than most.Now , just very quickly , I 'm aware this is officially a historiccalculator , because it 's quite an old one that 's been sent in . And some of you will be concerned that while it isstill in its original box , it 's not mint in its original box . It 's been damaged here , like some kind of heavy blow to the top.There 's some scuffing around the bottom . It is not museum quality.There 's some marks on here . Very disappointing . And from a proper collecting point of view , we do n't know the history of this calculator.It 's got no provenance . I mean there 's no chain that shows where this came from . So I 'm well awarethis is not up to the standards you 'd expect . But , for a bit of fun , I 'm prepared to pop it open and have a closer look.And here we go . This should slide out . And oh , okay . So here we havesome paper for printing . That 's gon na be handy.Here we 've got some of these , with ayellowing tape on them to hold . Maybe it was yellow to start with . Now , for the UK collectorit 's a little inconvenient that the US adapters are 120 volts , or freedom voltage , as it 's commonly referred to.But as a purist , I 'm not gon na swap that out for a replacement one.I want to keep the proper one . The official standard practice is to get an adapter to adapt the adapter to your local situation.So you need to get an adapter adapter , or adapter squared , as we call it . Little joke there from the calculator community.Okay , getting down to the calculator itself . We have , here we go , look at that ! So it 's got a kind of dust cover there . So if it 's in a place with lots of debris that might land on it , you can keep it carefully cased under there , at a moment 's notice.It 's got the full instructions ! Look at that ! And warranty.Now the HR 100 is well known for having the largest broadsheet instruction manual in the business . Look at that ! So the box has got quite a nice look to it . Now , as previously discussed , we ca n't use the US adapterstraightaway , and so we 're going to have to put some batteries in the back of this bad boy . Okay , so it takes fourdouble A batteries.Batteries , please ! Four double A 's . Thank you very much . Now , we 'll pop one in there.It 's always very important to put your batteries in facing the right way around.Otherwise , you will , your calculator can catch on fire , it can explode.Or even worse , you might get the wrong answer to one of your calculations.I 'm afraid I 'm gon na have to give you a gore warning.Look away if you do n't like horrific medical sights , because I 've actually cut my finger opening up this cal- . You can see , look- look at that ! It 's barely attached anymore . I 've cut my digit while trying to get in to use some more digits.I mean that , that 's just the risks I accept when you 're opening calculators at this kind of level.Okay , we just pop that back on there , and now the batteries are in , we will fire this thing up to on ! All right , so this is just basic calculator mode . So let 's do , we 'll do the standard divide by zero.One divide by zero equals ... tiny tiny error over there . Does n't make a big deal of it . That 's quite nice . And , we 'll do a quick divisionprecision ... does that clear ? One , oh , it 's locked . Clear.Oh , okay . We 're clear , here we go , okay . Let 's do one divided by nine , equals.All ones , times nine , equals.So you can see there , not entirely accurate , which is quite goodif you 're trying to fudge the books to have a little bit of wiggle room in your calculations.And finally you got 'feed ' over here . So , obviously , when you 're doing your accounts , you 'll be working around the clock . If you do have to go and get some sustenance , you can just hit 'feed'.Oh ! Oh my goodness ! Oh , so no , feed is for the printer ! And you know what ? That is why we 're here.We want to see the printing in action . Let 's load up the paper . Just tidy up the edgethereOkay , so the paper goes , obviously , on the back here , so we 'll shove it in there , and then hit 'feed'.Come on . Take it . Here we go ! Okay , now we 're ready to do some calculations while it prints . So if I do one , plus , I 've committed the one to the paper now . No going back.Two , plus , four , plus , eight , plus , sixteen , you can see , as I 'm adding these numbers on , they 're all being printed up there . We 're up to 62 , plus124 , plus 248 , and now if we want to get the grand total , you hit star.And there it 's printed at the bottom . And if we feed that up , you can see , there 's my whole calculation , and then , you know what ? You can you can then cut that off there.If you want to do a calculationand send it to someone else , incredibly convenient , a little souvenir , send it off , everyone else can enjoy it.Okay , so let 's do some tests while we 're printing ! One , divided by , zero , equals.Oh , there , see , it 's done a full line . You can see that it 's not happy.It 's done , no , no , no no no . Clear that . If I do one , divided by , super zero , so double zero , and it goes , and , still no . Very very unhappy with that.Let 's clear that out . Okay , let 's tryseeing how it does with undoing division.So , one , divided by , nine , equals , and so there we 've got , very , loads of ones , very good . Now , we 'll multiply thatby nine , equals.No , not quite . That 's very disappointing.What is this ? All right , so very knowingly , it tries to do it , and it did n't get back to one . So , then this is now a little monument to its shame.You can keep that . Right , you can , you can be like , '' Look what you 've done ! That is very disappointing . I 'm very upset with you . `` Very rarely can you show a calculator what it 's done incorrectly like that.Now one of the great things about a printing calculator , if you 're doing a calculation , like you put in fifty eightthousand , and you add , eight , right , and then you want to get the grand total for that , once it 's printed out , you can feed it all the way through . And normally you 've got to pick the calculator up and move it around.Because it 's a printing calculator , nothing has to go anywhere , and you can still turn the answer around.So very quickly , we 'll just check how big the display is . We 've got one two three four five six seven eight , nine digits ! ten , eleven , twelve , no thirteen.It hits an error at thirteen , but it does display big twelve digits , that 's quite nice.And if you want , if you want , you want to keep as a reminderof just how many digits you 've got , of course you can print that out , and there you are.In fact , on there are more than twelve things on the display , because you 've got all the nice fancycurly commas . Look at those ! Good typography . You 've got an overly sized decimal point , there 's a space , and a plus.I mean that , that is a good display.So there you are . The Casio unexpected extra twelve digits , two color printing , big display , printing calculator.Model number HR dash 100 TE plus negative W , adapter included.Now , obviously , I 'm just doing this is a bit of an exhibition piece . It 's a bit of fun for the fans at home.I ca n't give it a proper score . So there you are , Robert.Thank you very much for sending this in . And thank you for being an inspirationto everyone else getting into the calculator game . Who would have thought that a calculator you found in thebasement in the United States that would one day end up here at the South Surrey and Associated RegionsCalculator Appreciation Society for Professionals and Amateurs ? test
