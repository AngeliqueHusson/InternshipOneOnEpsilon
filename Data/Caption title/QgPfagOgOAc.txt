now this is just a brief introduction tocongruence -- is that is if you like thearithmetic of remainders so that you canuse these in solving certain problemspost a bit of terminology about adivision which of course will result inour remainder and that is if I put thisdown if I take some number and divide itby some other number that will go in acertain number of times and thenthere 'll be something left over or justput remainder to program each of theseparts has got a name the number you'redividing by is the divisor the numberyou are dividing it into as the in thiscase is the dividend maybe more aware ofthat in terms of that which is to beshared out the dividend the number oftimes it goes in in other words thenumber of times you can take n out of itis Q which is called the quotient and ifthere 's anything left over about P Rwhich is the remainder and is this thinghere the remainder which conferences areall about with respect to this numberthey are dividing by these are givenother names signify that the divisor isknown as the modulus of this calculationor provide a remainder and the simplestremainder has also known as the residuewhich off obviously just means was leftover another piece of notation if theremainder is zero that means n dividese-exactly annotation for that is this nwith a vertical stroke an e means ndivides a the publication B and ofcourse that 's exactly an example dividedby three if I take 16 and divided bythree that 'll go in five times and giveme a remainder of one so you could seehere the number 16 with respect todivisioni N and the what-for that uses this 16module or in this case it 's 3 is equalto 1 meaning module meaning theremainder with respect to division bywhatever it says there are 3 similarlyif I pick another number like 40 40divided by 3 would go in there 10 timesand also have a remainder of 1 and thisis where the congruence is come in nodethere 's another piece of notation that'sused here as far as / 3 is concernedthese two numbers are the same to itbecause all that produces is thisremainder of 1 at the end as far as theremainder with respect to divisionsconcerned as far as as module isconcerned they both give 1 they 're bothidentical in that respect so you canrate this you can rate 40 and it 's notgoing to be 40 is equal to 60 increasesobviously not your 840 it 's congruent to16 now it 's only congruent to 16 andrespect of this division with respect to3 so in brackets afterwards you wouldrate modulo 3 nicely classic statementsand congresses these two here areequivalent and the sense that they givethe same remainder with respect to thedivision by 3 and that simplestremainder is 1 so you could write 40 iscongruent to 1 mod 3 and that 's thesimplest remainder that 's the residuethat has to be less than the dividingnumber so rating this so this would beread as 40 is congruent to 1 normally tosee MoIT that 's actually modulo 3 heysome rules for congresses take a coupleherea number a is congruent to B mode somenumber other and another number C iscongruent to D mode that same basenoting that here there are no fractionsinvolved these are all going to beintegers a B C D and n are all going tobe integers integers in particularpositive integers if is the case thenthere are three worthwhile ones toremember if is content to B and C iscompared to D that means as far as thisis concerned this divisions concernedboth of them would give the sameremainder these two look have the sameremainder which will be different fromthese two in general then the first oneis a plus C in other words adding twonumbers is congruent to B plus D modemthese do n't necessarily need to be theresidues the smallest values but what itsays effectively as the remainder of thesum is equal to the sum of theremaindersthat 's the addition and subtraction boxas well so there 's addition andsubtraction principle to any multiple ofe is congruent to the same multiple of Bthe remainder of the multiple equals themultiple of the remainder and the thirdone the multiplication a times C will becongruent to B times D mode in theremainder of the product equals aproduct of the remainder that 's a veryuseful one because there 's one that canbe two powers of numbers the remainderafter division into a power of a numberokayas an illustration of the first one theaddition and subtraction principle thatis the remainder of the sum should havesaid or difference equals the sum ordifference of the remainders or justpick a couple of numberswe 'll take 45 and we 'll take 18 andwe 'll take them both division withrespect to 5 so I 'll be mod 5 well 5into that we 'd go remainder 2 so that'scongruent to 2 mod 5 18 dividing by 5would be 3 remainder 3 are congruent to3 mod 5 now adding 47 and 18 would giveyou 50 65 so what 's 65 congruent to ordividing that by 5 because an exactlythat 's congruent to 0 mod 5 so how doesthat tie in with this principle if youadd the numbers then you get theaddition of the remainders or put itdown so the current statement here wouldbe if that and that is the case then 47plus 18 should be congruent to 47 iscongruent to 2 18 is compared to 3 whichis 5 but since I 'm taking mod 5 welldrop down again to 0 mod 5remainder of the sums is cognate to thesum of the remainders then anillustration of the second onemultiplying by some fixed number youcould combine it with one to produce alinear combination of these two so thatfor instance I could take three of themand two of them what would happen thento the remaindersthere 's 177 so try that 177 is congruentto seize it when divided by five isconfident to to mode five how does thatcompare to this expansion this says thatthree times forty seven plus two times18 which is of course the same as thisshould be congruent to 3 times the 47which is 2 plus 2 times whatever 18 wasconcurrent to which was 3 mod 5 9 6 & 6which comes to 12I 'll just put there do it again suchcongruent to 12.5 and of course dividedby 5 takes that down to 2 remainder of 2same result now over the last one theprinciple for multiplication theremainder of the product is equal to theproduct of the remainders tested forthis here 47 times 18 is it for 6 now 8for 6 is congruent a little bit 1leftover divided by 5 is congruent to 1mod 5 now 47 times 18 should beconcurrent to 2 times 3 which is 6 and 6is concurred to mine the one left overwhen you debate 6 by 5 themultiplication principle because thatwould also extend two powers if 47 iscongruent to 2.5 then x 47 would beequivalent to multiplying by 2 whichmeans any power of 47 would be acongruent to any purpose in power of 2that 's not quite so useful because you'dhave to walk over this link into it doesbecome useful when you 've got somethingwhich is congruent to one so forinstance 19 is congruent to 1 not mod 5pick a different one mode namewhich means 19 to the power n any powerwill be cognate to 1 to the power nwhich means 19 is congruent to 1 mod 9for any power 19 to the power n iscongruent to one might namecontinuing with the powers then and thiswas what will lead to Fermat 's littletheorem if e is cognate to B then e tothe N will become going to be to the endno such change this turn mod M no X Iwant to use n for powers which is onthere really useful when is congruent to1 because then this just turns down intoa little number until 1 but it turns outthat if M is a prime number if you takemodulo P where P is prime then e to thepower P is congruent just to e itselfwithout any power there so that forinstance 3 to the 11 mod 11 in otherwords if you mark out 3 to the power 11and then divide by that by 11 theremainder should be 3 just checking that3 to the power 11 as one seven seven onefour seven dividing that by 11 gives you16 1 or four point two seven to sevenand of course you recognize that patternof digits that 's named threes so it 's aremainder three and of course the factsgreater then you would just take themodulo again if it 's something like nameto the power 7 well I should becongruent to 9 mod 7 powers are primenumber but of course nein mod 7 would becongruent all the way down to 2 so thatsays dividing 9 to the power 7 by 7should give a result resulting remainderof- 9 ^ 7 is 4 7 8 - 9 6 9 dividing thatby 7 gives you a whole bundle of numbersbut point 2 8 5 cent and so on andthat 's the second that citizenessremainder - from this the statementthat 's known as fair max little theoremit is e to the P minus 1 is congruent to1 mod p we have a NP are co-prime thislittle bracket here stands for thehighest common factor of the numbers aNP and if the co-prime they do n't shareany factors so the highest common factorshould be 1 if NP are co-prime that isthey do n't share any factors no factorsin commonif NP are co-prime that means that e tothe P minus 1 should be congruent to 1mod p that 's Fermat 's little theoremwhich can be useful in some problemsolving so that for instance nein if I'mgoing to do something mode 7 9 and 7local train name to the power 6 sothat 's one less than this plain numbershould be congruent to 1 which you cancheck for yourself when you divide thatnumber by 7 you do in fact get 1 thehandy thing here of course is sometimesthose numbers you have n't got access tobecause they become so big if thatcongruence applies then so does namedthe per 6 raised to any polar wouldstill be congruent to 1 because 1 to anypower remains at 1 and that 's the usefulone for it finding the remainder ofhuge numbers as an example horseremainder when 3 to the power 1 2 3 isdivided by 11yeah no problem I 'll just take that endand see whether the mins it is 3 to thepower 1 2 3 is whoops gobbet there yougofar too many digits you have to fit anfit on it so I 've no idea what they areat the end so I can actually divide thatby 11 but I divided by 11 I 'll stillhave no idea of what I 've got at the endso that 's where Fermat 's little theoremis going to come in handy if I 'm Daveleading by 11 which is a plain number soif I 'm going to do modulo 11 andthreescore primes that should work finethat means three to the 11 minus 1 3 tothe power 10 should be congruent to Wyndnow you can just use thosemultiplication rules for conferences toconstruct this so 3 to the 1 to 3 isequal to 3 to the 10 raised to the power12 that 's / 120 multiply it by another 3loss of 3 3 to the power 3 nowcontinually conferences or behind thereso that should be congruent to well 3 tothe 10 is congruent to 1 so that'scongruent to 1 to the 12 3 to the power3 will just multiply the 3 9 27 now 1 tothe 12 just 1 and 27 Elementor 27 is toodeep into 5 so that 's 5 mod 11 types ofthe question is the remainder equals 5and that 's one example of a type ofquestion well you can use Fermat'slittle theorem and also an example ofusing conferences now congresses arealso very handy in establishingdivisibility but this is already goingon long enough probably so I 'll makeanother video on divisibility provingsome of them using congresses test
