Hi and welcome to Math Antics . This video is all about dividing fractions , but in order to understand how dividing fractions works , we first need to learn about something called reciprocals.A reciprocal is just a fancy math term for what you get when you switch the top and bottom numbers of a fractions.For example , if you have the fraction 1 over 2 and then switch the top and bottom numbers , you¡¯ll end up with 2 over 1.2 over 1 is the reciprocal of 1 over 2.And , 1 over 2 is the reciprocal of 2 over 1.And an interesting thing about reciprocals is ; multiplying a fraction by its own reciprocal will always give you ¡®1¡¯.That¡¯s because you¡¯ll have the same multiplication problem on the top and bottom , so you¡¯ll end up with a whole fraction which is always ¡®1¡¯.Okay , that¡¯s nice , but what do reciprocals have to do with dividing fractions ? Well , reciprocals let us do a really cool trick that makes dividing fractions easy ! Whenever you have to divide something by a fraction , you can just multiply it by the reciprocal of that fraction instead , and you¡¯ll get the correct answer.And that¡¯s great news because multiplying fractions is so simple.This trick of multiplying by the reciprocal works because fractions are really just mini division problems , so when you multiply something by 1 over 2 , it¡¯s the same as dividing by 2 , since 2 is below the fraction¡¯s division line.AND¡­ dividing by 2 is the same as dividing by 2 over 1 , because you can turn any number into a fraction by just writing a ¡®1¡¯ as the bottom number , right ? But look¡­ reciprocals ! That¡¯s why multiplying by 1 over 2 is the same as dividing by 2 over 1.And it¡¯s true the other way around too.So really , it¡¯s kind of like you never have to divide fractions.You can just re-write your division problems so that you¡¯re multiplying by the reciprocal instead.Then when you multiply , you¡¯ll get the answer for the original division problem.As always , let¡¯s see a couple examples of how this works so you¡¯ll really understand.Let¡¯s try this problem : 3 over 4 , divided by 2 over 7.Okay , so the first thing we want to do is re-write our problem.Instead of dividing by 2 over 7 , we can multiply by the reciprocal instead.The reciprocal of 2 over 7 , is 7 over 2 , so our problem becomes 3 over 4 , times 7 over 2.Oh , I should mention a mistake that a lot of students make when they first learn to divide fractions.Sometimes students take the reciprocal of the first fraction ( the one that¡¯s being divided ) , or even the reciprocal of both fractions¡­ but you only want to take the reciprocal of the second fraction ( the one you are dividing BY ) .Okay , now that our problem has been changed to multiplication , it¡¯s easy ! Just multiply the tops ( 3 times 7 equals 21 ) and multiply the bottoms ( 4 times 2 equals 8 ) and we have the answer to our fraction division problem.So , 3 over 4 , divided by 2 over 7 , is 21 over 8.So that¡¯s pretty easy , but let¡¯s try one more example.Let¡¯s try 15 over 16 , divided by 9 over 22.Again , the first thing we want to do is re-write our problem.We¡¯ll change the ¡®divided by 9 over 22¡¯ into ¡®times 22 over 9¡¯.Now all we have to do is multiply , but since these numbers are kinda big , I¡¯m going to use my calculator to help . Let¡¯s see here¡­ so we have¡­ alright ! On the top we have , 15 times 22 equals 330 , and on the bottom , we have16 times 9 equals 144.So the answer to our division problem is 330 over 144.Of course that could be simplified for your final answer on a test , but we cover simplifying fractions in another video.Alright , that¡¯s how you divide fractions ; you just multiply by the reciprocal and you have your answer.But , there¡¯s one more thing I want to show you.You already know that the line between the top and bottom number of a fraction is just another form of the division symbol.Well , that means you 'll sometimes see fraction division problems written like this¡­This shows the top fraction ( 2 over 3 ) being divided by the bottom fraction ( 4 over 5 ) .It¡¯s really just that we have a fraction made up from other fractions.The top number is a fraction and the bottom number is a fraction.It just looks a little confusing because we have all these fractions lines here.But , we can make it look a lot better.Let¡¯s re-write this as a multiplication problem by taking the reciprocal of the bottom number ( the fraction that we are dividing BY ) and multiplying it by the fraction on top.There , that looks easier to do , and it¡¯s really the same problem ! We just need to multiply to get the answer.So 2 times 5 equals 10 , and 3 times 4 equals 12.Okay , so there you have it . What sounded really hard turns out to be as easy as flipping fractions upside-down.If you can multiply fractions , then you can divide fractions too ! Don¡¯t forget to practice what you¡¯ve learned by doing the exercises for this section.Thanks for watching and see ya next time.Learn more at www.mathantics.com Math Antics - Dividing Fractions Math Antics - Dividing Fractions Math Antics - Dividing Fractions
