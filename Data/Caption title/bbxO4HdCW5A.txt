two terms that get confused in geometryare the words circumscribed andinscribed but what 's the differencelet 's take a look at a couple examplesthis first example we have a trianglethat is inside of a circle well the waythat we could say this is either thepolygon is inscribed in the circle sothat 's the general way but since we havea triangle I could say the triangle isinscribed in the circlenotice that the triangle is within thetriangle so that 's how you could sayit 's inscribed the reverse of that is tosay the circle is circumscribed aboutthe polygon so if you 're wondering thisis formed by the point of concurrencycalled the circumcenter which is formedby the three perpendicular bisectorslet 's look at inscribed with aninscribed circle we have the circlethat 's within the polygon notice thathere we have a triangle in a circleinside of it and here we have aquadrilateral with a circle inside of itso if I look at this quadrilateralthere 's two ways that I could describethis picture the first is thequadrilateral is circumscribed about thecircle notice that when we use the wordcircumscribed we 're using about we couldalso say that this circle is inscribedinside the quadrilateral so twodifferent ways to describe the samepicture inscribed you should think it'swithin it 's inside and whenever you hearthe word circumscribe you should bethinking about or outside Circumscribed and Inscribed Circles and Polygons Circumscribed and Inscribed Circles and Polygons Circumscribed and Inscribed Circles and Polygons
