first thing going gon na draw graph dont care look like let try put vertices nicely graph gon na give vertex graph number choose randomly even negative number got negative two dont know want right three one minus one n know another two rule game goal make sure none vertices negative think one name game game imagine five people amount money debt move make game either donate money meaning vertex connected give dollar person take money meaning vertex connected take dollar goal game make sure everyone debt choosing give take give take everyone connected thats right right let take look example drawn see win game think well think three person give good k let let different color n get confused goes mean goes goes good negative instead negative better getting everyone debt three needs give cross written yeah got extra money n move want move could three consecutive move moving money yeah yeah right sok n want debt let three move time donate vertex toit connected guy two problem vertices left two minus try n consolidate oh let try want donate oh sorry went usually two oh way oh sorry see let said thing everyone goes minus one minus four right yeah person give good good yeah let get rid five give goes two one two minus two guess every time something move back right yeah go zero three yeah another good good zero minus one oh good right one one zero oh went went right much much difficulty got zero one zero one one demonstrate well obvious took optimal strategy win game possible could move one question could ask hand game like draw graph assign move win game even ask question might wonder possible win game right like star ted obviously impossible matter try going finish problem even think star ted property n add something like sum negative money board get everyone debt exactly obviously constraint win let slightly simpler version let say two vertices connect edge question kind money put game make possible example say work make winnable game answer well long win game thing need win enough money word got non negative sum bank board let something similar vertices obvious exactly still true right mean let say something negative maybe n know negative want enough money board got least let say donate money positive vertex vertices way theyre connected always balance two thing true two vertex example also true vertex example let try different arrangement three vertices turns possible arrangement enough money board never win game show way happen assign number minus let think going happen enough money board right sum donate one positive vertices immediately turn negative true matter many times try never get rid fact negative vertex graph even though enough money board always move yeah right much connection right difference two graph ca n move sort freely two chosen vertices donate nothing second case enough game winnable enough enough money board possible graph question tell turns really complicated actually answer question definitely advise sort mess around little bit draw kind graph want probably want connected make game little bit interesting assign respecting idea got enough money board right see thing end yeah really could mean depend patience level next time airport something often thats something play game want know yeah yeah full answer actually really complicated let tell partial answer tell game definitely winnable certain case special number assign graph call genus genus graph number edge graph minus number vertices graph plus one simple count genus case genus got one edge got two vertices add genus zero case got two vertices add one get zero case got three vertices plus one giving way detect notion little connected right complicated try move money around graph number genus give idea much complication turns show graph must winnable way win game amount money large genus graph surplus surplus knew game winnable exactly zero dollar board know game winnable said number dollar board genus zero right graph genus long zero dollar board win game yeah right could three would worked right bad game example n work zero dollar board reason genus one order win game got least one dollar board thing kind funny actually absolute characterization win game sometimes might less money think need still win game actually trying figure exactly nice characterization win game pretty complicated even even prove true much money genus graph win really advanced graph theory would really interested see n think given homework would really interested see much straightforward argument true much money guarantee winning set move win game genius first game much money oh good question let figure got one two three four got five vertices genus one also start star ted six minus three star ted board really sort rig ged game able better probably say could taken board still would able still weird go back look little difficult n yeah guarantee long draw solitaire graph property always way win even take long time think interesting thing winnable also incredibly interesting minimal number move yeah winnable complicated prove n think proof complete characterization optimal strategy game like puzzle like one seen n check today show
