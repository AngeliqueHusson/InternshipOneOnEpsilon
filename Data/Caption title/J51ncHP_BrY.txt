Hey , Vsauce ! Michael here ! If you core a sphere ; that is , remove a cylinder from it , you 'll be left with a shapecalled a Napkin ring because , well , it looks like a napkin ring ! It 's a bizarre shape because if two Napkin rings have the same height , wellthey 'll have the same volume regardless of the size of the spheres they came from ! ( Cool ) This means that if you cut equally tall napkin rings from an orange and from the Earth , well , one could be held in your hand . The other would have the circumference of our entire planet , but both would have the same volume ... I mentioned this counterintuitive fact while making a Kendama with Adam Savage . Check that video out if you have n't , or better yet , just come see us . We 're bringing brain candy live to 24 new cities this fall . It 's going to be busy , but right nowWe 're talking about balls and coring them ! I have here TWO napkin rings from very differently sized spheres ; one is from a tiny ball , just a little tomato that I 've cored , so it 's got a little hole in it right there.The other Napkin ring is made from an orange , but both Napkin rings have the same height . The tomato has a smallercircumference than the orange which means less volume , but its ring is thicker which means more volume . Both of those effectsexactly cancel out . So these two napkin rings have identical volumes they take up the same amount of spaceBy the way orange oil is flammableTo see why the napkin ring problem is true , let 's discuss Cavalieri 's principle . It states that for any two solids like these two cylinders I 've built heresandwiched between parallel planes if any other parallel planeIntersects both in regions of equal area no matter where it 's taken fromWell then the solids have the same volume . That 's clearly true here these cylinders are built out of stacks of VSauce stickers100 in each Stack so their volumes are the sameif ISkew one of them like this it shape will change , but it 's volume has n't it 's still contained the same amount of stuffI have n't added or subtracted stickersAnd Cavalieri 's principle ensures that they still have the same volume because any cross-section taken from down here up here in the middle anywhereWill always give us a region of the same area as the other because those regions are always equal area circles.Now let 's Apply Cavalieri 's principle to Napkin RingsWe can see that two napkin Rings with similar Heights haveidentical volumes by showing that when cut by a plane the area of one 's cross sectionAlways equals the area of the others now to do thisNotice that the area of the spheres cross section minus the area of the cylinders cross section gives us the area of the Napkin ringsCross section . Depending on where we slice the Napkin ring the cross sections will have different areasBut they will always be the same as each other . Let 's calculate the areas of these blue ringsfirst of all let 's call the height of the Napkin ring h and the radius of the sphere they 're cut fromcapital RAlright , perfect now a cross section of a sphere like this and a cross section of a cylinder like this are both circlesSo their areas can be determined by using Pi times the radius squaredSo if we want to find the area of the spheres cross section and subtract the area of the cylinders cross section ( I 'll draw a picture of a cylinder here ) , all we need to do is take Pimultiply it by the radius of the sphere cross sectionSquare that and then subtract Pi times the radius of the cylinder Squared , but what are their Radii ? Well , if this is the center of the sphere we can draw a line straight up to the corner of the cylinder down the sideof the cylinder and then connect to form a right triangleThe Pythagorean Theorem will really help us here it tells us that the length of one side squared plus the length of the other sidesquared equals the length of the hypotenuse squaredNow this distance right here this side of the triangle what we wantIt 's the radius of the cylinder , so we 'll call this the little r radius of the cylinder ( beautiful little picture there ) so the radius ofthe cylindersquared plusthis side length , which is just half the height of the cylinder , so the height of the cylinder divided by 2squaredEquals the hypotenuse squared the hypotenuse happens to be the radius of the sphere itself which is capital RPerfect now let 's solve for the radius of the cylinder . Which is what we wantWe 'll just subtract h over 2 squared from both sides that 'll give us the radius of the cylindersquaredequaling the radius of the sphere squared minusHalf the height of the cylinder squaredWe can take the square root of both sides so that we wind up with the radius of the cylinderequaling the square root of the radius of the sphereminus 1/2 the height of the cylinder squaredPerfect ok now let 's take a look at the area of a cross-section of the sphere now for thislet 's draw a straight line from the center out to the edge ofthe sphere'sCross-section , and we 'll go straight down and connect back up , hey look ! Another right trianglelet 's call this height yAnd notice that this distance now the side of the triangle down here is actually the radius of the circleCross-section up here . They 're both equal so we even want to solve for this the radius of the circle that is the spheres cross-sectionOkayso we know that the radius ofThe sphere 's Cross-Section squared plus this distance squared ( which is y ) Equals the hypotenuse squared well , what do you know the hypotenuse is the radius of the sphere again ( capital R ) Ok let 's subtract y squared from both sides the radius of the spheres cross-section squaredequals the radius of the sphere squared minusY squared will take the square root of both sides and end uplearning that the radius of the sphere 's cross-section equals the square root ofThe radius of the sphere squared minus y squared . Y is the height that thisCross-section is taken from above the equator the higher up we take these cross sections of the sphere the smaller their radii will beWhereas the cylinders radius is always the same no matter where we cut fromAnyway , let 's take these two Radii and plug them into our formulaOkay , the area of the cross section of the sphere is what we want firstOkay , that 's just the square root of R squared minus y squaredNot too bad now the radius of the cylinder is the square root of R squared minusHalf the height of the cylinder squared now what you might notice is that we 're taking the square root of something and then squaring itThese actually cancel each other outperfect ! Much more simple lookingBut now let 's distribute Pi to the terms inside the parentheses so pi times R squared gives us Pi RSquared Pi times negative y squared gives us negative pi y squaredThen a negative Pi times Rsquared is negative pi R squared negative Pi times negative h over 2 squared is positive Pih over 2Squared . Great , now we can keep simplifying but what you might notice is that we have a pi r squared and aminus Pi R squared , well , that equals 0 so theseCompletely cancel each other out , but what we 're left with areTerms containing no mention of the spheres Radius whether the radius is large or smallDoes n't matter all you need to know to find the area of the cross section of a napkin ringis the height of the Napkin RingY , of course , is bounded by the height of a napkin ring these blue areas have the same area as each other and this willBe true no matter where we cut the cross section across the napkin ring meaning by Cavalieri 's principle that both Napkin Rings have the sameVolumeYay :3 ( with teeth ) But what is this mean for you for life in the universe ? Well as we know if you like it you should put a ring on itbut if you like It , do n't know it 's finger width and only want to offer it a predetermined amount of materialyou should put a napkin ring on it.And as alwaysThanks for watching : DOn August 21st2017 there will be a total solar eclipse the shadow of the Moon will race across the Contiguous United StatesIt 's going to be incredible and a little bit scaryI 'm sure I will be viewing it from Oregon with my friends at Atlas , Obscura . I ca n't wait , but keep your eyesSafe if you want to view the eclipse you have to have special eye protectionthe curiosity Box comes with such glasses these block99.999 % of visible light that 's what it takes to be able to look right at the sun as actually what I love about these glassesThere 's no eclipse going on . You can still just look at the sunNotice that it 's a ball . Maybe imagine what kind of Napkin ringYou 'd like to make it into . The currentCuriosity box is my favorite . The one that you 'll get if you subscribe right now comes with all kinds of cool stuff that comes withA poster showing that all the planets and pluto can fit between the earth and the moon it also comes with science gadgets like theselevitating magnetic ringspretty cool also a portion of all proceeds go to alzheimer 's research , so it 's good for your brain andEveryone else 's brain check it out . I hope to see you at Brain Candy live and as alwaysThanks for watching The Napkin Ring Problem The Napkin Ring Problem The Napkin Ring Problem
