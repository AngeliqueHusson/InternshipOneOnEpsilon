- [ Voiceover ] So we have a bunch of numbers listed up here , and my goal , in this video , is to see if we can classifythem into different types of number categories , and let me draw the categories.So this circle , over here , this represents all of the numbersthat can be represented as the fractionof two integers , and , of course , the denominatorca n't be equal to zero , because we do n't knowwhat it means to put a zero in the denominator.So , let 's call these , or the standard wayof calling these things.These things can be represented as a fractionof two integers , we call these rational numbers.Rational numbers.And if something can not be represented as a fractionof two integers , we call irrational numbers.Irrational numbers.Irrational numbers.And the size of these circles do n't showhow large these sets are.There 's actually an infinite number of rationaland an infinite number of irrational numbers.So , these are the irrational numbers.Irrational.So , these can not be represented as a fractionof two integers.And then , within rational numbers , you have integers themselves.So , I 'll do that in , let me do that in this blue color.Integers.So , integers are numbers that do n't haveto be represented as a fraction or a decimal.So , these are integers , right over here.Integers.And then a subset of integers are whole numbers.So , if you essentially say the non-negative integers , you 're then talking about whole numbers.So let me do that subset , right over here.So , these are going to be the whole numbers.So , whole numbers.Whole numbers , right over here.And , actually , let me just label it all.These are rational ... Let me do that in the same color.Rational numbers.And , of course , irrational numbers.Irrational numbers.Irrational numbers.An integer.Well , if I could say , '' Look , that is an integer . `` Let 's think about the integers . `` But I would n't say , `` Let's just think about the rational . `` I 'd say , `` Let 's think about the rational numbers . `` All right , now that we have these categories in place , let 's categorize them.Like always , pause the video.See if you can figure out what categorythese numbers fall into.Where would you put them on this diagram ? So , let 's start off with three.This is positive three.It can be definitely represented as a fraction.You can represent it as three over one.But , it does n't have to be represented as a fraction.It , literally , could be just a three , right over there , but it 's also non-negative.So three is a whole number.So three , and maybe I 'll do it in the color of the category.So , three is a whole number.So , it 's a member of that set.But if you 're a whole number , you 're also an integer , and you 're also a rational number.So , three is a whole number , it 's an integer , and it 's a rational number.Now , let 's think about negative five.Now , negative five , once again , it can be representedas a fraction , but it does n't have to be , but it is negative.So , it 's not gon na be a whole number.So , negative five is going to sit right over here.It 's an integer , and if you 're an integer , you 're definitely going to be a rational number , but it 's not a whole number because it is negative.Now we have 0.25.Well , this , for sure , can be represented as a fraction.This is 25-hundredths , right over here.So , we can represent that as a fractionof two integers , I should say.It 's 25-hundredths.But there 's no way to represent thisexcept using a fraction of two integers.So , 0.25 is a rational number , but it 's not an integer and not a whole number.Now what about 22 over seven.Well , here it 's clearly represented , already , as a fraction of two integers , but I do n't think I can represent this any other , except as a fraction of two integers.I ca n't somehow make thiswithout using a fraction or some type of decimalthat might repeat.So , this , right over here , this wouldalso be a rational number , but it 's not an integer , not a whole number.Now this over here.0.2713.Now the 13 repeats.This is the same thing as 0.27131313 , that 's what line up there represents.Now , you might not realize it yet , but any number that repeats eventually , this one does repeat eventually , you have the .1313 , or you have the 0.27131313 , any number like this can be represented as a fraction.For example , and I'm not going to do it here , just for the sake of time , but , for example , 0.3 , repeating , that 's the same thing as one-third.And later on , we 're gon na see techniquesof how do you convert this to a fraction of two integers.But , for our sake , we just knowthat this can be represented as a fraction of two integersjust the way that 0.3 , repeating , can be.And so , we would put this under rational numbers.0.2713 , repeating.But you have to represent it either as a decimalor a fraction of integers.If you did n't have to , then it could have been an integer , but we 'll throw it up there in rational numbers.Now the square root of ten.Square root of ten.This is interesting.So , any square root of a non-perfect squareis going to be irrational.So , this is gon na be irrational.I 'm not proving it to you here , but you can not represent this as the ratioof two integers , or a fraction with two integers , with an integer in the numeratorand an integer in the denominator.This will be , if you were to represent itas a decimal , it will not repeat.It 'll just keep being new and new digits.It will not repeat over time.So , this , right over here , is an irrational number.It 's not rational.It can not be represented as the ratio of two integers.All right , 14 over seven.This is the ratio of two integers.So , this , for sure , is rational.But if you think about it , 14 over seven , that 's another way of saying,14 over seven is the same thing as two.These two things are equivalent.So , 14 over seven is the same thing as two.So , this is actually a whole number.It does n't look like a whole number , but , remember , a whole numberis a non-negative number that does n't needto be represented as the ratio of two integers.And this one , even though we did represent itas the ratio of two integers , it does n't needto be represented as the ratio of two integers.You could have represent this as just two.So , that 's going to be a whole number.14 over seven , which is the same thing as two , that is a whole number.Now , two-pi.Now pi is an irrational ... Pi is an irrational number.So if we just take a multiple of pi , if we just take a integer multiple of pi , like that , this is also going to be an irrational number.If you looked at its decimal representation , it will never repeat.So that 's two-pi , right over there.Now what about ... Let me do that same , since I 've been consistent , relatively consistent , with the colors.So , this is two-pi right over there.Now , what about the negative square root of 25.Well , 25 's a perfect square.Square root of that 's just gon na be five.So , this thing is going to be , this thing is going to be equivalent to negative five.So , this is just another representationof this , right over here.So , it is an integer.It 's not a whole number because it 's negative , but it 's an integer.Negative square root of 25.These two things are actually ... These two things are actually the same number , just different ways of representing them.And then you have , let's see , you have the square rootof nine over ... The square root of nine over seven.Well , what 's the principal root of nine ? This thing is gon na be the same thing , this thing is the same ... Let me do this in a different color.This is the same thing as , square root of nine is three , it 's the principal root of nine , so it 's three-sevenths.So , this is a ratio of two integers.This is a rational number.Square root of nine over sevenis the same thing as three-sevenths.Now , let me just give you one more just for the road.What about pi over pi ? What is that going to be ? Well , pi divided by pi is going to be equal to one.So , this is actually a whole number.So I could write pi over pi , right over there.That 's just a very fancy way of saying one . test
