so welcome to my video on changing animproper fraction into a mixed number sohere we have the improper fraction 9over 4 it 's improper because we have anumerator of 9 which is bigger than ourdenominator and we want to change itinto a mixed number and this is donethrough long division so what I 'm goingto do is since 9 is being divided by 4I 'm going to use long division anddivide 9 by 4 so now I have to see howmany times 4 goes into 9 we know 4 goesinto 9 at least 2 times and if youmultiply 2 times 4 2 times 4 is 8 and ifwe subtract 9 minus 8 we get a remainderof 1 so since 4 goes into 9 2 times ourmixed number is going to have a wholenumber of two and since we have a 1 leftover and our remainder our mixed numberis going to have a 1 in the numeratorand our denominator always stays thesame since we have a 4 denominator inour fraction or could also have a 4denominator in our mixed number so 9over 4 is equal to 2 and 1/4 and I wantto show you an illustration so thismakes a little bit more sense since wehave a whole number of two I 'm going todraw two whole pies and since we'redealing with fourths and we have 1/4 inour denominator we 're going to dividethese pies into fourths and since wealso have a fraction of 1/4 I 'm going todraw an extra 1/4 piece of the pie solet 's count how many 4 for the pies wehave total we have 1/4 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9we have nine fourths of the pie or 9over 4so hopefully you can see that nine forceof the pie is exactly equal to two wholepies plus 1/4 so hopefully this makesmore sense how an improper fraction of 9over 4 is exactly equal to a mixednumber of 2 and 1/4 so here are somemore videos with some more exampleproblems related to the video you justwatchedI really hope you 're finding mytutorials helpful so until my next videoI will see you later test
