welcome say about to explore very basicquestion y is negative x positiveactually negative answer and it seemslike a very basic question is actuallysomething very subtle growing on that'sworth pointing out and most people don'tthink of this to get us going let'slet 's talk about multiplication ingeneral a very elementary level forexample at the very beginning what do wethink of when I say 3 times 4 or usuallythink of this as repeated addition so atleast at the level of counting numbersbut multiplication is regarded as repeataddition so three groups of four threegroups of four so when I do this I haveone group of four here they all drivefour dots plus another group of fourplus another group of four dot 12 dotsmaking total so three groups of four isreally 14 plus another 4 plus another 4and when I say five times 2012 I'mreally thinking of five groups of 12 12plus 12 plus 12 plus 12 plus 12 and ibelieve that 60 all right so at the verybasics the very beginning we like to saythat three times four is three isrepeated addition all right what I'dlike to do now is just take this ideaand be a little more systematic about itbecause there 's something deep going onhere here 's one key before another groupbefore the third group before let me dothese dots in a nice systematic mannerlet me put one group of four in a rowput a second my second group before in asecond row of dots and my third group offour and a third row of dots if I lookthis way I am indeed seeing three groupsof four do I take this very same pictureand a steady look this way I actuallysee a completely differentmultiplication problem I see fourcolumns of three four groups of threewas the same picture the answer must bethe same so 4 times 3 has to bephilosophically now the same arts as 3times for those not at all obvious wethink about it why is a groups of beguaranteed to be the same as B groups ofa it 's only when I draw a picture likean array in a rectangle that this isfeels true feels right but that leads meto the big question does this rule thiscommutative property which is seems tobe Evan tlie true at least for positivecountingfeels so right and so natural that wouldlike to say it 's true for all types ofnumbers and that 's a light question Iuse the word what we 'd like to say it'strue it 's a choice so most people saywell yes I 'd like to believe that thisworks for all types of numbers not forcounting numbers in which case there aresome logical consequence we have to livewith and no matter what you think aboutthese consequences they 're going to bethere see it goes let me explore whatdoes this community law say aboutdealing with negative numbers now allright if I let me just clean screen hereso I 'm a little jumbled drip drip dripto door that 's a little more smudgythere get rid of that smudge all rightsuppose I asked for now three groups ofnegative 4 I can handle that I'mthinking of multiplication as repeatedaddition so that 's one group of negative4 plus another group of negative 4 plus11 another group negative 4 i 'm notquite sure what I 'm drawinggeometrically anti dots or somethingmany case- or purse name before sayingbefore this negative 12 so I 'm willingto believe that positive times negativeis negative it seems natural so whatabout negative x positive negative 3times 4 now back to my elementary modelof multiplication being repeatedaddition this is out the window now Iknow what to make of this negative threegroups of four that 's not the same asnegative 4 and negative 4 negative 4that 's a different question negativethree groups of four very strange thisis very confusing I put lots of questionmarks around that becausephilosophically it 's bizarre butremember we 're playing a game we'replaying game where we 'd like to believethat a times B equals B times a for alltypes of numbers I ca n't draw a picturefor it 's just a belief now and we'regoing to go with this belief that I haveto say to myself okay nig three timesfor do n't know what it means but itwould be the same as for groups ofnegative three that I can handle that'sone group of negative 3 plus anothergroup of negative 3 plus another groupof negative 3 plus another groupnegative 3 and that 's negative 12 thereit is negative x positive I choose toplay this game is going to have to benegative of course if I take a littlefurther an explorer negative x negativewell why is that positthat 's worthy of another video thanks Why is Negative times Positive Negative?
