what is the golden ratio it 's the ratioof sides of a special rectangle a goldenrectangle if you cut off a square theleftover rectangle has the sameproportions as the original rectanglethat is a plus B over a equals a over Bthis ratio is often represented with theGreek letter P it has been claimed thatgolden rectangles appear in ancientGreek architecture and some famousartwork but this is not borne out bymeasurements the Greeks interest in thisquantity probably started when theyconsidered the regular pentagon if theside length is 1 then the length of adiagonal is the golden ratio closelyrelated is the pentagram if the shortestof these lengths equals 1 then the otherlengths are powers of P over 500 yearsago the Renaissance thinker Luca Pacioliwas also bewitched by this ratio so hewrote the book the divine proportionillustrated by his friend Leonardo daVinci the book studies various geometricsolids and the golden ratios appearancein architecture and the human body someartists have explicitly embraced thisratio such as salvador dali where thecanvas for his painting the sacrament ofthe Last Supper is a golden rectangleand the windows in the background areframed by a dodecahedron a regular solidwith 12 pentagonal faces that alsoconnects to the golden ratio I don'twant to argue for or against the goldenratio in nature and art but rather showthe many cool ways where the goldenratio appears in mathematics first whatis the value of the golden ratioremember that it is defined as thequotient a over B by rewriting theequation and doing a bit of algebra onefinds that V satisfies this quadraticequation we use this to solve for feeand then find a similar expression forone over fee the appearance of thesquare root of five should not besurprising because of these relationsthe Pentagon in fact this connectionexplains why fee can be written in termsoffunctions people today often firstencounter fee with its connection to thefamous Fibonacci numbers by taking theratio of consecutive Fibonacci numbersthe limit of these ratios approaches feebut this is n't unique to the Fibonaccinumbers the lucas numbers named after edwilde Luka are also built by adding twoterms to get the next term the ratio ofconsecutive lucas numbers alsoapproaches the golden ratio but the plotthickensboth the Fibonacci numbers and the Lucasnumbers can be written in terms ofpowers of fee these are called DNAformulas these formulas imply thatpowers of fee with or without dividingby the square root of five areincreasingly close to integers as abonus here are two formulas that connectpowers of the golden ratio to theFibonacci numbers okay let 's get back togeometry a golden rectangle can beprogressively dissected into squareswhose side lengths depend on fee somepeople also like to draw the GoldenSpiral but how can we construct feegeometrically start with 4 1 by 1squares connect these two corners thenconstruct this circle the length of thered segment is fee can you see why thisis true there are other ways to get feedgeometrically here 's a way with twosquares in a circle here 's a way withthree squares in a circle here 's anotherway with three squares and a circle orhere 's a way to get fee with two regularPentagon 's or switch to these two sidesthe golden ratio is also used to makekites and darts which fit togetherperfectly to form Penrose tilings of theplane moving to three dimensions threeorthogonal golden rectangles can beconstructed with the twelve vertices ofa regular icosahedronlet 's connect feedback to numberssuppose we look at these nestedfractions with one 's working them outshows that we have ratios of consecutiveFibonacci numbers if these fractionscontinued foreverwe have that the limit is the goldenratio a way to see this without theBonacci numbers is to label thecontinued fraction as X notice that thecontinued fraction in the red box isalso X leaving us with this simpleexpression we can now solve thisequation and show that x equals feeinstead of nesting fractions suppose wenest square roots borrowing the sametrick let X be the expression withinfinitely many square roots andrecognize that the red box captures theoriginal expression so X satisfies thisformula which in turn produces feehere 's a different connection to numberswe say that the floor of a number iswhat you get when you round down so forexample the floor of nine point eight isnine and the floor of pi is three nowlet 's look at the floor of each multipleof be calculating the first few valuesproduces the sequence one three four etcbut what about the numbers we skippedtwo five seven etc it ends up that theseare obtained a similar way with thefloor function and multiples of thenumber B over B minus one this is aspecial instance of BT 's theorem okayone last beautiful formula this eyecatcher connects an infinite series thatinvolves the golden ratio to an infinitecontinued fraction involving theFibonacci numbers it 's so nice that
