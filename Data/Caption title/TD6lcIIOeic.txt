there are only ten kinds of people inthis world those who understand binaryand those who don'they it 's really more of a visual jokebecause it 's not ten it 's one Oh welcometo math bytes today we 'll talk aboutbinary numbers also known as base twobut what is base - this is I stole itI know what base 2 is second baseyeah no no not these two is some sort ofa math language yes okay daddy smartbase 2 is an alternate way of expressingnumbers which has many applicationsincluding for the device upon which youare currently watching this video speaksat it 's very core language in binarycode ones and zeros baby it 's true theimage you see is not really me rather abase 2 representation of this so-calledbut before we can understand binarynumbers we should take a closer look atour own decimal number system the goodol familiar phase 10 in base 10 we have10 symbols at our disposal forrepresenting numbers as you know invarious combinations the symbols canrepresent any number of objects we canthink of using something called placevalue which gives us a lot more bang forthe buck for a mere 10 little symbols ifyou know what I mean each column ofnumbers represents multiplication timesthe power of 10 there 's the ones place10 to the 0 power tens place 10 to the 1power hundreds place 10 to the 2 powerand so onso when you see number like 375 in base10 you 're really seeing this most of theworld uses these symbols along withpowers of 10 and has for a long longtime it 's a great system I do n't get itwhy you use 10 what makes 10 so specialthat 's how many fingers we have oh Ido n't get itdo you know what they 're talking aboutnot a clue nope most of us have 10fingers anyway the point of all that wasto give you a context for how binaryworks in binaryinstead of using ten symbols and powersof 10 we use just two symbols and powersof two and we can still express bignumbers using just two symbols base twoor binary works the same way as thedecimal system but this time each columnof numbers represents multiplicationtimes a power of two there 's the onesplace 2 to the 0 power 2 is placed 2 tothe 1 power 4 is placed 2 to the 2 powerand so onof course it 's a little harder toexpress big numbers this way you need alot more digits so if it 's thatinefficient why do compares use it wellit 's how they store and relayinformation butthe core of computers is justelectronics after all and for any givenpathway on a circuit board you gottaadmit either a current is flowing orit 's not yes no on/off yeah no yes yesno on/off one zero binarynow I know what you 're thinking but howdo we do math with binary numbersboolean logic and boolean logic is usedto design the components in computerprocessors so surf away you 've gotboolean logic - thank you have reachedyour destination thank you boo leanthank you boolean logic Thank Youboolean logic it 's David thank youyou ca n't write line if the circuitdesign is n't efficientand the computer works when a refinerycompanyturn fool the takeaway did the takeawaytable just a little tidbit of mathygoodness to make you look smartercocktail partiesyes calculate the square root ofbrilliance doubling hahatoday 's tip binary numbers are thelanguage of all electronics a bunch ofones and zeroes oh and by the way nowyou totally understand this joke rightbecause what 's one oh and binary two sothere 's two types of people get it justnod and smile thanks for joining ustoday on math bytes hope you have a newperspective on binary and perhaps adeeper appreciation for our own fabulousbase-10 Decimal System see you next timethanks for watching the binary episodeof math bytes but I know what you reallywant to do is watch a two-year-oldrecite the quadratic formula rightthat 's my sonhashtag brag or see how shiny parks andrecreations Jim O'Hara 's teeth reallyare I mean right so click here for themath heads episode and click here tosubscribe to Nerdist and if you want tolearn math for my books click here yeahII so many clicks test
