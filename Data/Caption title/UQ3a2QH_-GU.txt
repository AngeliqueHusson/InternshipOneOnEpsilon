video want talk integer floor function like think floor function remind little bit somehow confuse integer floor function say basically say whatever number put round nearest integer mean well always graph let also plot point first one going look going equal floor x start plotting point x plug say zero point five look first whole number less equal number well look equivalently like said round nearest whole number get zero likewise plug zero point six round nearest whole number get zero plug zero get zero likewise know goup nine nine round first whole number zero likewise plug say even zero round nearest whole number less equal number also get zero want graph basically kind chopping decimal part another way think say graph extend way get one think idea go graph plug one first whole number less equal mean graph going jump continue process first hole number less equal know stuff random kind chop decimal part left point still give chop decimal part aflat line get going happen get know think first whole number less equal first whole number less equal going extend manner go little circle jump start go keep keep little stair step pattern let think maybe plug plug couple negative suppose plug negative well first hole number less equal would actually negative thing plug negative would get negative plug negative get negative plug negative first hole number less equal negative said basically getting little portion graph matter number plug negative give negative likewise could pick maybe couple think hopefully kind see pattern point negative number less equal would negative negative dot hereat negative likewise negative negative floor function little sometimes step function well little stair step basic idea function sometimes put kind braces sometimes well write like top arms n mean exact thing understand kind basic part function graph two would relatively easy also know graph transformation got definitely couple graph may want take look refresher let erase step function longer need may want know may want cop may want backtrack video write copy integer function know kind compare time remember replace inside x minus going happen graph case may want video horizontal vertical shift replace x x minus actually shift original graph going shift original graph integer function right three instead starting zero extending one going three move one two three go little step pattern start would correspond x backtrack way well kind everyone unit every one unit pattern would would continue kind plot point check make sure mean graph ing step function suppose plug x three point five well plug bar going get three point five minus three say inside going get floor three point five minus three thats floor think first number less equal zero say plug three point five get zero thats get basic graph really easiest thing think think term last least let graph floor function minus two seen know minus two move original graph complete let put couple instead starting zero zero like extending move two start negative two extend likewise one one level circle two three four five jump move jump move jump move pattern also continue left side like basically exact graph get little bit left righto kay hope couple make little bit sense integer function honestly function dont see much give little bit issue hopefully soon probably wo n mess terribly much right question feel free send try get toit getting call sand n hold breath right good luck graph ing integer floor function graph ing integer floor function graph ing integer floor function graph ing integer floor function graph ing integer floor function graph ing integer floor function graph ing integer floor function graph ing integer floor function graph ing integer floor function graph ing integer floor function graph ing integer floor function graph ing integer floor function graph ing integer floor function graph ing integer floor function graph ing integer floor function
