ROB EASTAWAY : `` Jurassic Park , '' we 've all seen the film , butvery few people have read the book , including me.I 've not actually read the book , but I have looked at thepictures because there's something in there that isjust kind of really weird , a little pattern , a beautifulpattern that 's very little known.So I just wanted to share it with you.So we 're going to get to it just by -- I 've just got a random piece of paper here.It happens to be brown.We 're just going to fold this bit of paper in half.So I fold it like this , crease it , and you 've kind of got aseagull there.And if it forms a V , of course.I mean , nothing surprising so far.I 'm going to be consistent here.So I 'm folding that which is your left over right , and I'mgoing to do it again.So fold it again , left over right , and crease it.And if I sort of pull it apart now , OK , so we 've got , readingleft to right , can you see there 's a sort of peak , thenthere 's a valley , then there 's a valley.So we 'll call this peak , valley , valley , OK ? Or and remember this for later , if I sort of close itup a bit , it 's a sauce spoon , OK ? So I fold it over once , and I fold it twice , and I fold over again.Now , can you predict what the pattern is going to be ofvalleys and peaks ? Now , you 'd probably think that something as repetitive asthis is going to be some really obvious pattern , andit 's either going to alternate , maybe valley-peak , valley-peak.Or you might think -- I to know -- it 's going to create a little -- obvious little zigzaggy kind of pattern.But that 's not the case.If I pull it out , it goes peak-peak ; valley-valley ; peak ; valley-valley.So what 's the pattern here ? And indeed , can you predict what 's going to happen when Ifold it for a fourth time ? So we do one , and two , and three , and fold it a fourthtime , and unfurl it.Well , it 's kind of good to try and predict before you see it , but here we go.And now we 've got peak-peak ; valley ; peak-peak ; valley-valley-valley ; peak-peak ; valley-valley ; peak ; valley-valley.It 's kind of -- if not random , it 's certainly not a reallyobvious and easy pattern.And if just start closing this up , and you turn these intoright angles , you can see that what 's emerging is something -- well , something that 's clearly not trivial , but it'scertainly not clear what 's going on.And this is where we turn to the book , OK ? Could you get yourself your nice cheap copy or brand newcopy of `` Jurassic Park , '' and you turn topage whatever it is.And you have this page which says `` first iteration , '' andyou 've got this pattern.So this is actually what you get when you fold our strip ofpaper four times.So if you call a fold an iteration , really you shouldbe calling this the fourth iteration.I do n't know why it's the first iterationin here , but anyway.The second question , of course , is what is it doing in '' Jurassic Park ? '' And there 's a little cryptic reference atthe bottom of the page by Ian Malcolm who 's themathematician who features in this story . `` At the earliest drawings of the fractal curve , few cluesto the underlying mathematical structure will be seen . `` So he talked about a fractal.So this is going to turn into a fractal of some kind.Can you picture what that fractal will be ? I certainly ca n't , not without having seen it first.If we keep folding our paper , which we 're not going to dobecause there 's a limit to how many times even with a longstrip of paper you can fold it.Another fold , what 's called a second iteration here , produces this pattern , which is -- I guess that what 's kind of interesting is , withoutcrossing over itself , it joins and forms this little block , this little rectangle and another square there.I think the reason why there are fractals appearing in hereis that there 's a sort of theme about theunpredictability of systems and chaos , and the fact thatwe 've set up Jurassic Park , and all these creatures aregoing to behave in a certain way.And here 's this doom-monger saying it could all gohorribly wrong because what we think is predictable couldturn out to be chaotic and so on.So that 's the metaphor , I think , that 's being used.So if I keep folding the paper , Iget the third iteration.It 's getting a bit more involved , but it 's still hardto see any pattern emerging from this.And we go quite a lot of pages further before we get towhat 's called the fourth iteration.Actually , there 's been a few more folds here , so thenumbers at the top are kind of going out the window.But now we 've got this big block just from folding thepaper right over left , and we zip aheadto the fifth iteration.Well , now you 've got these kind of blocks appearing , andthey 're a bit like lizards.I do n't think that 's a deliberate reference toJurassic Park or anything , but there 's some things which arealmost animal-like about this thing.And you keep going to what's called the sixth iteration.There are lots -- way more than you can fold a bit of paper.You get this rather stunning pattern emerging.And in fact , what you 'll find is that each of these , themain shape in the center , has been then rotated and rotated.And typically , they 're being rotated by 45 degrees , and thedimensions are being reduced by the squareroot of 2 each time.Why folding a piece of paper could lead to something asstunning as this is just -- you know , it 's mind blowing.We 've all seen fractals.There 's lots of fractals that are famous.This one , which is so easy to produce , is actuallyremarkably little known despite featuring in `` JurassicPark . `` And we go all the way to the end , an infinite number offolds of paper.We get what 's called here the seventh iteration , thisbeautiful solid block.And even more stunning is the fact you can picture stickinganother of these curves in.They would sort of fit together like jigsaw pieces.You can see another dragon curve outlined here.So if you imagine you 've got a black one and a blue one and ayellow one , you could actually stick them together to make areally cool kitchen floor tiling.It would be a bit hard to do.But to produce something like this , I do n't think anyonewould predict that.BRADY HARAN : That's pretty cool.ROB EASTAWAY : Mm.I love it.And I love the fact that the whole world knows aboutfractals , but whenever I show a group of people the dragoncurve , they say I 've never seen this before.And who would have thought that you couldget to it so simply . [ DINOSAUR ROARS ] ROB EASTAWAY : I think he likes it.BRADY HARAN : If there are many sides , then the angles becometoo shallow so that the next one would onlyhave a little bit.I 'm going to put in another polygon out here and matchthat one there.I 'd end up with only a little sliver under there . test
