two approach es long division weve got jam es go left right explosion end got standard algorithm usually taught school course correct good right thing fine let compare sure actually thing right first go left right three plus two five example plus example h getting right correct ill example maybe explode leaving behind extra dot make maybe explode leaving side behind extra dot grant theres tangent method deal end said whats whats standard algorithm well standard algorithm took problem time work right left go want fact allow two algorithm say dont explosion right ten sort explosion behind thigh explosion make extra dot extra extra one top really explosion go plus plus dont write write explosion need left behind extra explode make extra dot algorithm x write get style thing standard album kind cool goes right explosion prefer go left right explosion end matter style approach es correct virtually good sparrow taste one like better stuff aside traditional addition algorithm aside traditional addition algorithm aside traditional addition algorithm aside traditional addition algorithm aside traditional addition algorithm aside traditional addition algorithm aside traditional addition algorithm aside traditional addition algorithm aside traditional addition algorithm
