okay we have two approaches for doinglong division we 've got the James patentway we just go left to right and do allthe explosions at the end and we got thestandard algorithm ones usually taughtin school of course both the correctboth are doing good right things andfine to do but let 's compare them let'smake sure they are actually doing thesame thing all right first of all my waylet 's go left to right three plus two isfive in this example 5 plus 8 13 8 foursevens 15 so in my example of 350 h plus287 I 'm getting 513 215 all right how doI correct it up but I 'll do someexplosions example maybe 10 from the 13will explode leaving what 3 behind extradot there makes 603 T 15 maybe 10 fromhere will explode what leaving sidebehind extra dot here for 645 grantthere 's the tangent method withexplosions just do it and then deal withexplosions at the end I said what 's thiswhat 's the standard algorithm here wellthe standard algorithm took the sameproblem but this time work right to leftyou go 8 / 7 is 15 now I want to write50 in fact I can you allow two but theiralgorithm says no no do n't do thatactually do an explosion right now thatis ten of these sorts of explosion whatjust 5 behind so you 're only botheredwriting down the thighs and 10 explosionwill make an extra dot here whicharrived as an extra 10 and extra one atthe top so that really was an explosionthen you go 1 plus 5 plus 8 is 14 youdo n't write 14 you 'll just write a 4because you do an explosion no need forbe left behind but extra 10 will explodeto make an extra dot there which thealgorithm X you write as a 1 now get 600645 so as a style thing the standardalbum is kind of cool it goes right toleft and has you do explosions as you goalong I prefer to go left to right andyour explosion at the end just a matterof style both approaches are correct forthe virtually good now Sparrow tastewhich one you like better up to you okaygood stuff Aside: The Traditional Addition Algorithm Aside: The Traditional Addition Algorithm Aside: The Traditional Addition Algorithm
