hi rob welcome math antic sin video going learn big math word really big concept algebra pay attention understand polynomial need learn mathematician call term algebra term mathematical expression made two different part sa number part variable term number part variable part together since multiplication imp lied algebra two part term usually written right next times symbol number part pretty number like number part official cal led coefficient another cool math word use impress friend music crowd said coefficient silence chirping variable part term little made one variable raised variable part could x squared variable raised power variable part could remember learned last video realize also variable raised power power since exponent change anything need actually show variable part term could tricky combination variable raised x squared times squared times b squared times c cube term number variable like good news time need deal term one variable maybe two complicated problem soh one thing point move term like even though would fine multiplication way around write conventional always write number part term first variable part term basic idea term little term learn minute first let see basic idea term help us understand basic idea polynomial polynomial combination many term sit kind like chain term linked together addition subtraction term contain multiplication term polynomial must either addition subtraction polynomial made number term together specific used describe polynomial certain number one term really chain call monomial prefix mono mean one two term call binomial prefix b mean two three term call trinomial since prefix tri mean three beyond three term usually say polynomial since poly mean many fact common simply use term polynomial even basic idea polynomial series term together addition subtraction let see typical example polynomial help us learn little term x squared plus x minus many term polynomial well based learned far probably quit sure term part together addition subtraction three look like something missing last two middle term missing number part last term missing variable part seem fit original definition term well middle term easy explain really number part remember always factor number since multiplying effect number variable need show see term polynomial variable part know number part coefficient term last term missing variable part well little remember last video exponent algebra learned number variable raised power equal mean think last term variable x raised power since would always equal really variable true sense word effect value term make sense especially remember rule last video rule say number raised power help us see middle term basically raised power see pattern term number part term variable part raised power since x x x anything polynomial get simplified longer look exactly like pattern comes oh last one truly variable cal led constant term value always stays know polynomial let talk important property term polynomial cal led degree might sound like use measure temperature angle degree talking different degree term determined power variable part example term since power variable say degree term degree term term power variable degree term likewise would degree term would degree term oh suppose could call term variable part zero degree term usually refer red constant term thing little complicated term one variable case add variable get degree term since term degree term care degree term swell polynomial often refer red degree highest term polynomial contain degree term higher term cal led degree polynomial highest term degree term cal led degree polynomial another reason care degree term help us decide arrangement polynomial arrange term polynomial order highest degree know mathematician like keep thing let example polynomial highest degree term left lo west degree term right course every polynomial term every degree degree polynomial still put order highest lo west even though term missing fifth come minus finally plus way totally fine polynomial missing term like sometimes helpful think missing term coefficient coefficient term zero whole term value zero effect polynomial speaking need rearrange polynomial term order highest degree lo west degree highest degree term squared move front polynomial important notice got minus sign front normally see minus sign think subtraction comes polynomial sit best think minus sign negative sign mean term right negative value negative coefficient fact instead thinking polynomial term added subtract edit best think term added term either positive negative coefficient determined operator right front term example polynomial treat term added together use sign directly front term tell positive negative term first term coefficient negative negative term next term coefficient positive positive next term coefficient negative negative constant term positive positive negative coefficient help us lot polynomial mixture positive negative term like example think negative sign front squared term part coefficient realize move front polynomial negative sign come come really negative term bring negative sign along positive term would actually change value polynomial addition helping us rearrange treating polynomial combination positive negative term helpful need simplify happen subject next basic algebra video alright learned lot polynomial video little might take time make sense remember always watch video practice problem help sink always thanks watching math antic see ya next time learn algebra basic
