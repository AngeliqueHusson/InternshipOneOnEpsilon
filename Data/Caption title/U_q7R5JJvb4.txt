You may have been wondering , why do integrals always have that dx at the end ? And what isthat dx , anyway ? Well , there are a few answers to that question . Just like withanything else in math , your understanding of dx will get more and more complete as youget to higher and higher levels of math . A simplified , incomplete understanding of dxmight serve you best when you 're just starting out with integrals , but you 'll need a moreaccurate understanding as you go along . So let 's start with the simplest answer , andthen peel away the first few layers of the onion.Answer number one : dx is just notation . In other words , the integral symbol , and thedx , are like bookends that frame the function that 's supposed to be integrated . That functionin the middle is called the integrand , by the way . Basically the integral symbol andthe dx just work together to say , integrate whatever 's between us.Answer number two : The dx tells you which variable to integrate . If it 's a dx , you'resupposed to integrate with respect to x . If you had a dt instead , then you 'd integratewith respect to t. In other words , the integral symbol tells you to integrate the function , and the dx tells you to do so with respect to the variable x . That 's why the variablein the integrand usually matches the variable in the dx , or dt , or d anything.Now you might ask , why do I need the dx to tell me which variable to integrate , whenthe function only has an x in it in the first place ? Great question ! And you 're right . Insingle variable calculus , the dx , or dt , or d whatever , feels a little irrelevant , becauseif there 's only one variable in the integrand , then you already know which variable to integrate.It 's pretty obvious that you would integrate f of x with respect to x , f of t with respectto t , or f of theta with respect to theta . But here 's why it 's going to matter later.When you get to multivariable calculus , and you have more than one variable inside thefunction , you 'll need to know which variable to integrate , and that dx , or dt , or dy , willbe an absolute necessity . As an example , this double integral is telling you to integratefirst with respect to y , and then later with respect to x.Answer number three , the hardest , but best answer : dx is a differential , which meansthat it represents the difference between two things . So more specifically , it representsthe distance between two values of x . But while capital Dx is usually used to representany distance large or small , lowercase dx is what we use to specifically represent aninfinitely small distance between two x-values . In other words , the distance between two x-valuesthat are so close together , you care barely tell them apart.For some of you this might be yesterday , but think back to whenever you learned differentmethods for approximating the area under a curve , like Riemann sums and Trapezoidal rule.Those rules used a bunch of rectangles , or trapezoids , to approximate the area underthe curve . You just find the area of each rectangle , and then add all those areas together.Those methods rely on a consistent width for each rectangle . That width is called deltax , and delta x is just the distance between each x-value.So what happens to delta x when we want to try to find exact area , instead of just anestimation ? Well , the integral is what 's going to give us exact area , but the reason it givesexact area is because we change delta x to dx when we switch from the sum to the integral ! Where delta x was the width of a rectangle , using dx instead of delta x makes the widthof each rectangle infinitely small . Since the dx is the only thing that makes thoserectangles infinitely thin , it 's the only way for us to get to exact area . Which iswhy when you take the integral , and you're finding exact area , it always has to be accompaniedby that dx.Could you use some extra help with math ?
