video want talk trinomial trial error particular going factor quadratic expression even even u h problem look know probably bad right arent big tedious likewise doesnt necessarily doesnt work doesnt mean doesnt necessarily factor mean going factor nice rational basically going mean let talk tedious procedure unfortunately extremely common type going life always fa irok going going make set parentheses going put two term set parentheses distribute everything want get know plus x minus want get back k multiply first two term going try get well way get x squared would x x least use know whole likewise get thing really use whole k far good put put set parentheses going multiply together give us negative already get little tricky thinking multiply negative well theres positive theres negative likewise negative one positive four would work also could use two would multiply give looking multiply negative four whatever constant already well three know three problem know put positive one negative four second multiply check thing put minus four first spot positive one second spot sense know really going lots different set going sort look one way flip way saying get really tedious factor nicely theyll either positive negative negative positive set say maybe theres negative positive likewise maybe flip positive first negative second well negative positive negative could flip negative positive already theres sort six going check fun part theres guarantee even work theres guarantee dont work doesnt mean doesnt factor unfair going going start check ing going look first first ill use positive first set parentheses ill use filling basically filling positive going use x minus going multiply think give plus x minus times x get times negative thats negative ill get positive x inside negative combine like term think well get squared minus want positive tell tell well thats correct factorization know particular combination work go next one x well maybe ill try minus plus distribute ill get ill get positive inside ill get negative look like get negative combine middle term sorry got cut little bit combine middle term minus negative x want positive x close cigar mean doesnt work k particular combination work let try let carry one know going work video wont drag forever try x maybe jump positive first set parentheses x minus set parentheses multiply ill get times x get times negative negative inside get positive get hey simplify get squared negative plus positive x minus mean found correct factorization x plus positive minus kind know jump gun little bit know could checked found didnt work know hopefully didnt check negative negative finally got one see already tedious worst part going number front x squared lots look different combination one aswell definitely something thats giving think algebra headache long time take lot practice know even still sometimes see one take know little bit time play get correct know point comfortable relatively quick arithmetic still find tedious dont practice practice practice think thats really type right hope sense looking constant factor leading coefficient hopefully stumble upon right one factor ing trinomial quadratic trinomial trial error factor ing trinomial quadratic trinomial trial error factor ing trinomial quadratic trinomial trial error factor ing trinomial quadratic trinomial trial error factor ing trinomial quadratic trinomial trial error factor ing trinomial quadratic trinomial trial error factor ing trinomial quadratic trinomial trial error
