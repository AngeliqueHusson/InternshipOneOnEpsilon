factor ing trinomial ready class say math say k many home wondering student jacket dont blend back head look yeah right oh yeah wrapped another class go g squared plus plus right question already love go trinomial good trinomial polynomial equation three polynomial many term equation dont know type trinomial type polynomial excellent hear someone said taking fantastic thats great said first thing first common factor common factor start factor ing process alright boiling process f times f times squared ah saying yeah next index like side thing one times one seven x squared would x x x x clear next good star ted going go one times think yeah two two four four one way want let try tell let two go right let foil dude foil check forget even though positive squared right squared times x x somehow add let try one like game show let try want put four think think tell want put four yeah yeah one second one one interesting put word good put um oh oh love moment oh good l four times right right would plus void oh exactly exactly going say oh say intention yeah good good right let make oil check squared x x x x yes reason reason yeah parentheses bigger like inside seven yeah multiply seven make needs one may first parentheses would right put four four would x would x ill make usually put thank know depend middle term celebrated put bigger number mean put bigger number still laughing thats awesome many factor still many factor two two factor factor say solve anything times going set first factor x plus question yes best question thats answer answer solve x need solve absolutely done resent h factor zero x plus zero think everyone writing dont see everyone writing look oh yeah saw go negative hum one sixteenth mouse word great great right k two answer solve already gon na ready ready game please dont giggle really awesome ladies gentle men giggle sok solve may five refine right solve need set equation equal zero make side equal zero please add three eight nine sport wait wait wait please wait three sides well stance want set times zero combine tutor added sides subtract oh leaving us minus equal zero right common oh yeah yeah oh wait nothing goes right go times squared think yes na possible might even answer recommendation try make instead support case generally generally going right right would work part experience less extreme think tonight likely let put going leave sign volunteer foil check check yes squared hey square good six eight six nine nine good news good news great news right thats good thats positive right good news great negative positive add negative six yes front six front six two negative front twelve positive right go twelve positive positive create twelve hope see wait first one second one right way check four times three twelve eight thats wherein foiling thing right make negative six want say dont like want say negative put negative front right cool negative times positive negative good check works question yes would worked like interesting question worked weve done eight theres one answer right good news theres one answer going take put line whatever check one step away yeah yeah oh yeah find whats four minus three zero right yeah minus equal plus solve going ped mode go plus plus equal equal right lap dont mode dont speak wish speak yes yeah hey shut bilingual game would say hey ill watch good bring us great class enter negative halves right good set right set factor theres common factor factor try less extreme like six times two squared minus equal cal led three going factor whats first step common factor one yeah yeah wait common factor theres x first one hey whats common factor three term wasnt goes anything else going yeah number whole un distribute times ya squared squared x minus seven x minus minus l right also great news becomes much easier factor much easier alright trinomial cant take factor turn college would good question right write oh yeah yeah yeah part times squared yes x right oh yeah next one times six think six one two three want feeling well look put make x sit yeah put ill x oh hope omega killing yeah three two two link thats tutor let try want put let try right let try understanding multiplying make time right foil got keep cool let see works see boil middle squared r number six ah yes process well take question squared exact x x somehow combine make let try matter order matter snow right format go give try someone else foil check please yes um six act swell let um justice oh whats ready squared squared x right good news right one needs negative one needs positive make negative hear negative needs negative two needs positive needs negative let let us think make negative make x strip yeah good oh right check negative negative cool x needs positive confirmation also times negative step negative reason like beginning anything correct anything ignore face ill tell yeah dont get used six one wouldnt work tying paper wouldnt work going one answer far good question yes yes didnt talk whatever solution would still able factor yes yes would still able factor would bigger one one would doubled distribute saying six beginning x hear saying oka yis take toit right solve two extraneous meaning unnecessary really affecting problem rule math divide sides two divided sides two would happen two theyre cancel ling savior would cancel zero would stay zero fantastic wow would make write cant sort ignore equation ignore yeah dividing cancel anyway cant say bye say bye slice yeah say bye equation say bye technically whats happening dividing two want know let rewrite plus minus set factor zero x minus equal zero alright x equal negative hopefully solve track two sides divide sides done add three sides three guy skip ped step reim giving credit able solve simple equation time thing much past twenty thirty nine twenty thirty nine right thats good place cut question let read put oh yeah say good bye would say bye mad much like car still done
