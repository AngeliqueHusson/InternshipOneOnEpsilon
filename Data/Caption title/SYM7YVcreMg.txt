welcome in 1834 German mathematician bythe name of Jewish lay which sounds veryFrench outlined a very simple principlehe called it the shoe principle to drawprinciple and the ideas this is thefollowing suppose I have a whole bunchof boxes and a whole bunch of objectsand I want to put these objects in thoseboxes well if it turns out there aremore objects than there are boxes nomatter what I do I 'm in a situationwhere at least one box contains two ormore objects it 's impossible put moreobjects in there are boxes in such a waythat you can avoid that so there must bedouble double stacking going on thatreally stops taking in one box this isalso called the cubbyhole principle orthe pigeonhole principle because if youhave home pigeons they live in cabbyholes and the idea is I have morepictures than there are Kobe holes forthem no matter how the pigeons arrangethemselves in these cubby holes for morepigeons and holes at least one boxescontain two or more pigeons thepigeonhole principle now this principleis very very powerful and to express itspower I can actually are rephrase thisin a different way and I wrote this inbeforehand in my terrible handwritinghere 's another way to say the pigeonholeprinciple I 'm going to do it in terms oflabels suppose there are more than nobjects that each to be assigned a labeland there 's only n labels so you gotmore objects than our labels well thenobviously whatever you do there 's sureto be at least two objects with the samelabel this is some wonderful musicconsequences I 'm going to label thepeople of New York City and I 'm going togive each person a label and theirlabels going to be a number which willbe the number of hairs on his or herhead now I happen to know that the humanhead has at most a hundred and fiftythousand hairs or something like that sothe possible labels a person could havein New York City is 0 4 no hairs on thehead 1 2 all the way to say abouthundred 50,000 so these are the possiblelabels but having to know there 's morepeople in New York City than 102,000peopleso by this pigeonhole principle saysthere are more people given these labelsto people must be given at least atleast to be or must be given the samelabel that is they exist to people inNew York City with exactly the samenumber hairs onheads now this is the delightful thingabout mathematics I prove they exist butI 've given you absolutely no indicationhow to find these peoplethat 's not bad petitioners problemmathematicians just like to prove thingsare there to be foundall right so I have a whole host of waysto think about the pigeonhole principleand chapter 20 of this thinkingmathematics series so it 's that book isavailable volume two on the website butI want to just get to one that solves apuzzle I put out there and the puzzle isthe followingdoo doo doo doo and when I say out thereI mean on various forms and so forthhere are the powers of 3 1 3 9 27 81 243729 and so on and I want to know do anyof these powers of 3 ever end in 0 1 soI wan na know do they end in 0 1 and Ican actually use the pigeonholeprinciple to solve this and I 'm gon na doit he goes under a sign each number inthis infinite list a label and the labelis going to be its remainder upondivision by a hundred so I 'm going todivide each of these by 100 so example243 upon division 500 least theremainder 43 so label that 43 729 Lee'sremainder of 29:27 Lee 's are made of 27so I drew this for the my infinite listwell if I divided by hundreds only thesepossible night that remainders only gotthe label scuse me from 0 1 2 3 up to 99so I only have a hundred possible labelsfor infinite set of numbers so thatmeans there 's going to be two powers of3 with exactly the same label that isthere 's gon na be a power 3 3 to the athat has some label K and that meansit 's who made a point of it division by100 is K so it must be some more per 100plus K and there 's gon na be another onesuch that it has the same remainder upondivision by a hundred so it 's also aremainder of K so that means I'veestablished it 's established by thepigeonhole principle that exists twopowers of three that lead the sameremain upon division by 100 if Isubtract themlet 's change colored pin nouns to it inlime green for fun that means three tothe a minus three to the B will be caseor cancel some multiple of a hundred allright let 's just assume that we arrangethese said that the first power three isthe bigger one than three of the B 's thesecond one so I can pull out a commonfactor of 3 to the be at least three tothe B and three of the a minus B minusone is a hundred times our let me playwith that equation now that means theleft hand side is a model of hundreds100 times some it 's a hundred goes intothe left hand side somehow well I'mgonna use the properties are primes hereknowing that hundreds of made of twosand fives there 's no way that any partof 100 is used in this first part threeto the B so that means a hundred isgoing into all the second part throughthe a minus B minus one so you must havebit more space just to get rid of thisthat tells me that our whoops pen pleaseand I do n't like one Creole go over toblue that that means that this partthrees the a minus B minus one is thepart with a hundred in it so that twomust be a hundred times something let'scall it t let 's add one to both sides sothat means this power of three is of theform 100 T plus one well anymore pool of100 ends in zero zero and I add one itmeans this guy is ending in zero one soyes there does exist a power of threethat ends in zero one in fact there'snothing special about 100 in this puzzleI could 've done a thousand and find thatthere must exist a power through the endtriple zero zero one or we 've done amillion there must be a power to be theends in 0 0 0 0 0 1 and so onthis is sneaky use of the pigeonholeprinciple alright I think I 'm runningout of time I only got a few minutes letme just end off with just a cute littlepuzzle I 'm wondering in your locallibrary must there be two books the samenumber of pages in it how could you usethe prints help pinch and hold principleto think about that must there be twobooks in your local library with exactlythe same number of pages all right Pigeon Hole Principle (TANTON Mathematics) Pigeon Hole Principle (TANTON Mathematics) Pigeon Hole Principle (TANTON
