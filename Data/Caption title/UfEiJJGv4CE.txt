DR JAMES GRIME : So today , I want to tell you that almostall integers contain the digit 3.So the integers are the whole numbers.So I 'm saying that almost all whole numberscontain the digit 3.It sounds strange , does n't it ? Yeah , because I can think of infinitely many numbers thatcontain a 3.I 've got 3 , 33 , 333 , 3,333 , and so on.I can think of infinitely many numbers thatdo n't contain a 3.7 , 77 , 777 , and 7,777 , and so on.So how can almost all integers contain the digit 3 ? So 23 contains the digit 3.310 contains the digit 3.9,002,023.So what about the numbers less than 10 ? How many numbers less than 10 contain the digit 3 ? It 's just 3 , is n't it ? Yeah , it 's just one of them.Right.So one of those , just the number 3 itself.So what 's the proportion of numbers ? Well , it 's one out of ten.So it 's 1/10.It 's 0.1.It 's 10 % .What 's the next size up ? Let 's look at numbers less than 100.We 've got 3.We 've got 13 , 23 , 43 , 53 , 63 , 73 , 83 , 93.You may have noticed I skipped off the 30s there.So we 've got 30 , 31 , 32 , 33 , 34 , 35 -- so I reckon we 've got 19.19 out of 100 , that 's 0.19.It 's 19 % is what I 'm saying.So the percentage has gone up.Let 's try numbers less than 1,000.Well , we 've got the 19 we said already , right ? But we 've got all those numbers again , but with a 1 in front.Like it 's 103 and 113 and then we get 200 and something.We get 400 and something , 500 , 600 , 700 , 800 , 900.And then we can include all the 300s , which I skipped there.So just the 300 , 301 , 302 , 303 , right ? So it 's 271.What 's the percentage ? It 's about 0.271 -- 27 % .It 's going up.Now , did you notice the trick that we usedfor that last one ? I said , think of all the numbers with a 1 in the front.It was the same copy but with a 1 in the front , with a 2 inthe front , and then it was all the 300s.You can do this in general.The numbers containing a digit 3 -- let 's call that T for 3.Let 's call these 10.Less than 10 to the power n.So these are the numbers containing a digit 3 , lessthan 10 to the power n.If you want to find the next one -- andthat 's going to be 10,000.You take the last of your previous number , times it by9 , and add on 10 to the power n.And you can find the next number.You can do that.So that would be the next one we 're looking for.So there 's a little formula there.So let 's do it.All right then , I 'm going to use my calculator.So 9 times 271 , plus 1,000.And I get that number , 3,439.What 's the proportion ? It 's about 0.3439.It 's going up all the time -- about 34 % now.It 's going up all the time.In fact , there 's a nice way to work out how many numbersthere 're going to be with a 3.Imagine if I was allowed to write my numbers like this , with zeroes.So that would be a zero , but with all these zeroes there.This is a four-digit number.So here 's another one , and here 's another one.How many four-digit numbers are there ? It 's actually 10 to the power 4.10 choices there , 10 choices there , 10 choices , 10 choices.How many of them do n't have a 3 ? Well , if I 'm not allowed to use 3 , then I only have ninechoices for that place , nine choices for that place , ninechoices for that place , nine choices for that place.So that would be 9 to the power 4.If you want to find out how many integers that contain thedigit 3 , it is 10 to the power n , minus 9 to the power n.See , these are all my n-digit numbers minus the ones thatdo n't contain a 3.The proportion , then , is going to be this thing divided bythis thing -- just 10 to the n.So it 's this.And what is that proportion ? 10 to the n divided by 10 to the n is 1 , minus 9 to the ndivided by 10 to the n.Here 's another way to write that -- 9/10 to the n.That 's the proportion that contain a digit 3.And just what happens ? Well , as this gets really , really big , this fraction getssmaller and smaller and smaller.And it will go to 1.That will disappear.It will barely be worth mentioning.And that is 1.So it goes to 1 -- we say , as n gets big.So this is getting closer and closer to 1 minus 0.As that gets closer to 0 , as it gets big , this gets closerand closer to 1 minus 0.So the whole thing is going towards 100 % .100 % of numbers contain the digit 3.And this is the proper technical definition of when Isaid almost all numbers contain the digit 3 . `` Almost all '' sounds like a wishy-washy vague expression.But in mathematics , it has a proper meaning.It means that the proportion is going toward 100 % as youget more and more numbers.BRADY HALAN : Would it be equally true to say almost allnumbers contain the number 5 ? DR JAMES GRIME : That would be equally true.And you can do the exact same thing to say almost allnumbers contain a 5 . 3 is everywhere - Numberphile 3 is everywhere - Numberphile 3 is everywhere - Numberphile
