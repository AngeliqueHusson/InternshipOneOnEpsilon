Write the prime factorization of 75.Write your answer using exponential notation.So we have a couple of interesting things here.Prime factorization , and they say exponential notation.We 'll worry about the exponential notation later.So the first thing we have to worry about is what is even aprime number ? And just as a refresher , a prime number is a numberthat 's only divisible by itself and one , so examples ofprime numbers -- let me write some numbers down.Prime , not prime . So 2 is a prime number.It 's only divisible by 1 and 2.3 is another prime number.Now , 4 is not prime , because this isdivisible by 1 , 2 and 4.We could keep going.5 , well , 5 is only divisible by 1 and 5 , so 5 is prime.6 is not prime , because it's divisible by 2 and 3.I think you get the general idea.You move to 7 , 7 is prime.It 's only divisible by 1 and 7.8 is not prime.9 you might be tempted to say is prime , but remember , it'salso divisible by 3 , so 9 is not prime.Prime is not the same thing as odd numbers.Then if you move to 10 , 10 is also not prime , divisible by 2 and 5.11 , it 's only divisible by 1 and 11 , so 11 isthen a prime number.And we could keep going on like this.People have written computer programs looking for thehighest prime and all of that.So now that we know what a prime is , a primefactorization is breaking up a number , like 75 , into aproduct of prime numbers.So let 's try to do that.So we 're going to start with 75 , and I 'm going to do itusing what we call a factorization tree.So we first try to find just the smallest prime number thatwill go into 75.Now , the smallest prime number is 2.Does 2 go into 75 ? Well , 75 is an odd number , or the number in the ones place , this 5 , is an odd number.5 is not divisible by 2 , so 2 will not go into 75.So then we could try 3.Does 3 go into 75 ? Well , 7 plus 5 is 12.12 is divisible by 3 , so 3 will go into it.So 75 is 3 times something else.And if you 've ever dealt with change , you know that if youhave three quarters , you have 75 cents , or if you have 3times 25 , you have 75.So this is 3 times 25.And you can multiply this out if you do n't believe me.Multiple out 3 times 25.Now , is 25 divisible by -- you can give up on 2.If 75 was n't divisible by 2 , 25 's not going to be divisibleby 2 either.But maybe 25 is divisible by 3 again.So if you take the digits 2 plus 5 , you get 7.7 is not divisible by 3 , so 25 will not be divisible by 3.So we keep moving up : 5.Is 25 divisible by 5 ? Well , sure.It 's 5 times 5.So 25 is 5 times 5.And we 're done with our prime factorization because now wehave all prime numbers here.So we can write that 75 is 3 times 5 times 5.So 75 is equal to 3 times 5 times 5.We can say it 's 3 times 25.25 is 5 times 5.3 times 25 , 25 is 5 times 5.So this is a prime factorization , but they wantus to write our answer using exponential notation.So that just means , if we have repeated primes , we can writethose as an exponent.So what is 5 times 5 ? 5 times 5 is 5 multiplied by itself two times.This is the same thing as 5 to the second power.So if we want to write our answer using exponentialnotation , we could say this is equal to 3 times 5 to thesecond power , which is the same thing as 5 times 5 .
