the golden ratios mentioned in Euclid'selements in 300 BC then throughouthistory different mathematicians havedone work with the golden ratio and infact here is one of the Islamicmathematicians working in Baghdad Iraqin the year 1150 and he gives the goldenratio as square root 125 minus 5 dividedby 15 minus square root 125 so here'sour version of the simplified form ofthe golden ratio what we want to do issee if we ca n't take this and turn itinto this to show that he was correct inhis expression for the golden ratio sowe can use our properties of radicalslet 's take his expression right here andthe first thing we want to do issimplify square root 125 so I know that125 is 25 times 5 so I 'll take that 25that 's 25 out as square root 25 which is5 right square root 125 in simplifiedform is 5 square root 5 minus 5 over 15minus again 5 square root 5 so I 'm justgoing to continue to simplify thisexpression until I get down to somethingthat looks like this golden ratio or beable to show that it 's not the goldenratio well let 's see I have a 5 commonto the numerator and denominator solet 's take this over here I 'll factorout a 5 from the numerator I get squareroot 5 minus 1 I 'll factor out a 5 fromthe denominator and I 'll have 5 times 3minus square root 5 ok so I can see thatI can divide out those 5s right thereand now I have left square root 5 minus1 over 3 minus square root of 5 that'sabout as simple as this can is going toget when I look back to my expressionfor the golden ratio right here I see Ijust have a rational number just aninteger in the denominator so when Ilook at this I say well let 's see if Ican do that same thing get some integerdown here by getting rid of the squareroot 5 I do that by rationalizing thedenominator so I 'm going to multiplynumerator and denominator of this by theconjugate of this 10so 3 plus we 're refined if I do that tothe denominator I 'll do the same thingto the numerator so I 'm essentiallymultiplying this expression right hereby the number 1 so I know I wo n't changeits value now let 's just go ahead andmultiply it so I 'm going to have squareroot 5 times 3 3 square root 5 squareroot 5 times square root 5 that 'll bejust fineminus 1 times 3 minus 3 minus 1 timessquare root 5 minus square root 5 andthen in the denominator you know whenyou multiply conjugates 3 minus squareroot 5 times 3 plus square root 5 I getthe first term squared minus the secondterm squared so I 'm going to end up with9 minus square root 5 squared which is 5okay so it looks like I 'm getting therelet 's see what do we have here 3 squareroot 5 minus square root 5 that 's goingto be 2 square root 5 5 subtract 3 is 2and in the denominator here 9 minus 5 isgoing to be 4 ok I see I have a toocommon to the numerator and a too commonto the denominator I 'll factor that 2out and I end up with 2 times squareroot 5 plus 1 all divided by 2 times 2I 'll divide those two twos out and I'llchange the order of the numerator justso it looks like my version of thegolden ratio and end up with 1 plussquare root 5 over 2 okay 1 plus squareroot 5 over 2 exactly the same thing sohe was right this is an expression forthe golden ratio and I can show this byusing my properties of radicals now Ilike this this problem in my classesbecause it really has everything I wantmy students to know about radicals aboutyou know simplifying by factoring acommon factor out of the numerator anddenominator and reducing to lowest termsrationalizing the denominator heremultiplying binomials prescience herewith radicals and then again simplifyingby factoring theand denominator and dividing out thatcommon factor the more these kind ofthings we do in class the better off mystudents are and it will keep them fromtrying to divide out just little partsof this right here by doing it thecorrect way by factoring out thenumerator and denominator dividing outcommon factors so it 's no accident thatthis kind of mathematics is going on inBaghdad Iraq in the year 1150 as amatter of fact you ca n't tell the storyof mathematics and algebra in particularwithout going through Baghdad Iraq infact the first algebra book comes out ofBaghdad about two hundred years beforethis so it 's very interesting storymaybe in one of the later videos willtell that story but in any case goodpractice here with the properties ofradicals and taking this expression andshowing that it actually is the goldenratio The Golden Ratio in 1150 The Golden Ratio in 1150 The Golden Ratio in 1150
