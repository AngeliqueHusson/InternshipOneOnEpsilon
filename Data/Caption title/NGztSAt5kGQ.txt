hello this is pressure Locker and thisis part two of the five-part series onhow to solve the Rubik 's Cube in thisvideo we 're going to go over the movenotation which will be extremelyimportant to understanding the sequencesof moves in the lair methodbefore we get started solving the cube Iwant to explain rubik 's cube movenotation this will be extremelyimportant for following the directionsin the remaining videos we orient thecube dependent on the face we 're lookingat if we rotate the face we 're lookingat 90 degrees clockwise that move iscalled F if we do F a second time thatrotates at 90 degrees clockwise oncemore this is F a third time and here 's Fa fourth time which brings the frontface back to its original position if werotate the front face ninety degreescounterclockwise that 's known as F primeor F inverse and similarly we can keepdoing this multiple times so here 's Fprime done three times and here 's Fprime for fourth time the other sides ofthe cube are given positions relative tothe face or looking at for example if welook at the face to the right of theface we 're looking at the side to theright of what we 're looking at a 90degrees clockwise move is denoted R 4right we can repeat the move of our 4times and bring the right side back tothe original position there 's also themove of our prime or our inverse whichis a 90 degrees counterclockwise movethe side which is on the left of whatwe 're looking at we can move it the moveL is a 90 degrees clockwise moverelative to that faceso after repeatedly doing L four timeswe get back to the original position Lprime is counterclockwise and we canrepeatedly do that move to change theleft side the side which is on the topor up this is the move U which is a 90degrees clockwise move and here we bringyou once more and bring it back to theoriginal position if we rotate the upperface 90 degrees counterclockwisethat 's u prime or u inversefinally there 's the side which is downthe bottom side will call down so themove of D is a 90 degrees clockwise moveof the bottom side of the cube relativeto what we 're looking at similarly if wego counterclockwise 90 degrees that willbe down inverse or down Primethere 's also a back face and you couldsimilarly add notation to that but we'renot going to need it for any of themoves in our videos I hope you like thisvideo please click through to watch thenext video which explains how to solvethe first layer of the cube pleasesubscribe to my channel you can supportme on patreon for exclusive rewardscatch me on my blog mind your decisionson Twitter at pressure locker and youcan get my books listed on my website Solve The Rubik's Cube - Move Notation (Part 2/5) Solve The Rubik's Cube - Move Notation (Part 2/5) Solve The Rubik's Cube - Move Notation (Part 2/5)
