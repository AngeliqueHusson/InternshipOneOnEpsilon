how do we reduce the number sixty-twoits prime factors using the factor treeapproach we first need to write this asa product of any two numbers we canwrite it as six times ten six and tenare basically two of the many factors of60 if the factors we get are prime westar as six as well as ten are not primewe again try to write them as a productof two numbers six can be written as aproduct of two and three and ten can bewritten as a product of two and five asall of them are prime we can be surethat 60 can be written as a product ofthese prime numbers it 's simple 60 canbe written as 2 times 2 times 3 times 5but the important question is where elsedoes prime factorization help us look atthe factor tree we can say that 2 is afactor of 6 we can also say that 6 is afactor of 60 and do n't forget 2 is alsoa factor of 60 if a is a factor of B andB is a factor of C then a will also be afactor of C let 's say somebody asks youa question is 15 a factor of 60 theanswer to that is yes if you 're able toform 15 by forming a product of any ofthe prime factors in this case we canform 15 by multiplying 3 with 5 so yes15 is a factor of 60 you would probablythink that dividing 60 by 15 was aneasier option here yes you 're correctbut you will realize the benefits ofthis method when the numbers are largeand difficult to divide reducing thenumbers to their prime factors alsohelps us find the HCF and LCM of numbersand guess what it also helps us buildfactorshow can we build factors we can buildfactors by forming all possible productsfrom these prime factors one of thepossible products is 2 times 3 we canalso write 2 times 2 or 2 times 5 oreven 3 times 5 or 2 times 3 times 2 oreven 3 times 2 times 5 or 2 times 2times 5 these are the only possiblecombinations of products 7 in all doesthat mean 60 has only 7 factors probablynotdo n't forget the individual primefactors 2 3 & 5 10 factors in all don'tforget the number itself is also afactor 60 is a factor of 60 and 1 is afactor of every number that completesthe list the number 60 has 12 factors inall these were few of the ways in whichprime factorization helps usyou How does Prime Factorization help us?
