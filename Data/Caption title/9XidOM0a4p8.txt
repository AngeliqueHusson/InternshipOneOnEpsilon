we 've been enough in measurement for alittle while now imagine all kinds ofthings we 'll be measuring perimetersareas all kinds of different shapes thatwe 've been measuring right what 's themost recent one most recent countryround thing circles very good and welearnt that the perimeter around acircle in a special name what was itcalled a circumference very good and itsarea and its circumference has to dowith a special special number does it orin both special pies is weird numberright 3.1415 bla bla bla bla bla sostrange strangely so we 're we 're goingto move from there is now that I thinkabout border missions now moredimensions like before we get to that wemet a figure I want dimensions us whatis a division a dimension is a directionthat you can do one or two things in itsobjection you can move in or directionyou can measure it right a direction youcan move or measure in so for instance Icould say you know I I can move left andright along here right oh this is yourleft right and this is your right okaysomething back and forth it back beforeso in some ways I 've got one dimensionto make an interval on here okay onemixtures from that side to this side andwe 've seen one dimensional things beforefor instance the number line right it'sgot zero in the middle okay and youremember we were covering integers okaygoing to the right you 've got like 1 2 34 5 etc and they 're going to the leftyou 've got all the negative numbers okayand left it right positive negativethat 's the only direction she 's goingyeah okay yeah so in this case what Imean by a direction is like it 's it'sthe line I could move like you can goback and forth but you 're still going inthe same along the same dimensionsame direction okay so in that case backand forth about different ways of movingalong the same way okay right so that'sour dimension is okay so therefore wemove to these things they 're all aboutmeasuring in different kinds ofdimensions right if a dimensionsinjection you can move a measure it okaythen a length a length is how much spacehow much space an object takes offI 'm just gon na write it like that anddo n't make any comment okay I like thishow much space an object takes off inone particular dimension okay superinstance for instance well we have alook at some of the shapes that we aremeasured in the last few lessons okayfor instance I can say all right is arectangle he 's a reckoning okaywhat did I say all right what did slinkwhat 's its name it 's like this how muchspace does this thing take up along thisdirection okay that 's what I made byit 's like oh I could have made this toolate that does n't matter I could justturn around the right thing okay sincehow much space it takes up do n't we goalong one particular line okay now thereason why this is a great definitioneven though it seems a bit like overlytechnical is because from thisdefinition we can make perfect sense ofarea and volume right if this is whatlength business that area is the samething the same thing how much space anobject takes up but it 's how much ittakes up in two dimensions instead ofone right it 's the same thing in twodimensions okay so for instance what arewe talking aboutJudis right if I said okay this thislength across here rather thanestimating I 'm just gon na actually madeso the length of this rectangle he isapproximately 25 centimeters okay26 right so I might say that is my unitof length okay but now if I go to areaand I 'm going in two dimensions I 've gotlength and I 've got width I need adifferent kind of unit if if life is ameasure it in one dimension righttherefore when we go into area I 'm gonnahave centimeters going this way and thenI 'm going to have centimeters going thisway as well right so for instance if Isaid before okay 26 centimeters andlet 's just say for instance that this is10 we know to multiply those we knowthat area is just you know length timeswidth or whatever it is we multiply thenumbers 2016 10 26 times 10 which ofcourse is just 60 right but we shouldalso multiply the units we 're gon na getcentimeters PG 260 centimeters squaredright like I could write centimeterstimes centimeters but we have like indexnotation which makes this a bit quickerand succinct yeah so now it 's just thenatural progression into this world thatwe inhabit right that a volume is againthe same thing how much space and objecttakes off it 's the same thing yeah inthree dimensions rather than in two orin one right so you know how I said ohthis dimension here I 've got like backand forth over here left and right whenwe add in area it 's not just left andright it 's up and down okay when we dovolume it needs to be another directionto go in right so it 's like if this ifthis rectangle could come off the boardlike into our 3d space like that yesokay I could go up and down right so andof course I 'm come closer and furtherright now therefore if you 've got liketwo 26 centimeters for 27 teams and 260centimeters squared because I 'm in twodimensions when you have volume youwould expect for instance suppose thisnow came out another I do n't know let'sjust say I did n't get very farjust two centimeters out from the boardokay I multiplied by the number twowhich would give me what 's double 260520 very good but I also multiply theunits - right I 've multiplied bycentimeters one more time which wouldmake it sense of meet is hugevery good so just like we saycentimeters we call these squarecentimeters we 'll call these cubiccentimeters right cubic cinnamon and infact on your book right now I 'd like youto get your ruler out get your lap I'mgonna do mine stupid it 's quit returnfor a small I 'd like you to draw a cubiccentimeter for me draw a cubiccentimeter so it should be 1 centimeterby 1 centimeter that 's the square of thefront right and then to make a cube outof it you 'd have to go one centimeterinto the page right which of course weca n't actually do but we could representit using lines that you try and mimicwhat 's going on so this is what we tryjust to zoom in What are length, area and volume? What are length, area and volume? What are length, area and volume?
