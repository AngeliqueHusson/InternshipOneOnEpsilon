We 're asked to write this right here in word form , andI 'm not saying it out loud because that would give theanswer away.We have 63.15 that we want to write in word form.Well , the stuff to the left of the decimal point is prettystraightforward.Let me actually color code it.So we have 6 , 3.Let me do it all in different colors.And then we have a decimal , and then we have a 1 and a 5.There 's one common way of doing this , but we 'll talkabout the different ways you could express this as a word.But we know how to write this stuff to the left.This is pretty straightforward.This is just sixty-three.Let me write that down.So this is sixty-three.And instead of the decimal , we 'll write , and.Now there 's two ways to go here.We could say , and one tenth and five hundredths , or wecould just say , look , this is fifteen hundredths.One tenth is ten hundredths.So one tenth and five hundredths is fifteenhundredths.So maybe I can write it like this : sixty-three and fifteenhundredths.Just like that.Now , it might have been a little bit more natural tosay , how come I do n't say one tenth and then fivehundredths ? And you could , but that would just make it a little bitharder for someone 's brain to process it when you say it.So it could have been sixty-three -- so let me copyand paste that.It could be sixty-three and , and then you would write , onetenth for this digit right there , and five hundredths.Sixty-three and one tenth and five hundredths is hard formost people 's brains to process.But if you say , fifteen hundredths , people get whatyou 're saying.Not to beat a dead horse , but this right here , this is 1/10right here and then this is 5/100 , 5 over 100.But if you were to add these two , If you were to add 1/10plus 5/100 -- so let 's do that.If you were to add 1/10 plus 5/100 , how would you do it ? You need a common denominator.100 is divisible by both 10 and 100 , so multiply both thenumerator and denominator of this character by 10.You get 10 on the top and 100 on the bottom.1/10 is the same thing as 10 over 100.10/100 plus 5/100 is equal to 15 over 100 , so this pieceright here is equal to 15/100.And that 's why we say sixty-three and fifteenhundredths .
