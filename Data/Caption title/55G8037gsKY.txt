In this video , I 'm going to do several examples of quadraticequations that are really of a special form , and it 's reallya bit of warm-up for the next video that we 're going to doon completing the square.So let me show you what I 'm talking about.So let 's say I have 4x plus 1 squared , minus8 is equal to 0.Now , based on everything we've done so far , you might betempted to multiply this out , then subtract 8 from theconstant you get out here , and then try to factor it.And then you 're going to have x minus something , times xminus something else is equal to 0.And you 're going to say , oh , one of these must be equal to0 , so x could be that or that.We 're not going to do that this time , because you mightsee something interesting here.We can solve this without factoring it.And how do we do that ? Well , what happens if we add 8 to bothsides of this equation ? Then the left-hand side of the equation becomes 4x plus 1squared , and these 8 's cancel out.The right-hand becomes just a positive 8.Now , what can we do to both sides of this equation ? And this is just kind of straight , vanillaequation-solving.This is n't any kind of fancy factoring.We can take the square root of both sides of this equation.We could take the square root.So 4x plus 1 -- I 'm just taking the square root of both sides.You take the square root of both sides , and , of course , you want to take the positive and the negative square root , because 4x plus 1 could be the positive square root of 8 , orit could be the negative square root of 8.So 4x plus 1 is equal to the positive or negativesquare root of 8.Instead of 8 , let me write 8 as 4 times 2.We all know that 's what 8 is , and obviously the square rootof 4x plus 1 squared is 4x plus 1.So we get 4x plus 1 is equal to -- we can factor out the 4 , or the square root of 4 , which is 2 -- is equal to the plus orminus times 2 times the square root of 2 , right ? Square root of 4 times square root of 2 is the same thing assquare root of 4 times the square root of 2 , plus orminus the square root of 4 is that 2 right there.Now , it might look like a really bizarro equation , withthis plus or minus 2 times the square of 2 , but it really isn't.These are actually two numbers here , and we 're actuallysimultaneously solving two equations.We could write this as 4x plus 1 is equal to the positive 2 , square root of 2 , or 4x plus 1 is equal to negative 2 timesthe square root of 2.This one statement is equivalent to this right here , because we have this plus or minus here , this or statement.Let me solve all of these simultaneously.So if I subtract 1 from both sides of thisequation , what do I have ? On the left-hand side , I'm just left with 4x.On the right-hand side , I have -- you ca n't reallymathematically , I mean , you could do them if you had acalculator , but I 'll just leave it as negative 1 plus orminus the square root , or 2 times the square root of 2.That 's what 4x is equal to.If we did it here , as two separate equations , same idea.Subtract 1 from both sides of this equation , you get 4x isequal to negative 1 plus 2 , times the square root of 2.This equation , subtract 1 from both sides.4x is equal to negative 1 minus 2 , times thesquare root of 2.This statement right here is completely equivalent to thesetwo statements.Now , last step , we just have to divide both sides by 4 , soyou divide both sides by 4 , and you get x is equal tonegative 1 plus or minus 2 , times the squareroot of 2 , over 4.Now , this statement is completely equivalent todividing each of these by 4 , and you get x is equal tonegative 1 plus 2 , times the square root 2 , over 4.This is one solution.And then the other solution is x is equal to negative 1 minus2 roots of 2 , all of that over 4.That statement and these two statements are equivalent.And if you want , I encourage you to -- let 's substitute oneof these back in , just so you feel confident that somethingas bizarro as one of these expressions can be a solutionto a nice , vanilla-looking equation like this.So let 's substitute it back in.4 times x , or 4 times negative 1 , plus 2 root 2 , over 4 , plus1 squared , minus 8 is equal to 0.Now , these 4 's cancel out , so you 're left with negative 1plus 2 roots 2 , plus 1 , squared , minus8 is equal to 0.This negative 1 and this positive 1 cancel out , soyou 're left with 2 roots of 2 squared , minus8 is equal to 0.And then what are you going to have here ? So when you square this , you get 4 times 2 , minus 8 isequal to 0 , which is true.8 minus 8 is equal to 0.And if you try this one out , you 're going to get the exactsame answer.Let 's do another one like this.And remember , these are special forms where we havesquares of binomials in our expression.And we 're going to see that the entire quadratic formulais actually derived from a notion like this , because youcan actually turn any , you can turn any , quadratic equationinto a perfect square equalling something else.We 'll see that two videos from now.But let 's get a little warmed up just seeingthis type of thing.So let 's say you have x squared minus 10x , plus 25 isequal to 9.Now , once again your temptation -- and it 's not abad temptation -- would be to subtract 9 from both sides , soyou get a 0 on the right-hand side , but before you do that , just inspect this really fast . And say , hey , is this justmaybe a perfect square of a binomial ? And you see -- well , what two numbers when I multiply them Iget positive 25 , and when I add them I get negative 10 ? And hopefully negative 5 jumps out at you.So this expression right here is x minus 5 , times x minus 5.So this left-hand side can be written as x minus 5 squared , and the right-hand side is still 9.And I want to really emphasize.I do n't want this to ruin all of the training you 've gottenon factoring so far.We can only do this when this is a perfect square.If you got , like , x minus 3 , times x plus 4 , and that wouldbe equal to 9 , that would be a dead end.You would n't be able to really do anythingconstructive with that.Only because this is a perfect square , can we now say x minus5 squared is equal to 9 , and now we can take the squareroot of both sides.So we could say that x minus 5 is equal to plus or minus 3.Add 5 to both sides of this equation , you get x is equalto 5 plus or minus 3 , or x is equal to -- what 's 5 plus 3 ? Well , x could be 8 or x could be equal to 5 minus 3 , or x isequal to 2.Now , we could have done this equation , this quadraticequation , the traditional way , the way you weretempted to do it.What happens if you subtract 9 from bothsides of this equation ? You 'll get x squared minus 10x.And what 's 25 minus 9 ? 25 minus 9 is 16 , and that would be equal to 0.And here , this would be just a traditional factoring problem , the type that we 've seen in the last few videos.What two numbers , when you take their product , you getpositive 16 , and when you sum them you get negative 10 ? And maybe negative 8 and negative 2jump into your brain.So we get x minus 8 , times x minus 2 is equal to 0.And so x could be equal to 8 or x could be equal to 2.That 's the fun thing about algebra : you can do things intwo completely different ways , but as long as you do them inalgebraically-valid ways , you 're not going to getdifferent answers.And on some level , if you recognize this , this is easierbecause you did n't have to do that little game in your head , in terms of , oh , what two numbers , when you multiplythem you get 16 , and when you add them you get negative 10 ? Here , you just said , OK , this is x minus 5 -- oh , I guess youdid have to do it.You had to say , oh , 5 times 5 is 25 , and negative 10 isnegative 5 plus negative 5.So I take that back , you still have to do that littlegame in your head.So let 's do another one.Let 's do one more of these , just to really get ourselvesnice and warmed up here.So , let 's say we have x squared plus 18x , plus 81 isequal to 1.So once again , we can do it in two ways.We could subtract 1 from both sides , or we could recognizethat this is x plus 9 , times x plus 9.This right here , 9 times 9 is 81 , 9 plus 9 is 18.So we can write our equation as x plus 9squared is equal to 1.Take the square root of both sides , you get x plus 9 isequal to plus or minus the square root of 1 , which is just 1.So x is equal to -- subtract 9 from both sides -- negative 9plus or minus 1.And that means that x could be equal to -- negative 9 plus 1is negative 8 , or x could be equal to -- negative 9 minus 1 , which is negative 10.And once again , you could have done this the traditional way.You could have subtracted 1 from both sides and you wouldhave gotten x squared plus 18x , plus 80 is equal to 0.And you 'd say , hey , gee , 8 times 10 is 80 , 8 plus 10 is18 , so you get x plus 8 , times x plus 10 is equal to 0.And then you 'd get x could be equal to negative 8 , or xcould be equal to negative 10.That was good warm up.Now , I think we 're ready to tackle completing the square .
