all right in this video we 're going tograph a piecewise function and in thispiecewise function we had a line we havea parabola and then we have a constantfunction which is going to be ahorizontal line and let 's just focus oneach piece individually hence the wordpiecewise function so look at this blueone right here let 's just think of it asbeing in y equals negative 1/2 X plus 3if you recall y equals MX plus B thisnumber right here this negative 1/2 isyour slope and this number 3 is youry-intercept let 's go ahead and plot thaty-intercept on our y-axis at 3 our slopeof negative 1 over 2 we can think ofthis as being two different ways butthey actually mean the same thing we canjust put that negative at either the topor the bottom going down 1 and right - Iwant to do that from this y interceptdown 1 right 2 is the same thing asgoing up one into the left 2 so we cando that so this right here is well up 1left 2 up 1 left 2 and the reason whyI 'm going further over here on whatexplain why from our piecewise functionnotice I 'm putting a bunch of dots youwant to put this mini but it never hurtsnice a straight line so let 's go aheadand graph this line and I want to stopit right there the reason why I want tostop it right here is look at thisdomain over here we only want to usethis line when X is less than or equalto negative 2 well let 's look at this xvalue right here this x value isnegative 1 negative 2 let 's look at thisx value right here it is negative 1 2 3negative 4 let 's look at this next valueright here negative 1 2 3 4 5 negative 6notice all these X values that I'mmentioning along this line all those Xvalues are less than or equal tonegative 2 so we do n't need these dotshere that just helped us graph that linenow what do we want to do about thisequal to symbol that you see right hereyou want to emphasize that with a nicesolidit 's nothing special about it but whenyou 're graphing this especially usingpencil and paper techniques you want toemphasize that at this equal to you wantto use a closed dot and I tell you whatyou do n't I 'm gon na erase these just tomake it look nice and clean you canleave them there if you want yourteachers might want to count it wrongbut just clean it up a little bit nowkeep in mind that this line does go onforever in this direction because allthese X values as we move to the left orthis line shoots this way all those Xvalues are less than or equal tonegative 2 so our blue line is donelet 's move on to our parabola now if youforgot how to grab a parabola lucky forus we have another technique to help usdo this and it 's a t-chart we can plotsome points now you do n't want to plugin points like negative 5 negative 4negative 3 there 's no need to waste timeon those and the reason why I say thatis because look at your domain in yourpiecewise function you only want to usethis parabola when negative 2 is lessthan X is less than or equal to 3basically what this means is you want touse numbers for X between negative 2 and3 so let 's write down some numbers howabout negative 2 negative 1 0 1 2 & 3now we 're gon na be careful with thiswhen I 'm gon na come back to this one wegot to plot it but let 's still plug inall these numbers one at a time let'splug them into here so start withnegative 2 negative 2 squared is 4 4minus 5 negative 1 plug in a negative 1into this negative 1 squared is positive1 1 minus 5 gives you negative 4plugging in 0 0 square root of 0 minus 5gives you negative 5 plugging in 1 1squared is 1 minus 5 gives you negative4 plug in 2 2 squared is 4 minus 5 givesyou negative 1 plugging in 3 3 squaredis 9 9 minus 5 gives you 4 let 's get inplot these ordered pairs notice we dohave a x and a y and this first onesince I hope that 's the first one I seewe do n't want to put a closed dot onthis notice you do n't see a equal tosymbol so we do n't want X to be equal tonegative- but we still want to emphasize thisordered pair at negative 2 negative 1let 's let 's use an open circle for thatbecause we do n't have that equal to itwas n't there just like that it 's notreally there so we use an open circleand we do n't see the equal to symbollet 's plot the rest of these negative 1negative 4 so negative 1 negative 1 2 34 right therenext one 0 negative 5 it 's gon na beright here 1 negative 4 so we got 1negative 4 right there 2 negative 1 1 2negative 1 right there and then 3 4 so 21 2 3 up 1 2 3 4 now when you 're makingyour parabola do n't do it with straightlines make it look nice and smooth witha nice curve or do the best you cansomething like this yeah make it niceand smooth that 's good enough all rightthere 's our parabola again since wedo n't have that equal to symbol we don'twant X to be equal to negative 2so when I had that dot I 'm going to usean open circle there and here 's ourparabola nice and smooth alright thelast piece here 6 y equals 6 now ifyou 've seen some of my other videos ormaybe your teachers mentioned it or I'vedefinitely mentioned it in class if yousee y equal to a number I want you tothink of hoy H stands for horizontalwe 're going to have a horizontal linelet 's look and see where y equal 6 1 2 34 5 6 on our y-axis Y is equal to 6there but Y is also equal to 6 here andhere and here and here and here all theway across we can also go this way butactually I 'm about to erase some ofthese lines the reason why or erase someof these dots and the reason why I'mgoing to erase some of them is becausewe only want this line when X is biggerthan 3 so let 's get our line and when wedraw a line all right there it 's goingto change that color so it looks andmatches nicelyand notice this line that we have herelook at all these x-values well we don'tneed these this just helped us graph theline but now look at all these X valuesthat X value right there is one twothree now do we want X to be equal tothree I do n't see it equal to symbol sotherefore you want to emphasize thatfirst dot right there right here where Xis one two three you want to use an opencircle for this line because we wo n't Xto be strictly greater than three notequal to it so we have an open circleand you can leave these dots up here ifyou like or if you just remember to drawa horizontal line BAM just draw ahorizontal line notice all these Xvalues like right here that X valuelet 's drop it on down where we add onetwo three four five six that 's aboutwhere we were I 'm guessing but all theseX values here this is three this Xvalues four five six seven eight nineten and it goes on forever all those Xvalues are bigger than 3 and the Y valueon all those dots are on that line allthose Y values are equal to 6 butthere 's your piecewise function soremember to use closed circles when youhave the equal to symbols and use opencircles when you do n't have the equal tosymbols it never hurts to use a t-chartyou could even use a t-chart for linesif you forget how to graph lines but Ithought it would be a good idea toreview the y equals MX plus B thing hereand there you have it an example of apiecewise function and that is it forthis video hope it helped How to Graph a Piecewise Function How to Graph a Piecewise Function
