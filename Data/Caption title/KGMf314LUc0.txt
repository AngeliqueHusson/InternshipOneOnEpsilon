Hi and welcome to Math Antics . In this video lesson , weâ€™re gon na learn the basics of division . And if you really understand these basics , then itâ€™ll make it much easier learning how to do â€˜long divisionâ€™ which is the subject of our next video . Okay , so hereâ€™s how basic division works . You get a problem like this one : 9 divided by 3 , which means you have a total of 9 and you want to divide it into 3 equal groups . And if you can remember that 9 is an answer to one of the multiplication facts , or that itâ€™s an answer on the multiplication table , then you can see that since 3 Ã— 3 is 9 , then 9 divided by 3 is 3 . Itâ€™s that simple ! Wellâ€¦ at least it WAS that simple when you learned about the fact families . Now itâ€™s gon na get a little bit tricky because most division problems arenâ€™t quite this easy , like this one : 9 divided by 4 The trouble here is that 9 and 4 arenâ€™t part of a fact family , so you canâ€™t just find the answer on the multiplication table . Thatâ€™s because 9 is not a multiple of 4 . Thereâ€™s no whole number that you can multiply 4 by and end up with 9 . That means that 9 canâ€™t be divided equally into 4 groups without having something left over . Like if you had 9 cookies and 4 kids , each kid could have 2 cookies but there would be 1 left over . And in division , that left over amount is called a â€œremainderâ€ . So the answer to 9 divided by 4 is 2 with a remainder of 1 . Alright , so itâ€™s not that hard to figure out a simple division problem when you have a picture like this , but what about when we just have numbers . To do that , we use a special division procedure . Up until now , you probably have used this division symbol the most . It works well for very simple division problems , like the ones in our fact families . But , now that weâ€™re gon na be doing some harder problems , we need a new division symbolâ€¦ this oneâ€¦ This division symbol is special , because itâ€™s almost like a stage that will help us solve our division problem . And thereâ€™s three special areas of this stage where the three main parts ( or characters ) of our division problem will go . The first area is here under the long horizontal line on our division symbol . This is the area where we put the number that we will be dividing up . The fancy math term for this is the â€œdividendâ€ . Most of the time , the biggest number will go here , because we usually start with a big amount and want to divide it into smaller groups . The second area is out in front of the curved part of the division symbol . This is the area where we put the number we will be dividing BY . The math term for that is the â€œdivisorâ€ . In other words , this number will tell us how many groups we will be dividing our big amount into . And the third area is up above the horizontal line . This is where our answer will go , once we figure out what the answer is . The answer to a division problem is called the â€œquotientâ€ . The answer tells us how many we will end up with in each group . So whenever you have a complicated division problem to do , the first step is to re-write your problem in this form . If you have 9 divided by 4 like this , you put the â€˜9â€™ down here ( thatâ€™s the number weâ€™re dividing UP ) and you put the â€˜4â€™ out here ( thatâ€™s the number weâ€™re dividing BY ) and youâ€™re ready to start the next step of the procedure . The next step is the most important step , because itâ€™s where you figure out the answer . And to figure out the answer ( which is how many youâ€™ll end up in each group after you divide ) , you have to ask yourself a really important question involving the other two numbers . The question is , â€œHow many â€˜4â€™s will it take to make 9 or almost 9 ? â€ And the key to answering this question is for the number to be â€œjust rightâ€ . Do you remember the story of Goldilocks and the Three Bears ? â€¦how one chair was too big , and one chair was too small , but the other chair was â€œjust rightâ€ . Well , itâ€™s the same way with our division problem . If I choose an answer thatâ€™s too big or too small , it will cause trouble for me . Hereâ€™s what I meanâ€¦ Letâ€™s say that I decide that I only need ONE â€˜4â€™ to make 9 . So , Iâ€™ll write a â€˜1â€™ up here in the spot for the answer . Well now , the next step in the procedure is to multiply that answer I put there ( the 1 ) by the number of groups out front here ( the 4 ) and I write the answer to that multiplication down below the number Iâ€™m dividing up ( the 9 ) . I do that so I can subtract that amount from the 9 to see how much Iâ€™m gon na have left over ; to see how big the remainder will be . And when I do that , I see that 9 minus 4 will give me 5 . Hmmmâ€¦ thatâ€™s a pretty big remainder . In fact , the remainder is bigger that the number I am dividing by , and thatâ€™s why this answer is trouble . If the remainder is bigger than the number you are dividing by , it means that you should have picked a bigger answer because each of the groups you are dividing up into could have gotten more than they did . Your answer was too small , and so the remainder was too big . Okay then , I guess Iâ€™d better come up with a better answer to the question : â€œHow many â€˜4â€™s will it take to make 9 or almost 9 ? â€ This time , I think Iâ€™ll pick 3 . So , I put a â€˜3â€™ in the answer space , and then I follow the next step of the procedure like I did before . I multiply the answer I chose ( 3 ) by the number of groups ( 4 ) and I write the answer of that multiplication problem ( 12 ) down below the number weâ€™re dividing up ( 9 ) . Now I can subtract that number to see what my remainder will beâ€¦ or can I ? This looks like trouble again ! The answer to my multiplication is bigger than the number weâ€™re dividing up , so I canâ€™t subtract it . The remainder would be less than ZERO ! And I canâ€™t have a remainder less than zero . That canâ€™t be right . Hereâ€™s the problemâ€¦ when you choose an answer thatâ€™s too big , itâ€™s like trying to give too many to each group and then you run out of things to give before the groups are equal . And if the groups arenâ€™t equal they get all upset , [ high speed ] and if they get all upset they start fighting , and if they start fighting they get in trouble and the teacher puts them in â€œtime outâ€ , and then they canâ€™t go to recessâ€¦ . Okay , so 1 was too small : it gave us too big of a remainder . And 3 is too big : there wouldnâ€™t be any remainder at all and the groups wouldnâ€™t be equal , which causes big problems ! So letâ€™s try 2 . If we say that TWO â€˜4â€™s will make 9 or almost 9 , our problem looks like this . 2 goes in the answer spot , and then we do our multiplication procedureâ€¦ We multiply that 2 by the 4 and we get 8 . Then we write the 8 below the 9 so we can subtract it and find our remainder . 9 âˆ ’ 8 = 1 , so that means our remainder is 1 . Now that sounds good ! Itâ€™s less than our number of groups . And you can see with our cookie problem that itâ€™s exactly right . 9 cookies divider into 4 groups gives 2 cookies to each group with 1 left over as the remainder , which we put right up here in the answer with an â€˜râ€˜ for remainder . Perfect ! And now you can see how you can do division without using pictures ( or cookies ) but just with numbers and a procedure to follow . Letâ€™s try a couple more so you really see how it works . Letâ€™s try 23 divided by 5 . We start , as always , by making sure our problem is written correctly using our new division symbol . The 23 is what weâ€™ll be dividing up ( itâ€™s our dividend ) , so we put it under the line , and the 5 is what we are dividing by ( our divisor ) , so it goes out front . Ok , so now we ask , â€œHow many fives will it take to make 23 or almost 23 ? â€ Well , ONE â€˜5â€™ would be way to small , TWO â€˜5â€™s is 10 , ( thatâ€™s also too small ) THREE â€˜5â€™s would be 15 , FOUR â€˜5â€™s is 20 ( Ohh , that sounds promising ) now FIVE â€˜5â€™s is 25 ( and that would be too much ) So , it sounds like 4 is a really good number to pick for our answer , so let 's put that on the answer line . Next , we need to do the step where we multiply the answer ( 4 ) by the number of groups ( 5 ) and we get 20 which weâ€™ll write below the number weâ€™re dividing up ( 23 ) . Now we subtract those numbers to see what our remainder is : 23 minus 20 is 3 . Well thatâ€™s good . 3 is less than our number of groups , so itâ€™s a reasonable remainder . So our answer to 23 divided by 5 is 4 with a remainder of 3 . Letâ€™s do one more before you try working some out on your own , okay ? Letâ€™s do 57 divided by 6 . First we set up out problem and then we ask the question , â€œHow many â€˜6â€™s do we need to make 57 or almost 57 ? â€ Well this oneâ€™s a little more tricky , so I think I might use a multiplication table to help me out . The nice thing about a multiplication table is that it shows me all the multiples of a number . For example , since I want to know how many â€˜6â€™s I need , I can look on this row of the chart and see all the multiples of 6 . Here they are : 6 , 12 , 18 , 24 , 30 , 36 , 42 , 48 , 54 , and 60 . We need the multiple thatâ€™s 57 or almost 57 . And since 57 is not on the list , it looks like 54 is the next closest thing without being to big ( like 60 ) . And to get 54 , we need to have NINE â€˜6â€™s , so we will choose 9 as our answer . Next , we multiply 9 by 6 , which we already know will give us 54 because thatâ€™s what our multiplication table showed us . Now we need to subtract 54 from 57 . That gives us a remainder of 3 . Again , thatâ€™s good because thatâ€™s less than our divisor . So , 57 divided by 6 equals 9 with a remainder of 3 . Alright , thatâ€™s all for this lesson . And if youâ€™re new to division , thatâ€™s plenty to get you started . Itâ€™s really important to master these basic division problems that just involve one step that leaves you with a remainder . In the next video , weâ€™re gon na learn how to take this basic procedure weâ€™ve learned and repeat it multiple times in a process called â€œlong divisionâ€ . But before you move on , make sure you really practice what youâ€™ve learned in this video first . Good luck and Iâ€™ll see ya next time .
