So you 're me , and you 're in math class.And your teacher 's ranting on and onabout this article about whetheralgebra should be taught in school 每as if he does n't realize that what he 's teachingis n't even algebra 每which could have been interesting 每but how to manipulate symbolsand some special cases of elementary algebra 每which isn't.And so , instead of learning aboutself-consistent systems and logical thought , you spent all week memorizinghow to graph parabolas.News flash : No one cares about parabolas.Which is why half the class isplaying Angry Birds under their desks.But , since you do n't have a smart phone yet , you have to resort to a more nobleand outdated form of boredom relief 每that is , doodling.And you 've invented a game of your own.A doodle game that connects the dotsin ways your math curriculum never will 每except instead of connecting to the closest dotsto discover the mysterious hidden pictureyou 've got this precise method of skipping oversome number of dots and connecting them that way.In the past you 've characterized how this worksif your dots are arranged in a circle 每 say 11 dots 每and connect one to the dot four dots over , you get these awesome stars.And you can either draw the linesin the order of the dots , or you can just keep going around andmaybe it will hit all the dots , or maybe it wo n't , depending on how many dots are in your circle , and how many dots you skip.But then there are other shapes.Circles are good friends with sine waves.And sine waves are good friends with square waves.And let 's admit it , that 's pretty cool looking.In fact , just two simple straight lines of dotsconnecting the dots from one line to the otherin order somehow gives youthis awesome woven curve shape.Another student is asking the teacher when he 's evergoing to need to know how to graph a parabola 每even as he hides his multi-million dollar enterpriseof a parabola graphing game under his desk.If your teacher thought about it , he would probably think shooting birds at thingsis a great reason to learn about parabolasbecause he 's come to understand thateducation is about money and prestige andnot about becoming a better human able to do great things.You yourself have n't done anything really great yetbut you figure the path to your future greatnesslies more in inventing awesome new connect-the-dot arrangementsthan in graphing parabolas or shooting birds at things.And that 's when you begin to worry.What if this cool liney curvey thing you drewapproximates a parabola ? As if your teacher does n't realizeeveryone has their phones under their desks , but he 's underpaid and overworked andhis whole word runs on plausible deniability , so he shouts state-mandated , pass the test , teach-to-the-middle nonsense at studentswho are not at all fooledby his false enthusiasm or false mathematics andhe pretends he 's teaching algebra andthe students pretend to be taught algebra andeveryone else involved in the systemis too invested to do anythingbut pretend to believe them both.You think maybe it 's a hyperbola , which is similar to the parabolain that they are both conic sections.A hyperbola is a nice vertical slice of cone , the cone itself being just like a line swirled around in a circle , which is why the cone is like two cones radiating both ways ; the lovely hyperbola insecting both parts.Two perfect curves , looking disconnected when seen alonebut sharing their common conic heritage.While the boring old parabola is a slice taken at an anglecompletely meant to miss the top part of the cone andto miss wrapping around the bottom like an ellipse would.And it 's such a special , specific case of conic sectionthat all parabolas are exactly the same , just bigger or smaller or moved around.Your teacher could just as well hand you parabolas already drawnand have you draw coordinate grids on parabolasrather than parabolas on coordinate grids.And it 's stupid , and you hate it , and you do n't wan na learn to graph them , even if it means not making a billion dollarsfrom a game about shooting birds at things.Meanwhile anyone who actually learns how to think mathematicallycan then learn to graph a parabola or anything elsethey need in like five minutes.But teaching how to think is an individualized processthat gives power and responsibility to individualswhile teaching what to think can be donewith one-size-fits-all bullet points and check-boxesand our culture of excuses demands that we do the latter , keeping ourselves placated in the comforting structureof tautology and clear expectations.Algebra has become a check-box subject andmathematics weeps alone in the top of the ivory tower prisonto which she has been condemned.But you 're not interested in check-boxes ; you 're interested in dots , and lines that connect them.Or maybe you could connect them with semicircles , to give visual structure to lines that would otherwise overlap.Or you could say one dot is the center of a circle andanother defines a radius and draw the entire circleand do things that way.You could make rules about how every dotis the center of a circle with its neighbor being the radius , or say one dot stays the center of all circles , and all of the others define radii.But then you just get concentric circles , which I suppose should have been obvious.But what if you did it the other way around andsaid one dot always stays on the circle andall the other dots are centers , like this.Looks more promising.So you try putting all the dots in a circle andusing them as circle centers andchoose just one dot for the circles to go through andyou get this awesome shape that looks kind of like a heart.So let 's call it , oh I do n't know , a cardioid.Which happens to be the same curve that you getwhen parallel lines like rays of light reflect off a circlethe same heart of sunshine in a cup.Or maybe instead of circle centersyou could have points all on the curve of a circle , which means you need three points to define a circle , maybe just a point and its two closest neighbors to start with.And of course , any collection of circles is two-colorable , which means you can contrast light and dark colorsfor a classy color scheme.Or maybe you could throw down some random pointsto make all possible circles.Only that would be a lot of circles , so you choose just ones you like.And then , against your will , you begin to wonderhow many points it takes to define the boring old parabola.Because parabolas are actually a lot like circles in thatboth are like extreme ellipses , because a circle is like taking one focus of an ellipseand putting the other focus zero distance away.And a parabola is like an ellipse whereone focus is infinity distance away.Which is why everyone lies to you and saysthrowing balls or shooting birds is all about parabolaswhen really it 's about ellipsesbecause the earth is a sphere andgravity does n't actually go straight down.And the other focus of the elliptical orbit ofyour thrown object of choice may be very far away , but very far away is a great bit closer than infinity.So let 's not fool ourselves.You ca n't look at everything that seems kind of parabolicand call it a parabola.Sure , if you connect two dots with a hanging string or chain , it looks parabolic , and so do structurally strong arches , but they 're actually catenary arches andmaybe you ca n't tell by sight , but if you 're an architect you 'd better know the difference.Though caternarys are quite related to parabolas , you get them by rolling around a parabolaand tracing the focuswhich makes them a cousin of the ellipse andeven a hyperbola is like an ellipse that got turned inside outor whose focus went through infinity andcame out the other side or something.And of course parabolas and hyperbolas and ellipsesare all conic sections which meanthey all come from a line that got spun around.And a line is just what happenswhen a couple dots get connected.Or maybe what happens when your circle is so big that , like the extreme ellipse that becomes a parabola , the extreme circle is broken at infinity andbecomes a line before getting larger than infinitely bigwhich brings it back to the other side.This linear circle , the infinite in-between.Or maybe a line is what happenswhen you roll around a circle and trace the focus.Or rather the 2 foci , which are zero distance apart , in ellipse terms.Which makes you wonder what you getwhen you roll around an ellipse and trace the foci.In fact , there 's lots of great shapesyou can get by rolling around shapes on other shapes , like if you roll a circle around a circle and trace the focus , you get just another circle.But , if you trace a point on the edge , you get our awesome friend the cardioid again.So now it 's related to circles in three ways , which means it 's a close cousin of the ellipseand a second cousin to the infinite ellipse or , parabola.Except , not just that , if you take a parabola andinvert it around the unit circle , reversing inside and outside , one half becomes two , one hundred becomes a hundredth , one stays one , infinity becomes zero , you get once again , the cardioid.The cardioid is the anti-parabola which is goodbecause parabolas make you sad but you heart cardioids.And of course , any time you want toconnect two dots on a piece of paper , instead of drawing the line you could fold the line.Here 's the thing about connecting dots.You can have all the steps laid out for you , taking whatever next step is easiest and closestand be sure of what you 're getting the whole time.This way is safe and comfortable.Or , you can try new ways of connecting dotsand not know what you 're going to get.Maybe it will be something great , maybe it will fail.And when it fails it will be your fault.You ca n't blame anyone else , not mathematicsor the system or the check-boxes.But if I am to have faults I would rather they be my own . test
