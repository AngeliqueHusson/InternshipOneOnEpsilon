welcome in the brownie palwal video aquestion arose and perhaps quite atricky question we notice thatrectangles have the property thatthere 's a special point they need thecenter the rectangle with the diagonalsmeet such that any line straight linethrough that point is guaranteed to chopthe rectangles in two parts of equalarea so the question arose arerectangles the only shape with thatproperty well the answer is No rectparallelograms have that propertyregular octagons have that property sothe dips out there so the question iscan we classify them and figure out whatcommon feature they all have so thequestion is again just to be very clearsuppose we have a polygon with theproperty that there exists a specialpoint P someone 's interior such that anystraight line through that point isguaranteed to chop the polygon do partsof equal area no matter which line aredrawn what can we say about that polygonmust be a regular some kind must have aneven number sides an odd number sidescan we say what can we say about sideswhat property must it possess so that'sthe research question and I 'm in a goodway they ask this video is going to takea little bit of work it 's going to takesome doing I 'm going to realize themsome serious math and geometry but I'mgoing to answer this question in aboutthree seconds and give away all theanswer see if you want to pause and playfor this for yourself now 's the time todo that all right here goes um thisyellow polygon I 've drawn here I I canjust tell by looking at it it 's notgonna do the trick because I claimed theproblem with this guy is is that yesthere 's certainly a line that goesthrough the point P and it hits twosides in fact i 'll call these oppositesides the size of the hit or call themopposite so this line hits the side andhits this side i claim that if thispolygon has the property that any linethrough p chops into parts of equal areathen this line better be parallel tothat line does not this picture moreoverthis line better be the same length thisline the very congruent or congruent inamerica so I claim the only polygonsthat have this property of the ones thathave opposite sides beinggrunt and parallel namely likerectangles and squares andparallelograms themselves and regulareven gonz a regular octagon a regularhexagon a regular pentagon wo n't do itbetter do n't even have a clear oppositesides all right how do we prove this soI 'm going to prove that if a polygon hasthe property that has this area choppingproperty it must have opposite sidesCongress and parallel so let me just geta picture going I 'll draw two sides ofthe polygon and I 've drawn them parallelnot assuming it just yet and the polygonkeeps going on the left and the polygonkeeps going on the right if this polygondoes indeed have a special point P thesome point P and the interior we'regoing to use that fact that chops theair into two parts of equal to thepolygons two parts of equal area sohere 's a line through P and we 're toldthe left area whoops let 's meet up n isequal to the right area all right that'sgoing to be true for any point through Pany line through peace let me drawanother one make you a thin line therewe go so the area to the left of thisthin line equals the air is left is thatto the right of that thin line well alittle bit of thought then shows forthese two lines the area of thistriangle here is all paint yellow mustequal the area of that triangle thereknowing that those are equal area I betthat 's enough to prove that the topbottom edges the opposite edges of thisline must be parallel and here goes I'mgonna do it in a very strange way andit 's going to take a little bit of workso the first let me get a pen going allright first of all notice that byvertical angles those two angles areequal and if this is side a and thatside B and the slightest let 's see inthe side length D I can actually write aformula for these areas the area of atriangle is half the product was twosides times the sine of the anglebetween them all right so there'sadvanced math right there the area ofthat yellow triangle is half for the topone a B sine of the angle dot and thearea this bottom triangle is a half CDsign of the same angle dot that the samearea so right now know that a times B isthe same as C times D or if you 're likethe ratio of our B to C is the same asthe ratio d to a all right that 's thelittle feature I want to use right nowunfortunately that 's not quite helpfulas it stands i 'm gon na do is something alittle weird and draw yet another linegoing through p here it goes whoops makesure touches by the same token the areaof this pink triangle with the area thatsame as the air is that triangle in factthe area of the whole pink and yellow onthe top it 's the air they 'll fingernailon the bottom but the fact that any linecuts the whole area of the polygon inhalf let me label the its edges to dolet 's call it ABC what we up to e whoopsneed a pen sorry E and F and right atthe same trick with the triangle e thisangle and a and D and this angle and F Ican bet I could prove that e to F isalso d2a in particular b2c and easily Fand the same ratio namely this triangleand this triangle have sides coming inthe same ratio and by vertical anglesthey 're the same angle the top so by theSAS principle and geometry I 've nowproven those two pink triangles areactually similar and in fact now improvethe two yellow triangles are similar inthe whole picture on a summer pet Allahwe I 've now proved they 're basicallysimilar triangles everywhere that I wantto think about it in this picture greatnow similar triangles was that mean itmeans angles match in particular maybeyou want to go this angle here matchesthis angle here that is I 've now got oneline another line and so now can thinkof the transversal with a property thatone angleangles across the transversal there'salternate interior angles are congruentthat means the opposite sides must infact be parallel alright so for polygonhas this property that 's a sexist aspecial point P any line through thatperiods opposite sides must be hittingparallel lines those opposite sides mustbe parallel all right just as a littlepoint that means we ca n't actually havea kink going on that I kind of a linethrough peer that then changes hit hitsthis other side instead because if I hadthat going all by the same token we justproved this side must be parallel tothat side as well well you ca n't have abent line that 's parallel in parallel sobasically these lines have to always hitand not go around a corner so there'sreally is some sense true opposite edgeslet me go a little bit further mypicture is awfully messy and maybe whatI 'm doing does n't quite make sense whenwe get going here goes we 've just proventhat the pink triangles at the same areaat a similar now this area scales is thekiss scale factor squared so these totry on was a similar with scale factor kthen area changes is k squared but theseare the same area so the area betweenthese two pink triangles is the samewhich tells me that the scale factorbetween them k squared is 1 which meansk is one that actually these two pinktriangles are not just similar thatCongress their scale factor 1 so theyhave scale factor one we have now proventhat the point P is actually at themidpoint of any line going through it ohmy gosh mess mess mess let 's draw thehis pair of opposite sides which we haveproven a parallel here 's my specialpoint P we have now proven that any linepair of lines going through them dessertmust give parallel linesand we 've proven these two trying was asimilar scale factor 1 which means thatactually this length equals this lengthand this length equals this length sothis point Spears are actually goingthrough the midpoint so now I think I'vecompletely gotten it that we 've nowproven that the line through peer thatgoes through here must still stay onthis line vice versa the line at thisend goes through P must end they'lleither kakaka around a corner 0 this wayeverything 's going through midpointsthese triangles are congruent thislength is equal to this length so for apolygon to the property that exists apoint P such as any line through it cutsinto two parts of equal area must havethe property that there are well definedopposite sides that are parallel andcongruent ah there 's a little bit ofwork we should do the converse suppose Igive you a shape with opposite sides ofthe conquered in parallel you do need toprove it has the special property andit 's actually not too hard to prove itand let me just give a quick idea sohere 's a shape so if these are congruentand parallel then I claim there 's aspecial point P that works and how tofind that point is connect these linesdeserted it to do i claim with thoseloans a sec that 's your special point Pand I bet you can go off you go andprove that everything is working rightnow all right now here 's an interestingquestion I 've stuck with polygons if apolygon is the property that it cuts hasthis Gary Cadogan half property than amust-have upsized con with and parallelbut what about curved sides for exampleoops we know that circles have thisproperty that 's not very good circle medraw a good circle little droolthere is a certainly special point Pthat any any line through the center ofthe circle cut it into two parts ofequal area in fact you can get quitefunky circles not need not be the onlyshape what if I pulled my circle apartand drew this line and this line I claimthis shape too has the property of thiscutting in half property which makes mewonder here 's a real research questioncan you just tell me the whole class ofshapes with curved edges of style thathave this area cutting in half propertywe get this weird over Lloyd things theywork other other things with circularsections sort of straight edge edges forboundary point boundary edges how aboutnon circular parts does the curvaturehave to be constant pull out thisproperty now we 're trying out researchso the question is not just polygonscutting any shape in half what 's theultimate answer to this ultimatequestion now in real research territoryhave fun test
