JAMES GRIME : OK , so , the superflip -- so let me write down the superflip for you.Rubik 's cube fans have a notation , and they call thisthe up , they call this the down , they call this theright-hand side -- for obvious reasons -- the left-hand side , the front , which is facing me -- and the back , which is facing away from me there.So it 's got up , down , left , right , front , and back.I can write down the superflip using this idea.It 's going to take 20 moves.I 'm going to write down what the 20 moves are , then we'lltry it out.Looks like this -- up.So I 'm going to turn the up once.Now , this means right-hand side twice -- once , twice.Front -- that 's towards me -- once.Back -- that 's over here.That 's the back -- right.Right-hand side again.Back twice.Look at it there.Oh , one , two that one too.Right.Up twice -- one , two.Left -- back twice -- one , two.Right -- '' U '' dash -- that means the opposite direction -- anticlockwise.Down -- anticlockwise.Right-hand side twice.Front.Right-hand side backwards.Left.Bottom twice -- once , twice.Up twice -- once , twice.And then do the front twice , so once , twice.Look at that.So there are 20 moves there , and this wassuperflip , the cube.From the solved state , you get this really pretty combinationthere , and this is the furthest away from beingsolved that you can get.Now , if you look at it , what's happened is all the cornersare perfectly fine.You see , this is the orange face.All the orange corners and the center are just fine.This is the orange face.Look at the edge pieces.This is the orange-white edge , and it 's flipped over.Turn it 'round.This is the orange-blue edge , and it 's flipped over.This is the orange-yellow edge , which is flipped over.And that 's the orange-green edge , and that 's flipped over.So all the edge pieces flip over.All the corners are absolutely fine , and the centers arealways fine.They do n't move at all.There 's a couple of cool things about this superflipthat I have n't told you yet.So if I do the superflip twice -- so the superflip was 20 moves.If I do it twice , I will get back to where I started.In mathematics , we say it has order 2.You do it twice , and you 'll get back to where you started.So that 's pretty cool.The other cool thing about the superflip is that if I do abunch of moves , and then I do the superflip , you 'll get thesame answer as if you do the superflip first , and then youdo that bunch of moves.So you 'll get the same answer.So if you do superflip first , and stuff , or if you do stufffirst , and superflip , you 'll get the exact same position.In fact , superflip is the only move that is n't just doingnothing at all.It 's the only move that has that property.MALE SPEAKER : Because I would have thought that would betrue for everything , but it 's not.JAMES GRIME : It 's not true for everything.Now , that 's really important.So if I do a move followed by anothermove , the order matters.The order matters.You get a different answer if you do it in a differentorder , if you swap those over , except for the superflip.Only the superflip -- this works.The order does n't matter.MALE SPEAKER : Oh , whoa -- lock up.No ! Wha -- oh , man . test
