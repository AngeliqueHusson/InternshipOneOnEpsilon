last video one digit forever able convert fraction sin video want tackle something little bit interesting multiple let say thing point since bar repeat keep going like forever key type problem like last video set equal x instead multiplying shift one want shift enough line decimal part still line want actually shift decimal space two right shift two right second power going equal shifting two right one two going equal decimal going going forever let rewrite x going subtract equal forever notice still line align decimal sand want make sure get decimal lined appropriately reason valuable subtract x part cancel let us subtract two left hand side minus x give us get right hand side part cancel left divide sides left x equal numerator denominator divisible reduce divide numerator get denominator get forever forever let another interesting say number thing notice going repeat going repeat let set equal x might temp ted multiply get decimal way clear actually dont want want shift enough pattern right subtraction situation even though three behind decimal point two want multiply second power want multiply get equal moving decimal two right one two going going let rewrite x right x equal notice theyre lined right going work subtract let subtract minus x going equal going cancel minus head borrow like could minus minus equal divide sides could see sudden something strange happening still decimal fix end let divide sides get x equal obviously havent converted pure fraction yet still decimal numerator thats pretty easy fix multiply numerator denominator get rid decimal let multiply numerator denominator get one example let say something like let write want convert fraction set equal x notice going going repeat since three want think third power times x let us shift right part cancel going equal going shift decimal three right one two three going point keep keep going forever going subtract x x x equal want make sure decimal lined dot dot dot keep going forever notice us line subtract part cancel let subtraction left hand side something minus something something part going cancel part going equal let see minus get equal divide sides left x equal obviously improper fraction numerator denominator could convert proper fraction like one way could tried figure forever equal whole number part mixed fraction could divide could pretty straightforwardly goes three times remainder well let go goes go three know originally going find remainder times add times left subtract regroup borrow however want call could could new color still smaller need regroup could could smaller right regroup would minus minus minus left right yep going equal done converting decimal fraction linear equation algebra khan academy converting decimal fraction linear equation algebra khan academy converting decimal fraction linear equation algebra khan academy converting decimal fraction linear equation algebra khan academy converting decimal fraction linear equation algebra khan academy converting decimal fraction linear equation algebra khan academy converting decimal fraction linear equation algebra khan academy converting decimal fraction linear equation algebra khan academy converting decimal fraction linear equation algebra khan academy converting decimal fraction linear equation algebra khan academy converting decimal fraction linear equation algebra khan academy converting decimal fraction linear equation algebra khan academy converting decimal fraction linear equation algebra khan academy
