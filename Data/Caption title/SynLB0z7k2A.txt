g'day here 's an age-old questionconsider the number zero point nine ninenine nine nine nine nine going onforever does that equal one or is thatnot equal one no no ten one machinewould be okay here 's the timer machinenothing point nine dots nine dots 9.29.2 9.4 machine at least in the decimalpart of the machine so is that numberone or is that number not one studentsof all ages are festooned by thisquestion as am i all right so how do wethink about this first of all I need tonote that we cheat meaning we neveractually write down the number we'retalking about I wrote down line it waslike 1012 nines and not to go to dot dotdot and ellipses to say keep going I isa human being ca n't actually write downthe number I 'm talking aboutI ca n't keep going I ca n't keep writingan infant number of nines to the rightof the decimal place so right therethere 's a cheat going on so it 's a mindgame this is something that it seems toexist in our minds and we 're asking if Ireally could go beyond the end of timeand write down if number of 9s to theright of the decimal point is the resultof that particular thing equal to one ornot equal to one and it 's curious herebecause we human beings will never seeit equal to one example if I juststopped writing after three nine so Iget point nine nine nine oh that 's notonce more than one if I wrote the firstyou know seven nine point nine nine ninenine nine nine nine there 's still lessthan one whatever Isak human being canactually have the patience to write downwill never equal ones always be smallerthan one so that might make you think ohif what I always see is a human beinghorrid down 20 billion nines would stillbe shy of the number one I will neversee one as a human that makes me thinkmaybe but the whole number in the enditself is also less than one that 's afair enough argument but then if you donow to break argument example I'mwondering what this this particularnumber is let 's do some mathematics onit and a very standard algorithm goes asfollows first of all give it a name Iknow I 'll call it f for Frederica andwhat many people do to fredericka isthey multiply fredericka by 10 why whatdoes that do well I remember tearspoint nine nine nine every mobile by tenactually then becomes nine point ninenine nine nine nine nineBriella which will be of courseFrederika times ten tenRodriguez great so far so good now gonnasubtract these two results so I want meto do is say nine point nine nine ninefour over ten free to recurs takeaway0.99 forever one Frederico must give methe equation nine with a whole bunch of9s takeaway zero with a whole bunch ofnine it 's all the nights after this onecancel 99.99 point no no no Bluebird isten free to recurs minus one Fredericothat is 93 cos ah that tells meFrederico must equal to 1 what wasfredericka it was the number we'retalking aboutapparently point nine nine nine ninenine for ever recorded in mathematicsequals one all right I believe that wellmaybe I do actually if I draw a numberline here 's a number line here 's 0here 's one it keeps goingwell I 'm really doing is I first got thenumber point nine okay if there 's nopoint nines about they 're not drawn toscale next want to be point nine nine Iguess is there 0.99 not drawn to scalenext one on this list would be pointnine nine nine which is they 're notdrawn to scale point nine nine nine ninewould be even closer maybe if I think ofthis way point nine point nine ninepoint nine nine nine the numbers I seeas a human being do seem to bescrunching up to the number one whichmight make you think okay it really doesequal 1 alright fair enoughmaybe another way to do it is actuallygoing back to the ten one machine isthere any way I can see this equals onewell what I could do perhaps is um whynot what I put a dot and an anti got inhere dot and e dot they 're stilltypically nine dots in that boxbut then this explosion kaboom messyfingers and dot so now I got one an Tdot nine nine nine nine nineI 'll put do it again here dot ten T dotKapow dot o dot auntie buh annihilationdo it again here dot and e dot dotoops it 's getting very smudgynope you follow so that 's empty auntiedot nine nine nine nine do it again dotand u dot cabal dot no relation buh ifas I keep doing it I can see all this isclearing away and it does seem to equalone okay so maybe we 've now argue thatpoint nein nein nein nein nein nein neinnein nein nein if I could do thisforever if I go beyond the end of timeactually write down that number thatnumber in the end will be equal to oneit seems totally believable this seemslike an ironclad argument here 's thething if you believe this argument thenyou 're gon na have to also believe whatI 'm going to do in the next video watchout test
