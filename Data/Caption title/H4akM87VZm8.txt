g'day welcome to take math channel whatwe 're going to be having a look at inthis video is a really fast cool littleway of working out the total interiorangles of any polygon so I 'm going tosay that in normal plain English now I'mtalking about what the total of theseangles inside this particular shape thisis a hexagon but any many-sided shapehow you could work that out so thiscould be a six-sided shape like thishexagon here or it can be an eight-sidedshape or it could be a 10 sided shape ora hundred sided shape and how you couldwork out what the total of the angles ofthe shape is okay and then from that youcould actually even see if they 're equalangles work out how big each angle is aswell so that 's fairly oh it 's a fairlygood little trick for doing that also soalthough it straight in to how I 'd workon this hexagon here so the way thisworks what we 're going to be having alook at with this is we 're gon na bebasically working with this idea whichis first off we 're going to have a lookat triangles in there you may or may notknow this with triangles first off atriangle has three angles one two threeand that these angles add up to 180degree so that this angle Plus thisangle on this angle 180 degrees doesn'tmatter on the triangle the angles alwaysadd up to 180 degreesso what we 're going to do is we 're goingto break our hexagon here up intotriangles so I 'm going to start from oneof the our corners here one of the airone of these points and we 're going tostart making triangles okay so I haveone triangle I have two triangles I havethree triangles and I have a fourththrowing layer one two three fourtriangles and so now it 's pretty simplewe do each of these triangles is 180degrees so four times 180 degrees and wewill have our answer okay so 4 times 180this is 720 degrees so the total ofthese angles within this hexagon is 720degrees okay so that 's pretty cool rightwhat about I 'll go to a different shapewhat about we have a look atoctagon which you probably all knowalready has how many sides that 's rightit 's eight sides so I would get you todraw out an octagonman that 's a bit bit ordinary thatbottom I 'll draw that again yeah okay Iget you to draw it out like to get getyou to try and do this as well so I'mgoing to practice this up into as manytrials as I can so we have one trianglehere two triangles three triangles fourtriangles five triangles and sixtriangles okay so we have one two threefour five six triangles okay so sixtimes 180 will give us the total of allof these angles okay so six times 180 is1080 degrees so that 's a pretty coollittle trick right and you might saywell does it work for different types ofshapes you might not have thought thatokay but I 'm going to ask that questionfor you an answer for you so say we hada Pentagon a Pentagon and I wasn'tdrawing it particularly nicely I wasdrawing it so it looked a bit like thisokay okay I guess it 's a one two threefour five sided shape okay maybe all ourjust change these a bit to accentuatethat a little bit more okay so you'llsee here we 've got a five sided shapenow it also works for the Pentagon thatlooks like this okay so here because Iwanted to do is break it up into thetriangles okay so I have one trianglehere I have two triangles and I havethree triangles we have one two threeokay so three times 180 degrees this isequal to 540 degrees okay so this anglethis angle this angle this angle andthis angle add up to 540 degrees so it'sa really really great little trick forthat and you might even have you 're veryvery good withalgebra or anything on this or formulasme I 'd almost put together a formula forthis I 'll give it to you view I want toknow by the way so pretty much theformula for this and if you haveformulas just bear with us cuz I 'm goingto show you one thing after this theformula for this the total of the anglesis equal to the number of the sides takeaway two times 180 so the number oftriangles that we get is always two lessthan the number of sides okay so it 's aeight sided shape the number Troma'swe 're going to get is C because if it'sa ten sided shape the number oftriangles we 're going to get from thatis going to be eight and we just timesthat by hundred eighty so that 's alittle formula you can use for this nowI 'm just going to show you just one lastlittle application for this well there'sother ones too but you know just justone for now and it 's this so say we hada I 'll go back to my hexagon okay so saywe have my hexagon and because I 've handdrawn it 's not going to be perfect butpretend it was perfect and pretend whatwe had is all these angles were the sameokay so it was one of these lovely sortsof hexagons like that now if that wasthe case we could also then work out thesize of these angles really reallysimply because well we have six sidesand you might remember you work that outwe can break that up into four trianglesand four times 180 is 720 degrees okaybut then what we could do is we couldsay okay so how big is each angle and wejust need to divide that by the numberangles there are there 's one two threefour five six so 720 divided by six andyou will see that each angle is 120degrees so that 's where you can justtake that a little bit further if youneed to know those particular anglesthere anyway I hope you enjoyed thatvideo it 's a really really great littletrick so you know use it okay anyway anycomments any suggestions any uhcriticisms hey let us know okay see youlater bye Angles of any shape instantly Angles of any shape instantly Angles of any shape instantly
