so welcome to part two of how to solvethe two by T rubik 's cube at this pointyou should have one side completelysolved and you should also have the toplayer completely solved as well and inthis video we are going to solve therest of the cube and throughout theduration of this video we 're going tokeep the opposite of the solved side ourself side is white we 're gon na keep theopposite side as the top side of thecube and the opposite side of white isyellow not all Rubik 's cubes are thesame but most of the time the oppositeside of white is yellow so we know thatthis side has to be the yellow side ofthe cube and we know that these twopieces are in their correct positionsand orientated the correct way so weknow that this side has to be blue sincethese two pieces are blue we know thatthis this side has to be red since thesetwo pieces are red so on and so forthalright so what we 're actually trying todo is actually get all of their piecesnot necessarily flipped the correct waybut in their correct positions so whatdoes this mean let 's take a look at thispiece right here this piece has to beblue on this side because you know thisside is blue so we know that this sidehas to be blue we know that this side ofthe piece has to be red since this isthe red side of the cube and we knowthat this side of the piece has to beyellow since the top side is the yellowside of the cube and let 's take a lookat the colors of this piece it is bluered and yellow so this piece is actuallythe correct piece that needs to go intothis position it 's just not flipped thecorrect way or orientated the correctway so what we 're going to do first isget all four pieces in their correctpositions just not necessarilyorientated the correct way and if you'rereally lucky all four pieces willalready be in their correct positionsbut most of the time that does nothappen um so let 's take a look at howmany pieces are in their correctposition all right we already know thatthis piece is in its correct positionall right let 's take a look at thispiece right here this piece needs to bered green and yellowand it is red green and yellow so wehave two pieces in their correctposition this piece is definitely notin its correct position because it hasblue and orange and this is green andorange so we have two pieces that are intheir correct positions and we have twopieces that are not in their correctpositions just trust me on this one bothboth of these are not in their correctpositions and that is bad all right whatwe want to do is we want to get just onepiece in its correct position so I'mgoing to rotate this top side so thatonly one piece is in its correctposition all right and at this point wedo only have one piece that is in thiscorrect position it 's actuallyorientated the correct way as well thispiece needs to be orange blue and yellowand it is orange blue and yellow so wehave one piece that it 's in this correctposition and now we have three piecesthat are not in their correct positionsokay and at this point what you want todo is you want to rotate these threepieces so that all four of these pieceson the yellow side of the cube are intheir correct positions and when you dothis algorithm which I 'm about to teachyou you want to keep the piece that isin its correct position in the bottomright corner of the cube all right sothe algorithm goes something like thisand goes top clockwise right away fromyoutop counterclockwise left away from youtop clockwise right towards you topcounterclockwise left towards you allright and let 's see how many pieces wehave in their correct position at thispoint we still have this only one piecein its correct position and these threepieces are still not in their correctpositions if this happens you just needto do this algorithm one more time onceagain we 're going to rotate these threepieces all right so the same algorithmtop clockwise right away from you topcounterclockwise left away from you topclockwise right towards you topcounterclockwise left towards you and Ijust got really lucky all four piecesare orientated the correct way so weactuallyall the cue by doing that that thisnormally does n't happen so I 'm going tojust scramble this cube up a little bitso that all four pieces are in theircorrect positions but not necessarilyorientated the correct way and solvedall right okay so at this point if youdid n't get really lucky like I didearlier you should have at least haveall four pieces in their correctpositions like I have right now allrightthis piece should be green orange andyellow green orange and yellow thispiece needs to be green red and yellowgreen red and yellow so all four ofthese pieces distrusting are in theircorrect position and whenever you havethis done you want to place the ifthere 's any piece that 's orientated thecorrect way like this piece is righthere you want to place that in thebottom left corner of the top side ofthe cube and at this point you need toperform a short algorithm that you thinkis actually going to mess up the cubebut just trust me that we 're actuallygoing to solve it when we do this allright so the algorithm is gon na gosomething like right counterclockwisedown side to the left right clockwisedown side back the other way and youwant to complete this algorithm untilthis piece is orientated the correct wayso we 're just gon na keep doing that youknow that same algorithm I 'm gon na goright down right down okay so now we wedid the algorithm again and now thispiece is orientated the correct way soat this point we can just rotate the topside so that the next piece that 's notorientated the correct way is in thisposition and we 're going to do the samealgorithm right down right down rightdown right down okay now this piece isorientated the correct way now we needto do it for our last piece that 's notsolved so I 'm gon na rotate this top sideso this piece that 's not solved there orinto the correct ways in this positionand the algorithm goes right down rightdown right down right down and at thispoint you should have the cubecompletely solvedjust need to rotate the top side 180degrees and congratulations we have justsolved the 2x2 Rubik 's Cube I hope youenjoyed this video and if you want totackle something a little bit moredifficult feel free to look at my 3x3tutorial so I hope you enjoyed thesevideos
