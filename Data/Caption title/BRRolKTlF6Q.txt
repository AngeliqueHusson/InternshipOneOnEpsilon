mat parker perfectly good number ignore peril problem dangerous number lot thing go horribly wrong slightly unusual nuance number little bit careful handle thing ca n ca n divide something ca n thing like power get ked time people constantly ca n divide want divide n infinity blah blah blah thought would two going show can not divide infinity bit complicated also going look ca n power grime k something lot may know something like multiplication really want times add plus plus plus times division subtraction want take number like oh divide keep subtract ing take away take away take away five number thats divided equal subtraction really divide mean subtract ing divided mean take away got take away still got take away would go one forever would never get far something like keep taking away divided infinity n surely surely infinity expect people think surely n erd would tell differently cut mat telling parker first everyone goes cant say something divided let say going function going function grime n say something equal infinity k infinity number ca n like number idea ca n say divided equal infinity say say divided equal blue naughty divided equal infinity would get equally divided equal infinity obviously get problem one seem equal see thats nonsense n good reason n say equal infinity going get nonsense like equal parker take limit take limit x close n equal infinity would say actually dividing could therefore conclude equal infinity going show ca n imagine number line number going put right middle might way go along going draw axis going going would come back let say going bit bigger going twice big time get going come get closer closer absolutely agree get bigger bigger goes racing tend infinity absolutely correct works approaching positive coming right number come left completely different start negative value actually go negative negative get closer closer value goes racing direction fact goes racing negative infinity yes approach one direction get infinity come different way exactly place get well ca n get much different negative infinity people yell say infinitely different positive infinity blah blah maybe line goes way around wrap around entire universe comes back far concerned coming one direction get one answer coming direction get different answer going one limit get closer closer dividing one limit completely different answer sand say undefined mathematically would say say want blue time sorry approach limit x approach es positive direction equal positive infinity separately limit negative direction infinity different equal different simply assume equal grime go direction going plus infinity go direction goes infinity two different ha ran type divided calculator computer ca n ca n handle trying though happen circuit try fail calculator taught mat parker oh thats good question something getting answer rote taught divide honestly n know suspect taught someone say error might actually try get answer iterative process one got kind built cap kind safety switch goes say calculation getting control call say math error imagine might even vary device device one two thing people get got power reason get got anything anything power always say equal got power anything always say equal happen collide people honest argue different ways depending need often people argue equal experience although video people comment argue course equally insane going show ca n absolutely lovely start number line normal number line middle time look limit x approach es time function x power x right going slide fact come positive direction know come limit negative direction x x see get obviously theyre different thing going horribly wrong draw axis going graph ing x x get closer honest path follow irrelevant happen come one side hit come side hit fact exactly answer give one say well n matter side coming come along number line way middle come along line way middle case function limit surely call slightly complicated real number going go real number line boring go backwards forwards also got complex number sand need put imaginary going put imaginary axis got entire surface number sand got real one direction imaginary single point part complex plane fact load different ways come towards origin could approach anywhere complex plane approach es get different n get start fall apart go complex plane even though surface might look like limit n work go complex number sand mathematician still get emotional try say value fact still undefined grime something like x divided going draw x think x divided brad ha ran slide page around bit jam es grime think x divided going fine except cal led origin point equal equal point something divided n sound like good news infinity fact answer want depending angle come show mean line equal x travel along line thing x say equal x actually x divided x line would k traveling along would quite happy say well everything else going say yeah cal led removable singularity proper name travel along direction line minus equal minus case get x divided equal minus x minus line minus let try going travel along word equal x axis equal get x divided said equal x divided dear well know problem going something like going naughty going infinity plus infinity minus infinity something like go along direction axis thing right x equal going say equal divided line equal would say well point problem take call depend angle approach fact make number made minus plus infinity depending angle come make number want divided property cal led undefined frankly could make anything want depending angle come interposing voice mat parker angle sort problem zero problem zero problem zero problem zero problem zero problem zero problem zero problem zero problem zero problem zero problem
