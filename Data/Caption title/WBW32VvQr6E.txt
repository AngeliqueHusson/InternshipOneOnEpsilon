welcome let briefly talk famous problem mathematics cal led basal problem u h first pose mathematician ben gali sum sequela enough mathematics spelt able say actually final answer know number actually um later came known particular example function know zeta general decay reciprocal decay basic min gali whats value theta well took year find way actually compute particular sum away thats actually completely inspired completely brilliant know math would stay actually proved everything great technical detail know need take away brilliance let go order ill avoid technical detail show brilliance hand go slightly circa tourist route let ask different ked polynomial would point would two value polymer actually equal x equal b c trouble beast probably obvious thing get x minus x minus b x minus c x minus great advantage unfortunately every put zero formula get one rectify dividing numerator would result example problem ever trick let simplify little bit x minus divided could x minus one x b minus one x c minus one x minus one going going one little step multiply everything negative one going even number term correct reason clear leading coefficient one expand product cost term would choosing constant set parentheses one five could follow latter formula well trick constant term one clue x equal ax would c x equal e alright go theres general technique finding polynomial must x p going take apply technique sort infinite degree infinite series thats questionable part know blithely going along let particular polynomial thought work sine x whoops pen know infant agree upon analysis x must execute three factorial plus x five five factorial right grand nose know sine x zero zero plus minus pi plus minus pi plus minus three pipe trouble particular polynomial put zero doesnt equal one thought divide sides x book polynomial said one minus x squared three factorial plus x fourth five factorial polynomial clearly put one least right hand side x equal zero right hand side pop value one guy well removed zero guy book must polynomial form minus x pi minus x negative pi minus x pi go turn one last x pi dot dot forever first two term really minus x pi times plus x pi difference two square minus x squared pi squared next two term sare going trick minus x squared pi squared next turn right x minus pi squared x x must whole thing said since willing believe pop solution puzzle problem look let actually expand infinite product right gon na leave stuff dont need right expand right hand side ill green pen expand constant n choosing every term one theyll stuck x squared sand ill work minus x get x squared term choose x squared term one set parentheses one theyre hardly drew choosing first parentheses showcase minus pi squared pi squared could choose x squared term parentheses one everywhere else give plus pi squared size take could choose x squared negative x square pi squared pi squared actually expand product right know must extra squared term coefficient keep going wish know coefficient x squared must right look must negative term must well got pi squared way multiply sides pi squared plus plus must pi squared value zeta clever actually formula sofar cant taken little wall actually came interesting formula pi infinite continued fraction correctly actually got right well let take formula sine x x equal infinite product choose specific value x let work pi well sine degree sis left hand side pi going infinite product well gon na one put x equal pi pi squared cancel minus pi squared pi pi square cancel minus minus times still swift fraction minus minus actually pi given product us actually express saying instead pi times times times times times times times theres formula clever indeed right well weak weight coefficient x squared product theres interesting former come coefficient x fourth patient expand term whats hidden wonderful little mystery thanks problem value zeta two wall product tan ton mathematics problem value zeta two wall product tan ton mathematics problem value zeta two wall product tan ton mathematics problem value zeta two wall product tan ton mathematics problem value zeta two wall product tan ton mathematics problem value zeta two wall product tan ton mathematics problem value zeta two wall product tan ton mathematics problem value zeta two wall product tan ton mathematics problem value zeta two wall product tan ton mathematics problem value zeta two wall product tan ton mathematics problem value zeta two wall product tan ton mathematics problem value zeta two wall product tan ton mathematics problem value zeta two wall product tan ton mathematics problem value zeta two wall product tan ton mathematics problem value zeta two wall product tan ton mathematics problem value zeta two wall product tan ton mathematics problem value zeta two wall product tan ton mathematics
