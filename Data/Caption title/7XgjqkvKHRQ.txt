g day welcome take math channel going look video way working highest common factor given say number goes two ill give really really accurate way ill give example going try find ill give find common factor highest common factor biggest number goes give times hopefully highest common factor common factor excellent work going show work might even might want still method anyway get common factor quickly ill show following look atour two basically going choose one going divide one eight goes times times remainder thats remainder going worried next step going move remainder next step moving onto next step part next step divided another case original two going onto next another step another step would choose say two step many times go hey goes three times comes three times remainder code goes perfectly remainder stop know common factor number divided smaller two get pretty much method interview dividing smaller number number two two trying find common factor going removing remainder onto next stage aswell one previous step going continue get remainder get remainder number weve divided one two common factor highest common factor look couple example give example one probably going ill look straight away working may look straight away go hey k highest common factor thats great going use show method anyway going goes one time goes one time remainder remainder going put going take two going use next part look many times go goes five times remainder highest common factor yeah get method ah well go another one ill give one ill go rone together ill give couple looking many times come goes three goes three times remainder going move remainder going move smaller two look many times four goes goes twelve goes times remainder highest ill give go remain interested old method method fairly old try might want pause video hopefully youve done hopefully youve given going see many times seventy eight goes many times going goes remainder put going move smaller two see many times goes goes yeah goes remainder going move move remote move smaller leaves many times go goes two times remainder highest common factor one last happy example look work really really big excellent probably best method obviously small use multiplication knowledge get fairly far bigger really really great method give one really big number well really big big going look already five goes would highest common factor two start many times goes goes five times see tha tokay five times going theres remainder put move hundred five good yeah many times theres goes p two times taken goes remainder put put hey look see getting somewhere time going goes theres remainder put reckon youve probably worked highest common factor goes three times remainder highest common factor might anyway hopefully like method id like give big shout people learn bit side made video factor factorization working highest common factor people said hey dont method dont use method method much better thought hey right one thank lot guy think first person got thanks lot see next time bye common factor trick common factor trick common factor trick common factor trick common factor trick common factor trick common factor trick common factor trick common factor trick common factor trick common factor trick common factor trick common factor trick common factor trick common factor trick common factor trick common factor trick common factor trick
