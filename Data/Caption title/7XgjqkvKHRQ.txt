g'day welcome to the take math Channelwhat we 're going to be having a look atin today 's video is the fastest way ofworking at the highest common factor oftwo given numbers okay and when I saythis is the largest number that goesinto both and into two numbers that I'llgive you this is a really really fastand a very accurate way of doing thisokay so I 'll give you an example we'regoing to try and find I 'll give you 10seconds to find the greatest commonfactor the highest common factor thebiggest number that goes into both whatabout 196 and 84 so give you 10 secondsto do this and times just about uphopefully you have the highest commonfactor the greatest common factor of 28and if you had that excellent work ifnot I 'm going to show you how to workthis out and you might even have you gotit you might want to still have a lookat this method anyway okay so how do weget this greatest common factor soquickly I 'll show you how to do this sowhat we do is the following we look atour two numbers here are our 196 now 84and we 're basically going to choosewhich is the smallest one it is 84 andwe 're going to divide it into thelargest one 196 so 84 into 196 eightgoes 2 times because 84 times to 168there is a remainder of 28 okay that'sthis remainder that we 're going to beworried about for the next step we'regoing to move this remainder to on tothe next step okay so 28 were moving onto this next step the other part we moveto the next step is the smallest of ournumbers were the ones that we dividedinto another in this case it was theoriginal two numbers we had 196 84 thesmallest is 84 but if we were going onto the next another step and anotherstep would choose the smallest and ofsay these two okay so what we do is werepeat this step how many times is 28 gointo 84 hey it goes in three times itcomes in three times and there is noremainder the code goes in perfectly sowhat is no remainder here we stop thisbecause now we know the greatest commonfactor okayand it 's this number that we dividedinto okay the smaller our two numbershere okay so it 's 28did you get that so pretty much what wedo for this method is we interviewdividing the smaller number into thelarger number of our two numbers westart with their two numbers we'retrying to find the greatest commonfactor of and we 're going to be removingany remainder onto this next stage aswell as the smallest one of them fromthe previous step but we 're going tocontinue this - we get no remainder oncewe get no remainder the number thatwe 've divided into the other one okaythe smallest of these two that is ourgreatest common factor or our highestcommon factor okay so what about we havea look at a couple more examples what doI give you an example with one itprobably going to be I 'll look atstraight away and working out thefactors of so we had 72 and 60 now youmay look at this straight away and gohey K the highest common factor is thatand that that 's great if you can but I'mjust going to use it to show you thismethod so anyway we 're going to divide60 into 72 60 goes into 72 one time itgoes in one time and it has a remainderof 12 okay so this remainder we 're goingto put down here and we 're going to takethe smallest of these two numbers andwe 're going to use that for our nextpart so now we look at 60 and 12 howmany times does 12 go into 60 12 goesinto 60 five times with no remainder so12 is our highest common factor yeah didyou get that method okay what about ahwe 'll go through another one okay whatabout I 'll give you one I 'll go with Rone more together and then I 'll give youguys a couple so what about 148 and 48okay so we 're looking how many timesdoes 48 come to 148 it goes three timesokay148 goes in three times and it has aremainder of 4 okay so we 're going tomove this remainder here is 4 here andwe 're going to move the 48 here thesmaller of these two down to here now welook at how many times four goes into 48four goes into 48 twelve timesit goes in 12 times and there is noremainder so 4 is our highest commonfactoryeah what about I 'll give you a go doingthis okay so it 's the remain as we'reinterested in and this is a very veryold method this is a Euclidean method ofdoing this it 's fairly old okay whatabout you try this with a 130 and 78then you might want to pause the videoand and do this so hopefully you 've doneit hopefully you 've given it a goso we 're going to see how many timesseventy eight goes into 130 okay howmany times is going it goes in once andthere is a remainder of 52 okay so I'mgoing to put this 52 here and I 'm goingto move the smaller of these two numbersof 78 down here okay so now I see howmany times 52 goes into 70 goes in onceyeah it goes it once with a remainder of26 okay so now I 'm going to move this 26down here and move the remote here movethe smaller leaves through numbers the52 down here as wellokay how many times as 26 go into 52 itgoes in two times no remainder so ahighest common factor is 26 what aboutone last happy example for what are youguys okay and look this does work forreally really big numbers it 's excellentit 's probably the best method for usingwould be numbers obviously small numbersyou can use your multiplicationknowledge and that gets you fairly farbut with bigger numbers this is a reallyreally great method okay so what aboutwe give you this one what about our 585go really big number well it 's notreally big is it but it 's a big number585 and 105 you 're going to look alreadyin okay five goes into that but whatwould be the highest common factor ofthese two so we start out with so manytimes 105 goes into585 goes in five times you can see thatokay so five times 105 is going to be a525 there 's a remainder a 60 okay so Iput the 60 here and I move this hundredand five down from here okay all goodyeah okay how many times there 's now 60go into 105 goes in once the amp becausetwo times had taken up to 120 so it goesin once and it has a remainder a 45 okayso we put the 45 here put the 60 hereHey look you can see we 're gettingsomewhere 45 and 60 okay numbers gettingsmallerany time is 45 going to 60 goes in oncethen there 's 15 remainder okayso put the 15 here 45 I reckon you'vejust probably worked it out now what itis the highest common factor because 15goes into 45 it goes in three times butit has no remainder so at highest commonfactor now you might have guessed itit 's 15 anyway hopefully you like thismethod I 'd like to give a big shout outa few people will learn a bit to thisside I made a video and a factor thefactorization how working at the highestcommon factor and a few people said heywhy do n't you do this method why don'tyou use this method this method is muchbetter and I thought hey you 're right onthat one okay so so thank you a lot forthose guys Nikki I think was the firstperson who got that thanks a lot forthatanyway see you next time bye Greatest Common Factor Trick GCF Greatest Common Factor Trick GCF Greatest Common Factor Trick GCF
