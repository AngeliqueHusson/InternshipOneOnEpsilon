When people talk about the physics of American football , they normally mention force , torque , and so on¡­Like how the energy from two linemen colliding is enough to power a 60W light bulb for overa minute , or is equivalent to an average person falling two stories off of a building ! But there 's another aspect of physics in football that is n't talked about as much ¨C symmetry ! You might think symmetry is just for butterflies and rorschach tests , but it 's all over theplace in football : there 's translational symmetry when teams keep the same formations as theymove up or down the field , and rotational symmetry when they switch sides after a touchdown.Even the ball has axial symmetry so it can spin smoothly through the air.But why is symmetry useful in the first place ? Symmetry makes things easier , or at least more efficient ; it gives you a guide : `` samescenario , same action . `` That means you do n't have to reinvent the wheel all the time : to draw a straight line , you just keep drawing in the same direction.For a circle , keep curving the same amount.So when football players practice a play over and over , the patterns of football becomeso ingrained in their reflexes they can act without thinking.Psychologists call this `` habit formation '' ; we call it `` symmetry in time '' ! And when players line up on the field the same way at the thirty , or forty , or fiftyyard lines , that 's `` symmetry in space '' .Even physics itself is symmetric ¨C ever heard of Newton 's law : `` a body in motion tendsto stay in motion '' ? That 's just nature saying `` keep doing the same thing . `` What 's more , Newton 's laws of motion are the same now as they were yesterday , and they'llbe the same again tomorrow ! Does n't that make life easy ? Ultimately , symmetry is what allows both science AND football to function - if the laws ofthe universe ( or the rules of football ) changed from day to day , we would n't be able to repeatexperiments , make predictions , or know what plays to practice.So when you reach for yet another handful of chips while watching the next footballgame , know that millions across the country are doing exactly the same , in perfect symmetry .
