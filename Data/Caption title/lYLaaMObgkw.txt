use deductive reasoning distributive property justify x plus squared equal x squared plus squared provide reasoning step say use deductive reasoning stuff might seem like something daunting new different done past fact done exact problem let step step show logic essentially deductive reasoning starting statement going going equal something else let start x plus squared know exponent mean multiply something many times know thing deduce thing x plus times next x plus different color times x plus x plus squared say use distributive property bit review seen many many many times distributive property tell us times b plus c want many colors possible equal times term times b plus times cit cal led distributive property cause term expression multiplying exact thing could imagine x plus take entire x plus distribute term expression ax plus ay x plus multiply x plus times term distributive property distributive property going equal distribute x plus times x actually n even write x could write n matter whether multiply x times x plus x plus times x order n matter times going plus times x plus apply distributive property x x plus x plus let get equal x times x plus x times going great pain keep colors consistent plus times x plus times x plus times lot skipping step thing equal x times x thing x squared equal x squared right x one x also thing n matter order multiply x plus x last term right times thing squared used deductive reasoning used logical step start statement expression really essentially logically manipulate star ted guess could call statement guess best thing call logically manipulate come another statement another fact know equal logical distributive property thing like exponent deductive reasoning sequence series induction khan academy deductive reasoning sequence series induction khan academy deductive reasoning sequence series induction khan academy deductive reasoning sequence series induction khan academy deductive reasoning sequence series induction khan academy deductive reasoning sequence series induction khan academy deductive reasoning sequence series induction khan academy
