use deductive reasoning distributive property justify x plus squared equal x squared plus squared provide reasoning step say use deductive reasoning stuff might seem like something daunting new different weve done past fact weve done exact problem let step step show logic thats essentially deductive reasoning starting statement going going equal something else let start x plus squared know exponent mean multiply something many times know thing deduce thing x plus times ill next x plus different color times x plus thats x plus squared say use distributive property bit review weve seen many many many times distributive property tell us times b plus c want many colors possible equal times term times b plus times cal led distributive property cause term expression multiplying exact thing could imagine x plus take entire x plus distribute term expression ax plus ay x plus multiply x plus times term thats distributive property distributive property thats going equal well distribute x plus times x actually dont even write x could write doesnt matter whether multiply x times x plus x plus times x order doesnt matter thats times going plus times x plus apply distributive property x x plus x plus let get equal x times x plus x times going great pain keep colors consistent plus times x plus times x plus times reim lot skipping step thing equal x times x thing x squared equal x squared right x one x also thing doesnt matter order multiply x plus x last term right times thats thing squared done weve used deductive reasoning weve used logical step start statement expression really essentially logically manipulate star ted guess could call statement guess thats best thing call logically manipulate come another statement another fact know equal logical distributive property thing like exponent deductive reasoning sequence series induction khan academy deductive reasoning sequence series induction khan academy deductive reasoning sequence series induction khan academy deductive reasoning sequence series induction khan academy
