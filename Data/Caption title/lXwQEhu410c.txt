welcome often considered standard part algebra curriculum high school fit quadratics data mean well problem following ilk data value draw table x like five please x like output two excess handle like output say fifty find quadratic data precisely graphically mean trying find goes point point let see two point high find lovely quadratic produce sa nice parabola data well normally guess book following let plug x equal generic formula get plus b plus c equal output want plug x equal plus b plus c plug x equal tell b c three equation three really problem linear algebra guess book dont teach elimination must people plug calculator matrix perform mysterious matrix inverse calculator tell answer thats fine dandy mysterious propose different approach let write answer let let give quadratic goes going write right top head alright claim times x minus times x minus negative times negative times x minus x minus allover times negative plus let times x minus times x minus allover nine trick admit look frightening ghastly right analyze admit quadratic expand something x squared plus something next term plus constant term right conceptually piece cake though visually mess admit let play let play claim put x equal formula pop output dive done another way sort see three output sitting obviously three term let put one middle term x equal seal zero numerator also designed third term vanish x equal term play x first term put x equal numerator actually minus minus designed denominator exactly matching new mode case x times times quadratic give five times one plus zero plus zero output x output indeed foot x equal look done first term vanish es x equal put numerator goes away third x equal term middle term done numerator denominator nexus numerator going x minus times times negative decided nominate two completely mesh x plus times output indeed finally disease e designed polynomial output x first term vanish es goes away x second goes away term third term nine times times exactly denominator wrote denominator cancel one times plus zero plus yes indeed output visually messy nightmare quadratic actually easy understand conceptually designed trick work little algebra least following really five times times x minus x minus two negative thats negative x minus x minus let make get really got plus x minus x minus id like guess middle term negative hop skip jump basic algebra patience see actually x squared term going x squared term going tobe negative x squared term going set zer digital theres x squared term effects justice single x squared little bit thought negative x believe think going plus think see quadratic simple one disguise alright little bit work wish go final form like messy algebra doable algebra least conceptually know exactly much better black box calculator right piece cake let another one thats really firm idea want quadratic fit data write goes example ill make spot x x negative like output five place x output half nexus know give output quadratic thats going trick right let deal output first x negative like term vanish five right x negative need counteract numerator x negative negative bottom ill need great first term done id like output half id like occur x wan ted vanish negative vanish x whoops thats many hundred beginning term sorry mean mess sorry x negative going negative hundred thirty sorry back middle term group already x want term h counteract x term negative counteract finally third term x id like counteract x negative counter x negative leaving interest mean bottom need bottom theres quadratic trick actually know theres nothing unique quadratics suppose give four data point sand want cubic data piece cake write goes want gory idea simple suppose want negative comes cubic want output vanish x equal vanish x equal vantage x equal x actually one need nominate counteract effects x finger need negative negative plus output three want vanish x equal x equal x equal x equal need count counter x x negative need two term fast swift write brought equation line way wish let fun whoops let get pen back x suppose give two data point something comes line output three x equal one want term vanish x equal x need counteract plus output want vanish x equal nexus need counteract x need right theres trick pretty nasty line really x minus sex thats really two x got negative fourth positive fifteen fourth thats plus four line plus interesting thing occur ill leave maybe exercise let get right color pen give data set like quadratic x like output x like apple x like output formula break quadratic works happen try formula part exercise quadratic reverse direction data maybe give set data say make obvious whats going quadratic fit data actually linear try technique get linear equation try try writing quadratic works technique bet find term use technique approach thats little bit silly recognize linear wont fail fit quadratics set data like ease thanks fitting quadratics data mathematics
