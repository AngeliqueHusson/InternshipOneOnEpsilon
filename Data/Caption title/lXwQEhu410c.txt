welcome it 's often considered a standardpart of the algebra 2 curriculum in highschool to have kids fit quadratics todata what I mean by that well we givekids a problem of the following ilk hereare some data values this draws a tablewhen X is 1 like why to be five pleasewhen x is for like an output of two andwhen excess to handle like an output ofsay fifty can you find a quadratic thatfits that data precisely graphicallythat means I 'm trying to find a u-shapedcurve that goes to the point 15 and thepoint for let 's see two and the point 10way up should be about high 50 that isfind me a lovely quadratic that producesa nice parabola that fits this data wellhow do we normally have kids do this Iguess most books have the kids do thefollowing let 's plug in x equals 1 intothis generic formula so we get that aplus B plus C equals 5 is the output wewant plugin now x equals 4 that has been16 a plus 4 B plus C should be too andnow plug in x equals 10 that tells me100 a+ 10 b or c should be 50 that givesme three equations and three unknownsthat 's really problem linear algebra iguess most books do n't teach kidsgaussian elimination so what we mustmost people do is have kids plug thatinto a calculator and a matrix andperform this mysterious matrix inverseand have the calculator just tell youthe answer that 's fine and dandy butit 's mysterious and and not veryfulfilling I I propose that we just havedo different approach let 's just havekids write down the answer and let meshow you how let me give you the answerhere 's a quadratic that goes to the datai 'm just going to write it down rightnow on the top of my head alright iclaim 5 times X minus 4 times X minus 10all over negative 3 times negative 9plus 2 times X minus 1 X minus 10 allover 3 times negative 6 plus let 's see50 times X minus 1 times X minus 4 allover 9x 6 the nine there does the trick okay Iadmit that looks frightening and ghastlyright before I analyze it do you atleast admit it 's a quadratic if I wereto expand this out to be something withX Squared 's plus something with a nextterm plus a constant term all rightconceptually this is a piece of cakethough visually it is a mess I do admitbut let 's play with it let 's play withit I claim when you put x equals 1 intothis formula out pops an output of 5 andI 've done this another way you can sortof see the three outputs sitting here soobviously about three terms if you lookat this let 's put mexic was one I'vedesigned it so this middle term vanisheswhen x equals 1 to seal have zero inthis numerator I 've also designed thisthird term to vanish when x equals 1 asthe only term into play when X is 1 isthis first term when I put in x equals 1the numerator is actually 1 minus 4times 1 minus and 10 but I 've designedthe denominator be exactly matching thenew mode in this case so in X is 1 Ihave 5 times 27 / 27 5 times 1 so thisbut this quadratic gives me five timesone plus zero plus zero as an outputwhen X is 1 the output is indeed 5 let'stry that foot x equals 4 and look whatI 've done I 've arranged it so this firstterm vanishes at x equals 4 put and forthe numerator goes away this third termvanishes of x equals 4 the only termthat survives as the middle term andwhat had I done with the numerator thedenominator or a nexus for the numeratoris going to be 3 4 x minus 1 times 4minus 10 3 times negative 6 i 've decidedto nominate two completely mesh that sowhen x is for i have 0 plus 2 times 1plus 0 the output is indeed too andfinally it 's very disease e to seethey 've designed a polynomial so when xis 10 the output is 50 because when x isten this first term vanishes 10-10 goesaway when x is 10 the second termvanishes it goes away the only term thatsurvives is this third term and when Xis 10 the newer is nine 10-1 times 10-4nine times 6 which is exactly thedenominator i wrote down so thenumerator denominator cancels one andouts all overs 50 times 10 plus zeroplus 50 yes indeed of an output of 50 sothis visually messy nightmare of aquadratic is actually very easy tounderstand conceptually it 's designed todo the trick now I can work on and do alittle algebra here at the very least Ican do the following I really have fivetimes 127th so have 5 27 times X minus 4times X minus 10 and I have two and wasthat negative 18 so that 's negative 19 xminus 1 X minus 10 and 50 or let 's makethis 25 and 3 because I get a 27 then soI really got plus 25 27 x minus 1 Xminus 4 I 'd like I guess you about thismiddle term is negative 3 27 s now justhop skip and a jump basic algebra if youhave the patience I can see actually ifthe x squared term here is going to be 527 the x squared term here is going tobe negative 3 27 s and the x squaredterm is going to be 25 27 setzer 5-3that 's digital 227 's and 24 there 's 2727 s of the x squared term effectsjustice single x squared and a littlebit of thought is negative 6 x 's ibelieve and i think it 's going to beplus 10 i think you can see thatquadratic is this simple one in disguisealright so there was a little bit ofwork if you wish to go to this thisfinal form like a messy algebra doablealgebra but least conceptually I knowexactly what I 'm doing it 's much betterto me than the black box of a calculatorall right piece of cake let 's just doanother one that 's really firm up thisidea if you want to quadratic fit somedata just write it down here goes let'stry an example I 'll make this up on thespot x y when x is negative 3 at like anoutput a five-place when x is 5 and AGan output of half the nexus I know 110please give me an output of sevenhere 's the quadratic that 's going to dothe trick all right let 's deal with anoutput of 5 first when X is negative 3I 'd like this term to vanish at five andat 10 all right but when X is negative 3I need to counteract this numerator sowhen X is negative 3 on these negative 8on the bottom and I 'll need a negative13 great first term done now I 'd like anoutput of a half I 'd like that to occurwhen X is 5 so I wanted to vanish for xequals negative 3 and to vanish for whenX is 110 whoops that 's many hundred tenthe beginning term I 'm sorry oops allthat means no changing it so I mess thisup for you I 'm so sorry when X is anegative 3 is going to be negativehundred thirty sorry back to the middleterm oops I 'm a group already x is 5 Iwant a term of H to counteract x equals5 and a term of negative 105 tocounteract and finally the third term atx is 7 i 'd like to counteract x beingnegative 3 counter x being negative 5and being 5 leaving me with just xequals 110 of interest which means a 913on the bottom and I need 105 on thebottom there it is there 's a quadraticthat does the trick actually you knowthere 's nothing unique about quadraticshere suppose I give you four data pointsand you want a cubic that fits that datapiece of cake just write it down here itgoes I want to do all the gory detailsbecause the idea is simple 1238 supposeI want 731 negative 5 here comes mycubic I want to output a 7 to vanish atx equals to vanish at x equals 3 intovantage of x equals 8 when X is actuallyone I need to nominate a counteract theeffects of X finger once I need negative1 negative 2 negative 7 plus 1 andoutput of three I want that to vanish atx equals 1 x equals 3 and x equals 8 butsurvived when x equals 2 so I need noman that counts counter x.x being 2 1negative 1 negative 6and so on I need two more terms that wasvery fast but very Swift to write downhe brought the equation of a line thisway if we wish why not let 's have funwhoops let 's get the pen back XY supposeI give you just two data points 1 3 5 11or something here comes by line onoutput of three when x equals one but Iwant this term to vanish x equals 5 andwhen X is 1 I need to counteract thatplus on an output of 11 I want to vanishx equals 1 but my Nexus 5 and need totrim to counteract that when X is 1 05or need for all right there 's the linedoes the trick it 's pretty nasty linebut it 's really 11 for X minus 3 for sexthat 's really two x 's and I got anegative 11 fourths and I have positivefifteen fourths that 's plus four fourthsplus 1 the line is 2x plus 1 are someinteresting things can occur and I'llleave these as maybe exercises whathappens let 's get the right color pen ifI give your data set like this here 's aquadratic when X is 2 like an output of5 and X is 1 like an apple of 10 andwhen X is 2 like an output of 15 can yousee that the formula should break downthere is no quadratic that works forthis but what happens if you try myformula part to my exercise is there aquadratic in the reverse direction thatfits this data maybe there is what if igive you a set of data say make thisvery obvious what 's going on when y is 1and 12 when y is for 18 + 1 Y is 10about 20 it does a quadratic fit thatdata no it 's actually linear but what ifI try the technique do I get a linearequation popping out of it try it so trywriting a quadratic that works this wayusing this technique and I bet you findthat a is 0you those terms in for use this this isa technique in an approach that 's alittle bit silly because you recognizeits linear it wo n't fail you there weare fit quadratics to any set of datayou like from now on with ease thanks Fitting Quadratics to Data (Mathematics: James Tanton) Fitting Quadratics to Data (Mathematics: James Tanton) Fitting Quadratics to
