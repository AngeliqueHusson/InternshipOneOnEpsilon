ROGER BOWLEY : The number I want to talk about now is thesquare root of 2.JAMES GRIME : My favorite fact about root 2 ? Well , if you take the A series of paper.So this is A4 paper.It 's pretty standard in most of the world.If you take a piece of paper like this , if you look at theratio between the long edge and the short edge , whichmeans if you measure the long edge , and you divide by theshort edge , it will be the square root of 2.And they picked this on purpose.ROGER BOWLEY : The square root of 2 is about 1.41something or other.And it 's the number you get if you work with Pythagoras'Theorem , which said that if you have a unit length alongthere , and a unit length along there.So this length , the square of this length plus the square ofthat is that.This length is root 2 , it's the square root of 2.JAMES GRIME : If I fold this piece of paper in half -- let 's try that out.This now is something called A5 paper.We started with A4.This is now A5 paper.And if you do the same thing again , if you take the longedge of this and divide by the short edge , it will again bethe square root of 2.The ratio is the same.They do this so that you can scale things up and scale themdown without it being disproportionate.ROGER BOWLEY : Square root of 2 is this , which is 1.41.Well , it runs on forever.It does n't stop at a particular point.And there are a whole range of these.This is just the first of many.Another one is pi.JAMES GRIME : In fact , they start off with A0.An A0 is defined to be a piece of paper , which has a ratio , square root of 2 , and it has an area of one meter squared.In fact , root 2 is the only ratio where this works.And I 'm going to show that it 's theonly ratio this works.There you go.Well , our rectangular piece of paper.This is your long edge , which I 'm going to call a , and thisis your short edge , which I 'm going to call b.Now , if I take the long edge , a , and divide by the shortedge , b , I 'll get a ratio.It 's actually going to be root 2 , but let 's pretend we don'tknow that yet.But this is what I want.If I cut this in half , I want this now to be the long edge.So b is now the long edge.The short edge is actually half of a , thisside , half of a.Now I want that to be the same ratio as I had before.In other words , I want these two things to be equal.So all we have to do now is rearrange this , play with this a little.Let 's see what we get.OK.Let 's take the b 's over this side , the a 's over this side.If you play with it , you will get a squared on the left , and2 b squared on the right-hand side.Or , in other words , a squared divided by b squared equals 2.Or , square root it , square root both sides.And you 'll get a divided by b on the left.And on the right , you get the square root of 2.And this was actually the ratio we wanted to find.The only ratio where this works is the square root of 2.JAMES GRIME : This is Pythagoras' Theorem.Pythagoreans were a cult way , way back.And there might have been a figure called Pythagorasassociated with this.But they were very strange bunch.And they believed in this theorem.They believed in the harmony of natural numbers.So if you want to do music , you took a bit of string ofcertain tension.If you took half the length , you 'll get aharmonious note with it.They thought all of nature was composed of numbers.They thought that everything could either be expressed as apure integer or a ratio of integers.That was their fundamental core belief.JAMES GRIME : What did they know ? They had the numbers one , two , three , four , five.They had worked out the fractions , that you coulddivide two things together , 3/5 , 1/2 , that sort of thing.ROGER BOWLEY : They had other beliefs , as well.That you should n't marry a woman who wore gold jewelry , for example.Or you should be a vegetarian.And you shouldn't eat fava beans.And you should n't urinate towards the sun.There was a disciple of this strange sect called Hippasus.And he worked out that if you believed in this theorem , Pythagoras Theorem , then you could show mathematically aproof showing that this number is not aratio of two integers.JAMES GRIME : But a number that could not be written as afraction , that was a new thing that went on forever.That 's what an irrational number is.ROGER BOWLEY : And they disliked this so much.I ca n't begin to tell you how much they disliked it.So they took him out to sea , according to legend , and hedid n't come back.Somehow , either they drowned him or left himon a deserted island.He was n't seen again.JAMES GRIME : They did , apparently -- they suppressed this information.They were n't sure that this was a real thing.ROGER BOWLEY : We call them now irrational numbers becausethey do n't fit in with this Pythagorean viewpoint.JAMES GRIME : It 's the same sort of problem that peoplehave today.People say to me , oh , I 've heard of complex numbers , I'veheard of that.I do n't believe they exist.I do n't understand it.Same problem , they do exist.It 's just you have to get used to it.ROGER BOWLEY : So he was one of the first people to bepersecuted for proving people wrong withtheir previous ideas.And this has gone on through history.I mean , I could tell you about physicists who 've suffered , like Bruno Giordano , who went to -- burnt at the stake for saying the universe was infinite.And the Catholic church said , well , that does n't leave anyroom for God.JAMES GRIME : We 're going to prove that root 2 isirrational.It can not be written as a fraction.The way we prove this is a really powerful , usefulmathematical proof called contradiction.We 're going to assume the opposite.I 'm going to assume you can write it as a fraction.Let 's assume we can write it as a divided by b .And this a and b are special.They are integers.They are whole numbers.They 're one , two , three , four , five.They 're something like that.And they 're in their smallest possible terms.So we 're not including things like 2 divided by 4 becausethat 's a half.That 's not in its smallest possible terms.All right.Let 's see what we can do.ROGER BOWLEY : If you come up with an idea which is rightbut goes against conventional wisdom , you can be sent to adesert island , or burned at the stake , or executed.Because people do n't like their ideas about how theworld should be upset.Even if you can disprove it , it 's not a good idea tourinate towards the sun.JAMES GRIME : I 'm going to square both sides.So on the left-hand side , I get a 2.On the right-hand side , I get a squareddivided by b squared.This time , a and b are whole numbers , remember.Let 's play with it.We get 2b squared on the left equals a squared on the right.Now what I 've shown here is I 've shown thata squared is even.Because it 's a multiple of 2 , it 's an even number.And you can show that because a squared is even , a is even as well.Well , if it was two odd numbers squared , that would bean odd number.So yeah , yeah , if a squared is even , the original number , a , that was even.So a is even.OK.So a is even.Let 's call it something else , let 's call it aequals 2 times c.So what do we have now ? 2b squared on the left-hand side is 2 times c because it'seven , squared.This is equal to 4c squared.In other words , I'm saying b squaredis equal to 2c squared.Can you see that ? b squared is even.If b squared is even , like before , b is even.What I 've shown is a is even and b is even.That 's a problem.They ca n't both be even.Like my example of 2 divided by 4 , it 's not in its smallestpossible terms if they're both even.So this is an impossible fraction.It does n't exist.You can not write root 2 as a fraction like this . test
