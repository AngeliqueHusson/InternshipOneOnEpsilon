walk street say please tell didnt want write thick please tell sine pi obviously assuming dealing either memorize would draw unit circle right thats best looking unit circle get idea youd go pi radian thing would draw unit radius sine defined unit circle would want know value right would immediately say draw triangle little bit triangle look like solve triangle hypotenuse x x theyre going isosceles triangle right base angle say look x squared plus x squared equal squared equal squared equal equal square root one square root put rational form multiplying square root get x equal square root height square root wan ted know distance would also thing height sine value sine height right got square root review learned unit circle video someone else let say another day come say please tell square root like know sine angle new trigonometric function sal devise dand realize word arc front also sometimes refer red inverse sine could easily written inverse sine square root angle would take sine order get value square root also angle would take sine order get square root could rewrite either statement saying square let could rewrite either statement saying sine equal square root think much easier question answer sine square root figured sine pi square root case know sine pi equal square root question mark equal pi could written arc sine square root equal pi might say review giving value saying give angle give take sine angle give value like hey go like look pi degree worked could keep degree could keep would work would get point unit circle right youd correct value would think would right take sine angle could keep take sine would get square root thats problem cant function take function cant function f x map multiple value right map pi map pi plus pi plus piso order valid function order inverse sine function valid range way well restrict range natural place let restrict range actually side note whats domain restricted taking arc sine something taking arc sine x saying equal theta whats domain restricted valid value x x could equal well take sine angle negative right x going greater equal negative less equal domain order make valid function restrict range possible value si restrict arc sine convention restrict first fourth restrict possible angle area right along unit circle theta restricted less equal pi greater equal minus pi given understand arc sine islet another problem clear space another let say ask arc sine minus square root might memorize dand say immediately know sine x sine theta square root youd done dont let draw unit circle dealing arc sine first fourth quadrant unit circle thats sine something minus square root mean unit circle minus square root mean right minus square root angle give think little bit minus square root angle going negative angle going x axis clockwise direction figure let draw little triangle pick better color thats triangle let blue let zoom triangle like theta thats theta whats length right well thats height guess could call square root minus going let figure angle know negative angle see square root hopefully recognize triangle square root side course side unit circle radius triangle side opposite square root side know theta magnitude going minus theta equal minus dealing radian good enough multiply times sorry pi every cancel left theta equal minus pi radian sand say make statement minus square root equal pi could say inverse sign minus square root equal minus pi radian sand confirm let let get little calculator put radian mode already check per second radian mode know going get hopefully right answer want figure inverse sign inverse sine second sine button minus square root equal minus telling equal minus pi must equal see confirm write minus pi divided get exact value calculator gave exact value might helpful calculator doesnt tell minus pi inverse trig function arc sin trigonometry khan academy inverse trig function arc sin trigonometry khan academy inverse trig function arc sin trigonometry khan academy inverse trig function arc sin trigonometry khan academy inverse trig function arc sin trigonometry khan academy inverse trig function arc sin trigonometry khan academy inverse trig function arc sin trigonometry khan academy inverse trig function arc sin trigonometry khan academy
