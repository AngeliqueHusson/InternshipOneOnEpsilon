DR. JAMES GRIME : Yeah , I 'm going to tell you a story , butwhat I thought I 'd start with is a little puzzle.And then while people are thinking about the puzzle , I 'll tell you a little story , one of the big legends ofmathematics.And then we 'll see what the answer to the puzzle was.The puzzle is fairly easy to state.I just want you to add up the digits from 1 to 1 million.Now I want you to add up all the digits -- if you imagine you've wrote out thenumbers 1 to 1 million.I want you to add up all the digits , not the numbers.So if I want to say 123 plus 124 , that 's notwhat I want to do.I want to add up all the digits of those numbers , 1plus 2 plus 3 plus 1 plus 2 plus 4.Imagine writing a list of all the numbers from 1 to 1million with all those digits , and I want you to add up allthe digits.And what answer will you get ? While you think about that , I'm going to tell you one ofthese famous mathematical stories.So this is the story of Gauss.Carl Gauss.Carl Gauss is possibly one of the greatest mathematicians ofthe last few hundred years.He really is a really large figure.Now the story goes that when he was nine , he started toattend , at school , his arithmetic class.Now arithmetic class would include lots of boys , all theway up to the age of 15.Imagine , right ? This is 1780 we 're talking about , a long time ago.Imagine it 's a drab schoolroom , and it 's veryworn , and the floor was uneven.And the teacher was also drab and worn and uneven himself.Apparently he was quite a bully.He would walk around with his cane and hewould thrash the boys.Now one day , to keep them quiet -- yeah , this 'll keep 'em quiet for an hour -- he gave them a problem -- to add up all the numbers from 1 to 100.So add up all the numbers from 1 to 100.So 1 plus 2 plus 3 plus 4 plus -- all the way up to 100.That was the problem he gave the pupils.And they had to write on slates in those days.And when you got the solution , you would put your slate onthe teacher 's table.Now Gauss , when he was given this problem , immediatelythrew his slate onto the teacher'stable with an answer.Now the other boys continued their work , adding up all thenumbers , multiplying and adding and subtracting , whatever they had to do.This brute of a teacher strolled around the classroom , throwing just pitying looks at poor Gauss , this guessing theanswer and throwing it onto the table.When the hour was over , he took the stack of slates , turned them over so that Gauss's answer was on the top , and read out the answer.To his astonishment , he got the answer right.The answer is 5,050.Which meant that Gauss was able to solve it in seconds.How did he solve it ? Well , he had a trick.The trick was , he noticed that if you addthe numbers in pairs -- I 'm going to start with 1 and I 'm going to add it to 100.What you get is 101.Now if you take the second number and add it to thesecond to last number , 99 , you get 101.You take 3 and add it to 98 , you get 101.In fact , each pair that you make in thisway would equal 101.How many pairs do you make ? Well , there 's 100 there.50 pairs , you make.So he just took 101 and timesed it by50 , and he got 5,050.So this story was first written about in an obituaryby one of Carl Gauss's friends.Apparently , Carl Gauss would tell this story himself.So it seems to be fairly true.Some embellishments over the years have been thebrutishness of this teacher , with thiscane and his thrashing.That 's been added onto over the years.The problem I gave you about adding the numbers 1 to 100 , that 's been added onto over the years , as well.We do n't know what the original problem was.So to finish our puzzle now , maybeyou 've got time to think.We 're going to use this method that , well , Gauss may haveused to solve his problem.But we were adding the numbers 1 to 1 million.But we were n't adding the numbers.I threw in a twist.We were adding all the digits of the numbers.So let 's just write out the numbers first.I 'll start with 1.Then I 'll have 2 , and 3 , and 4.I 'm going to skip a few.And then we 'll go to the end.Let 's go to something like 999,995 , 999,996 -- getting there -- 999,999.And let 's have 1,000,000.There we go.Right.So we were going to add up all the digits , though.Well , how about this ? Let 's just start with the 0.I 'm going add on the 0.I did n't say that before , but let 's add on a 0there at the front.If I use pairs , 0 paired up with 999,999 -- if you add those together , you get this number , 999,999.If you try this pair , we get the same answer , of course.And 2 plus this one.And do 3 and 999,996.And 4 with 999,995.And all those pairs equal the same thing.Now if all those pairs equal the same thing , we can now addup these digits.And this gives me -- what does this give ? 9 plus 9 plus 9 plus 9 plus 9 plus 9 ? 54.And how many pairs have I made ? Half a million.Times half a million.Which is equal to -- it 's actually equal to 27 million.So all the digits added up to 27 million , except I have leftout my 1,000,000 there.I did n't add that in my pair , did I ? So let 's add up up those digits , too.That is 1.So we add that on.And so the answer is , adding all the numbers -- all the digits of the numbers -- from 1 to 1 millionis 27,000,001 , using Gauss 's trick.MALE SPEAKER : Now at this point , you can go wild , right ? How many -- how many arrows do you want ? So the next one , let 's say we did 3 to the power of , to thepower of , to the power -- or arrow , arrow , arrow , orwhatever you want to call this.3 -- well that , that -- One to One Million - Numberphile One to One Million - Numberphile One to One Million - Numberphile
