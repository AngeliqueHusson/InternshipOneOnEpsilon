find the area of the trapezoid so thearea of a trapezoid I 'll say that a andI 'll put a little small T here so thatwe 're finding the area of the trapezoidthe easiest way to think about it is itis the average of the bases times theheight so the average of the basis is 15plus 11 divided by 2 sometimes you'llsee in formulas this is base 1 this isbase 2 this is base 1 base 2 a trapezoidI 've assessed to parallel bases so it'sthe average of the bases 15 plus 11 over2 times the height and the height hereis 4 centimeters times 4 and this unitsthese are the units here are incentimeters the units here andcentimeters so when you multiply ityou 're going to get centimeters squaredbut let 's actually evaluate it so 15plus 11 is 36 so this is going to be 36or sorry it 's 26 15 plus 11 is 26divided by 2 is 13 and then you have 13times 4 times 4 which is equal to 40plus 12 it 's 52 and then squarecentimeters and we 're done we found thearea of the trapezoid and if you'rewondering why does this why does thisthing here make sense and one way tothink about it is imagine imagine youwere to take the area of just of justusing this base so if you were to lookat the rectangle that has this base andthat height and you would have this areathat I 'm showing you in white if I justtook 11 times 4 you would get this arearight over there so 11 times 4 would bethis area right over here and if I took15 times 4 I would get this entirerectangle I would get this entirerectangle so 15 times 4 would be theentire rectangle so even include some ofthis area that is not included in thetrapezoid and if you look at light ifyou look at this and it 's not a rigorousproof but it 's giving you the intuitionwhy this is the formula the actual areaof the trapezoid is exactly in betweenthese two areas it 's in between thiswhite areaand thus larger the area of the largerrectangle and you could see that becausethere 's these lines divided the kind ofthe difference between the two areasit divides them in two so the area ofthe trapezoid is actually if you averagethese two numbers so if you if you addthem together and you divide by twowhich is the same thing as four timesthe average of the bases 11 plus 15 over2 either way this is the answer 52centimeters squared Area of a Trapezoid Area of a Trapezoid Area of a Trapezoid
