find area trapezoid area trapezoid ill say put little small finding area trapezoid easiest way think average bases times height average basis divided sometimes formula base base base assessed parallel bases average bases plus times height height centimeter times multiply going get centimeter squared let actually evaluate going sorry plus times equal done found area trapezoid thing make sense one way think imagine imagine take area base rectangle base height would area showing white took times would get times would area right times would get entire rectangle would get entire rectangle times would entire rectangle even include area included trapezoid look light look rigorous proof giving intuition formula actual area trapezoid exactly two white area thus area could see theres divided kind difference two area sit two area trapezoid actually average two add together divide two thing four times average bases plus either way answer squared area trapezoid area trapezoid area trapezoid area trapezoid area trapezoid area trapezoid area trapezoid
