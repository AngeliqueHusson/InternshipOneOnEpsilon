think already video making one problem theres two different ways first way transfer exponential form right logarithm transfer next bunch form e negative first evaluate e take divided equal x way could abase e right base e get rid logarithm whole goal guy remember x whole goal get x equal right well logarithm kind goal really logarithm unless right logarithm pretty much tell us gon na approximate answer always try get rid logarithm dont really want dealing avoid get rid logarithm raise raise e e going equal right gon na raise whole equation lot x equal e negative one one property got guy scan raise e raised happen x equal e make first natural logarithm given problem natural logarithm given problem natural logarithm given problem natural logarithm given problem natural logarithm given problem natural logarithm given problem
