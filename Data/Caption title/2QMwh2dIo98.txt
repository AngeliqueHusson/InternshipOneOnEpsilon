brightstorm has thousands of highquality videos covering all majorsubjects please check out more at WWDCstorm calm there are two properties whenwe 're talking about circles that areeasily confused arc length versus arcmeasure to compare arc length in arcmeasure let 's look at some concentriccircles let 's say I drew in two radii inthe smaller circle and I called thatintercepted arc arc a let 's say Iextended those radii all the way out tothe larger circle and I 'm going to callthat arc be so again we 're trying tocompare arc measure with arc length andI see that since it has the same centralangle since RK and art be have the samecentral angle I could say that themeasure the arc measure of a is equal tothe arc measure of B but if we look atthe distance between the interceptedarcs endpoints we can see pretty clearlythat the length l ng th of arc a isdefinitely smaller than the length of Bso it is possible for two arcs to havethe same measure but different lengthsarc length is the fraction of a circlecircumference so if we look at a circleover here where I 've drawn a right angleand I said what is the distance betweenX Y if we know the whole circle has acircumference of C where C is somecircumference we know that the fractionhere it 's pretty clear is just going tobe a fourth of that because 90 degreesis one-fourth of the circle so if acircle is 360 90 is one-fourth so theway that we calculate arc length is if Ihave some circle with an arc a be thelength of that is the circumference ofthe whole circle times the fraction ofthe circle so this part right here tellsyou if you know measure of Arc a be justwrite it over 360 and nowtell you how much of the circle are youusing so for see you could eithersubstitute 2 PI R because that'scircumference in terms of radius isequal to the measure of Arc a be out of360 or if you wanted to you could alsouse PI times diameter x measure of Arc abe out of 360 so the key thing here isthat arc length is a fraction of thecircle circumference so we 're talkingabout a distance which is why you canhave the same arc measure but differentarc lengths and by two I ca n't do thiswith you too laughing back there so ifwe had no that 's not right threeco-player points so have you ever gottenup a airplane that should be yeah dangit 's like 500 degrees in here what allright when you 're in chemistry classthey 're gon na be doing a lot of workyou 're gon na go sunny over so as anexample we can consider like you 've gota chain hanging from to UM to fix Arc Length(HD) Arc Length(HD) Arc Length(HD)
