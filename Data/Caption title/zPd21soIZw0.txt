talking solid thats sphere calculate volume formula v equal pi times couple thing formula geometry classes wont make prove going get derivation second key thing notice many variable sare used formula one thing need know order calculate volume sphere radius let look quick example could use formula sphere find volume notice give radius put diameter going start writing formula volume equal pi times radius cube something notice r remind talking volume surface area said r going behalf since diameter volume equal times pi times cube use calculator sorry volume equal pi times going multiply calculator number volume equal pi write theres one dimension need know order calculate volume sphere radius problem divide half diameter could substitute find volume volume sphere volume sphere volume sphere volume sphere volume sphere volume sphere volume sphere volume sphere volume sphere volume sphere volume sphere volume sphere volume sphere volume sphere
