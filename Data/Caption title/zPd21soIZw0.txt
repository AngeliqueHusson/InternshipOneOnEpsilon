if you 're talking aboutthree-dimensional solid that 's a sphereyou can calculate its volume using theformula V equals 4/3 pi times the radiuscubed now a couple things about thisformula most geometry classes wo n't makeyou prove it so I 'm not going to getinto that derivation second key thingabout this is notice how many variablesare used in this formula one the onlything you need to know in order tocalculate the volume of a sphere is itsradius so let 's look at a quick exampleabout how we could use that formula herewe have a sphere and we 're being askedto find its volume now notice that whatthey give you is not a radius put adiameter so we 're going to start off bywriting our formula volume equals 4/3 pitimes your radius cubed now somethingthat you should notice is that we have Rto the 3rd which reminds you that we aretalking about volume and not a surfacearea so we said that R is going to behalf of 12 since 12 is our diameter sovolume equals 4/3 times pi times 6 cubednow 6 cubed if I use my calculator is216 sorry same volume is equal to 4/3 pitimes 216 I 'm going to multiply 4 thirdsby 216 on my calculator that should endup with some number larger than 216 andI do so volume is equal to 288 pi andthen we have to write in our units cubiccentimeters so there 's only onedimension that you need to know in orderto calculate the volume of a sphere andthat is your radius in this problem wehad to divide 12 and a half because thatwas a diameter so we could substituteand find our volume Volume of Spheres Volume of Spheres Volume of Spheres
