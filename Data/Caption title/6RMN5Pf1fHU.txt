consider line p line q also parallel would mean intersect ever meet transversal r cut p q two distinct point sin video try understand different type angle formed transversal two parallel transversal form four angle line four angle line move first type p q parallel angle always equal angle angle equal one cal led corresponding angle sit doesnt matter transversal angle always equal new page let us try moving transversal around assume line line b parallel transversal c see two angle look equal let rotate transversal towards right two angle seem equal let rotate transversal towards left angle become obtuse still equal tell us corresponding angle always equal let go back previous page let ask interesting question look figure closely pair corresponding three pair corresponding transversal intersect pair parallel pair corresponding angle formed two six form corresponding angle pair angle two always equal angle six even look figure observe equal similarly angle three equal angle seven angle four equal angle eight four pair corresponding angle interior two parallel line sand classified two understand first type angle angle form pair alternate interior know cal led interior exactly cal led alternate round table around alternate skip position take next similarly alternate diagram well find alternate skip position take next similarly angle angle also cal led alternate interior first type interior second type pair angle next side transversal like angle angle cal led consecutive interior figure see pair consecutive interior logic even angle consecutive interior two type interior consecutive alternate skip one move next consecutive take one thats immediately next last type angle formed vertically opposite cal led vertically opposite angle sin pair vertically opposite angle angle angle pair sand vertically opposite angle always equal different type angle formed transversal meet two parallel line son new page let look beauty b parallel transversal c intersect two distinct already know transversal form eight two three four five six seven eight let us quickly analyze relation various angle formed pretty simple actually angle two equal angle six corresponding angle san angle eight equal angle six vertically opposite angle four equal angle eight corresponding angle one equal angle five corresponding seven equal angle five vertically opposite angle three equal angle seven corresponding b parallel see angle one three five seven equal angle two four six eight equal different angle formed transversal two parallel different angle formed transversal two parallel different angle formed transversal two parallel different angle formed transversal two parallel different angle formed transversal two parallel different angle formed transversal two parallel
