let say something moving constant velocity five per second assuming moving right give us direction vector quantity moving direction right let plot velocity velocity actually going plot magnitude velocity specify like magnitude velocity axis going plot constant velocity five per second magnitude five per second constant second tick away velocity change moving five per second question far thing travel five five second one second two second three second four second five second right far thing travel five second swell could think two ways one know velocity equal displacement change time displacement change position change time another way think multiply sides change time get velocity times change time equal displacement displacement well know velocity five per second thats velocity let color code velocity know change time five second sand get second cancel get five times five equal meter sand thats pretty straightforward slightly interesting thing thats exactly area rectangle right going show video general plot velocity magnitude velocity could say speed versus time let stay magnitude velocity versus time area curve going distance traveled displacement displacement velocity times change take rectangle right let draw slightly different onewhere velocity let draw situation constant acceleration acceleration going one meter per second per second one meter per second let draw type graph although going look little different velocity axis ill give little bit space velocity going draw magnitude velocity right time axis time let mark stuff one two three four five six seven eight nine ten one two three four five six seven eight nine ten magnitude velocity going measured per second time going measured initial velocity could say magnitude initial velocity initial speed could say fancy way saying initial speed zero initial speed zero one second whats going happen one second going one meter per second faster going one meter per second two second whats going another meter per second faster another second go forward time change time one second second faster remember idea slope algebra one class thats exactly acceleration diagram right acceleration know acceleration equal change velocity change time change time along right change time right change velocity plot velocity magnitude velocity relative time slope line acceleration since assuming acceleration constant constant slope line dont curve want think say accelerate one meter per second change time going five second sand question far traveled slightly interesting question weve far start initial velocity zero five second accelerate one meter per second squared one two three four five second know velocity velocity five per second far traveled could think little bit visually could say look could try draw rectangle maybe right velocity one meter per second say one meter per second times give little bit distance next one little bit distance calculated way could keep drawing rectangle like wait rectangle missing wasnt whole second wasnt going one meter per second kept actually maybe split rectangle si could split rectangle even maybe go every half second half second going velocity go velocity times time would give displacement next half second exact idea displacement forth think see getting accurate smaller try make closer going get area curve like situation area curve going distance traveled lucky us going triangle know figure area triangle area triangle equal one half times base times height hopefully make sense multiply base times height get area entire rectangle triangle exactly half distance traveled situation say displacement want make sure displacement going say magnitude displacement maybe thing distance going one half times base five second times height five per second times five another color five per second second cancel second sand left one half times five times five one half times equal meter sand theres interesting thing well one theres couple interesting realize plotting velocity versus time area curve given certain amount time tell far traveled interesting thing slope acceleration whats slope well completely flat thats velocity situation constant acceleration magnitude acceleration exactly zero velocity acceleration one meter per second thats slope line right one interesting thing even constant acceleration could still figure distance taking area curve like able figure able get last thing want introduce actually let next video ill introduce idea average velocity feel comfortable idea distance traveled area velocity versus time
