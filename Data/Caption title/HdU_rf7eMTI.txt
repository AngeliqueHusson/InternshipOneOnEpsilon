hi welcome math antic sin video cal led long division learned division problem long key break big division problem series smaller easier division step sand involved trying divide dividend one digit example saw going pretty easy one digit need use division method problem bigger divisor dividing two three digit number lesson gon na learn handle problem like good news kind already know may realize yet see mean look two division problem dividend one digit divisor divisor different see going effect division process solve first problem start many take make almost think many fit easy see answer put first digit answer multiply times subtract leaves us remainder move next digit need bring copy combine remainder first digit ask many make easy put next digit minus leaves remainder finally last digit even though remainder bring copy ask many make answer exactly leaves remainder went broke problem three division step one digit got answer let solve next example right start see bit problem ask many take make almost answer none first digit taken less big divide well instead trying divide first digit let group first two together group together first step ask many make divide times put answer line right go skip first digit group wan ted could put zero first digit since divide times help keep track answer digit good idea minus give us remainder one digit left divide bring copy combine remainder ask many make know answer leaves remainder answer notice difference two problem wan ted go problem second problem divisor bigger first digit dividend start going time case help us see something really important traditional long division method always go one digit time break dividend bigger want apply procedure bigger could go two three time even try divide entire dividend one step taking bigger divided usually result division three step first problem two step second step like sound seem like lot less work ah division step sound better really group together harder division step thought good true kind like climbing lot small step one easy climb big step one challenge always try go one digit time divide one two dividend time much easier answer smaller division step found multiplication table memorize right go time lot harder figure answer relate two digit divisor see two digit divisor force us take bigger step see mean let try two new division problem dividend two new divisor two digit divisor sin first problem could start many fit since divisor two already know one digit chunk dividend big enough divide two digit divisor automatically need group first two ask many make multiple multiplication table instead figure good guessing know times would really good estimate first digit times subtract get remainder far already dealt first two dividend bring last digit join remainder ask many make easy saw times leave remainder answer first two digit divisor problem let look next problem also got two digit divisor start way start two digit chunk dividend ask many take make almost u h oh problem even though two work already greater mean going take even bigger chunk dividend need group first three together like whole problem without breaking step division problem big divisor get difficult two three digit divisor step might big whole long division problem take lot trial error figure fact way math antic division problem get complicated let student use calculator solve want calculator want whenever long division two digit divisor get way need solve problem without calculator best strategy well little help us make much better guess es answer kind hard work made estimate change would make easier estimate answer since would divide exactly times mean divide least many times let make first estimate answer check see good estimate multiply subtract see remainder tricky may want use scratch paper work times subtract get remainder look like estimate low whenever remainder greater equal divisor mean underestimate answer fact since remainder equal divisor mean could divided exactly one picked multiply times see see even though division procedure basically case value divisor make big difference division divisor bigger part dividend trying divide mean need group take bigger division try one much longer two digit divisor divided gon na work fast may want watch couple times trouble following since two digit divisor start first dividend ask many take make gon na use rounding help us estimate close really close since times estimate first answer digit minus leaves remainder know estimate right less divisor move next digit bring copy combine ask many take make one easier estimate easy see two would minus leaves remainder next bring copy ask many take make bit estimate round know five make estimate next answer minus leaves remainder bring copy next digit ask many take make u h oh big enough divided worry already know trying divide bigger number smaller number put zero answer line move next digit bring copy combine remainder ask many take make estimate one going round since put answer line minus leaves remainder done wow lot work see much rounding us made good estimate time rounding working know long division procedure works two digit divisor sit division step involve two three dividend since bigger step harder figure want use help find answer sand good know complex division problem like still think complex division problem job calculator try practice problem wear really long division like reason study math become good problem solver able understand sort important math lot math division always thanks watching math antic see
