got a right triangle and you 're droppingan altitude okay to the hypotenuse okayso that these are both right angles andwhat we end up with is three trianglesone two and overall triangle threetriangles that are all similar to oneanother because the corresponding anglesare congruent so the sides are going tobe proportional so what comes out ofthat is is that we 've got two formulashere we have the leg okay leg one is thegeometric mean okay of the hypotenusewhich is this whole length okay timesthe part of the hypotenuse that'sadjacent to that leg that 's closest tothat leg so these are the means theseare the extremes and the leg one is thegeometric mean of the hypotenuse thiswhole hypotenuse and a part of thehypotenuse that 's closest to that legwhen we look at leg number two here sothis is the leg of the overall righttriangle this leg two is the geometricmean of the entire hypotenuse and thepart of the hypotenuse B that 's closestto that leg so I 'll show you in someexamples how you work with this so sayfor example this one here we have thatright triangle we drop the altitude wehave three triangles that are similar toone another okay and the leg here whichis X okay is our geometric mean sohere 's our geometric mean okay these arethe means of the entire hypotenuse whichis 9 and the part of the hypotenusethat 's closest to that leg so we wantfour we do n't want this length here sothat 's 4 we cross multiply we get xsquared equals 36 and if we take thesquare root we get 6 so that 's thelength of the leg of the overall righttriangle okay let 's go to the nextexample same thing we have a righttriangle we drop in altitude we getthree similar triangles and we can useour leg geometric mean theorem so thisleg Y okay is the geometric mean of theentire hypotenuse which here we 're goingto have to add these two pieces togethernine times the part of the hypotenusethat 's adjacent to that leg so that'ssix so if you cross multiply you get Ysquared equals 54 take the square rootof both sidesyou get three square root of six onceyou simplify that radical last exampleokay here they give us the leg is atethe entire hypotenuse is 10 and we'retrying to find this part that 's adjacentto this leg here so same idea we 've goteight is the leg that 's the geometricmean of the entire hypotenuse that 's 10and the part of the hypotenuse X that'sadjacent to that leg so you can see thisis 10 x equals 64divide both sides by 10 x equals 6.4 Leg Geometric Mean Theorem Leg Geometric Mean Theorem Leg Geometric Mean Theorem
