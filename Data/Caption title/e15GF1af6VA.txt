got right triangle dropping altitude hypotenuse right angle end three two overall triangle similar oneanother corresponding angle sare congruent sides going tobe proportional comes weve got two leg leg one geometric mean hypotenuse whole length times part hypotenuse thats adjacent leg thats close st leg mean extreme leg one geometric mean hypotenuse whole hypotenuse part hypotenuse thats close st leg look leg number two leg overall right triangle leg two geometric mean entire hypotenuse part hypotenuse b thats leg ill show work say example one right triangle drop altitude three triangle similar another leg x geometric mean geometric mean mean entire hypotenuse part hypotenuse thats close st leg want four dont want length thats cross multiply get x squared equal take square root get thats length leg overall right triangle let go next example thing right triangle drop altitude get three similar triangle use leg geometric mean theorem leg geometric mean entire hypotenuse going add two piece together nine times part hypotenuse thats adjacent leg thats six cross multiply get squared equal take square root sides get three square root six simplify radical last give us leg ate entire hypotenuse trying find part thats adjacent leg idea weve got eight leg thats geometric mean entire hypotenuse thats part hypotenuse x thats adjacent leg see x equal sides x equal leg geometric mean theorem leg geometric mean theorem leg geometric mean theorem leg geometric mean theorem leg geometric mean theorem leg geometric mean theorem leg geometric mean theorem leg geometric mean theorem leg geometric mean theorem leg geometric mean theorem leg geometric mean theorem leg geometric mean theorem leg geometric mean theorem
