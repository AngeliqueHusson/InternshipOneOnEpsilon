there are a couple of things we havelearned about operations on inequalitiesif we multiply or divide the inequalityby a negative number we flip theinequality sign and if we square aninequality of non-negative numbers thesign is not flippedif non positive numbers the sign isflipped and four numbers with oppositesignswe can not say what squaring does to theinequality in this session we look atthe reciprocal of the values on eachside of the inequality if we havesomething like X is equal to Y we can besure that one over x is equal to oneover Y if they are nonzero but what ifit 's an inequality like a is less than Bagain as we are not sure let 's try outdifferent cases first when both a and Bare positive something like 1 is lessthan 2 second when both are negativeminus 2 is less than minus 1 and thirdwhen the signs are opposite say minus 1is less than 2 now in each of these 3major cases let 's see what happens tothe inequality sign when we take thereciprocal of both the sides reciprocalof 1 is 1 and the reciprocal of 2 is 1/2clearly the inequality sign flips 1 isgreater than 1/2 so in the both numberspositive case taking the reciprocalflips the sign okay next case reciprocalof minus 2 is minus 1 over 2 and thereciprocal of minus 1 is minus 1 whathappens to the inequality sign it flipsagain minus 1 over 2 is greater thanminus 1 in both positive and bothnegative cases taking the reciprocalflips the inequality sign third case thereciprocal of minus 1 is minusone and that of two is 1/2 theinequality sign does not flip so aftertaking the reciprocal do n't flip theinequality sign if the numbers haveopposite signs what if there is a zeroin one of the sides something like zerois less than 2 or minus two is less thanzero the reciprocal of zero is undefinedso taking the reciprocals here will notgive us a definite answer forreciprocals if the signs are same weflip the inequality and if they aredifferent we do n't and we are talkingabout non zero cases we ca n't summarizethis for the reciprocal of nonzeronumbers on each side of the inequalityif the numbers have the same signs flipthe inequality and if they havedifferent signs we do n't flip theinequalityyou Operations on Inequalities (Reciprocal) ( GMAT / GRE / CAT / Bank PO / SSC CGL) Operations on Inequalities (Reciprocal) ( GMAT / GRE / CAT / Bank PO / SSC CGL) Operations on Inequalities (Reciprocal) ( GMAT / GRE / CAT / Bank PO / SSC CGL)
