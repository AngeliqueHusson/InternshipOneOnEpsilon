SIMON PAMPENA : It's mind blowing.I learned this when I was at uni , the existence oftranscendental numbers.And the name was a selling point.Because I was like , transcendental.You know , it 's a time when you 're really interested in , like , out of body experiences and whatnot.But the idea that mathematicians gave this nameto numbers , numbers , these are numbers thatyou 're familiar with.Like pi , you can write down as a decimal expansion.You 'll never get it right , but it 's just a number that you'refamiliar with.Has this property that we just did n't know about.OK , we 're going to play a game , and we 're going to tryand understand transcendental numbers with this game.The game is reducing down numbers to 0.That 's what you want to do.So the rules are you can only use whole numbers to do it , and you can add , take , multiply , and put the wholething to any power you like , but it has to be a wholenumber power.OK , so let 's play the game.OK , so do you have a favorite number ? BRADY HARAN : Well , I like the number 10.SIMON PAMPENA : 10 ? BRADY HARAN : Yeah , but that seems like quite an easy one.SIMON PAMPENA : Sure.That 's fine.You mean 10 in base 10 ? BRADY HARAN : 10 in base 10.SIMON PAMPENA : Yeah , OK.So 10 in base 10.OK , here we go.Let 's start the game.So we want to get this down to 0 , so the first thing we coulddo is multiply it by 0.But that you can do with any number , because any numbertimes 0 is -- BRADY HARAN : 0.SIMON PAMPENA : Bingo.You can do that , but that's not very interesting.But what is interesting is that if we try and use theserules , we can go , OK , what happens if I takeaway 10 from this ? We 're done.So there you go.So that sounds kind of trivial , but it 's a reallygood start.So we used a whole number , and we used the take.What about something else ? How about 3/4 ? First of all , let's multiply it by 4.OK , so these things will cancel.You get 3.Now we can take away 3 , we 'll get 0.Excellent.But what about something crazier ? What about like a really crazy number ? What about like , the square root of 2 ? I think you guys know about the square of 2.BRADY HARAN : Yes , we do.That 's irrational , is n't it ? SIMON PAMPENA : It 's an irrational number , andirrational means it ca n't be expressed as a fraction.So the square root of 2 is kind of a very strange number , and so this little thing here , I often say this little thinghere is like a little sentence.It says , what number multiplied by itself gives youthis number ? That 's the way I think of the square root sign.So I do n't know what number multiplied by itself gives me2 , but that does n't matter.Now , what we 'll do is to try and get thisone down to 0 , OK ? First of all , we 'll have to -- BRADY HARAN : OK , that , I reckon I can do that.SIMON PAMPENA : Well , tell me.BRADY HARAN : I reckon if we raise that to a power -- SIMON PAMPENA : Yep.What power ? BRADY HARAN : Let 's raise it to the power of 2 ? SIMON PAMPENA : Correct , so that'smultiplying it by itself.And then what do you get in the middle ? BRADY HARAN : You 're going to get 2 , I 'd bet.SIMON PAMPENA : That 's right.So now you 've got 2 in there , so what are you going to do ? BRADY HARAN : Subtract 2.SIMON PAMPENA : Yes ! So look at that.So you 've just taken an irrational number , and withthis game you 've brought it down to 0.How about the square root of negative 1 ? We 've gone from numbers that you know and love tofractions , OK , to irrational.This is irrational numbers.Now we 've gone into what they call complex , or some peoplecall imaginary , which is a terrible name for it.OK , so what can you do to this one here to try andget it down to 0 ? BRADY HARAN : Well , I 'm just going to square it and add 1.SIMON PAMPENA : There you go.No flies on you , mate.So there you go.So we 've been able to play this game with three or fourvery different types of numbers , quite special.But what about something else ? What about the square root of 2 plus the square root of 3 ? What can you do with that ? So , let 's see.The square root of 2 plus the square root of 3.Now we 're gon na square it.OK , so this is a little bit of high school maths.2 plus 2 times this by this , which is 2 the square root of2 times square root of 3 plus this squared.So that 's 3.So this reduces down to 5 plus 2 by the square root of 2 bythe square root of 3.OK , so this is what we 've done.We 've done that there , but look what 's popped out.A number that we can use , a whole number.So what we 'll do is on this side , we 'll go 5 plus 2 by thesquare root of 2 by the square root of 3 , and nowwe 'll take away 5.So we 'll end up getting 2 by the square root of 2 by thesquare root of 3.And this is good , because there 's noplus sign in the middle.What can we do next ? Well , we 're going to square all of that.So 2 squared is 4 , and the square root of 2 squared is 2.And the square root of 3 squared is 3.OK , so that dot is another way of saying times.And so that one is 2/8 , two 4 's are eight , eight 3 's 24 , done.So if we go 24 , take 24 , boom , we get down to 0.What I wanted to show you , the reason why I wanted to showyou this is because all these different numbers look verycomplicated , unrelated , but let me show you.Now , let 's replace all the numbers we put in with x.x take 10 is 0 , 4x take 3 is 0 , x squared take 2 is 0 , xsquared plus 1 is 0 , and this one is x squared take 5 , allsquared , take 24 equals 0 , which if weexpand out , so look.These all look like algebra problems.So what we did was in our game , we picked numbers , andwe tried to get them to 0.But the opposite could have been here , let 's solve for x.Now , this is the stuff that you get taught in school.This is algebra , and it so happens that the family thatall these numbers belong to , even the square root ofnegative 1 , is algebraic numbers.So we 've actually found a home for some of the biggest starsof maths , the numbers that have caused huge problems andschisms , what is the square root of negative 1 ? Square root of 2 from the ancient times , the Pythagorean times.People died because of this number.But somehow we 've found a family for these numbers , algebraic numbers.OK.So next , we 're going to need another sheet of paper.We 've chosen some numbers.What about a special number ? What about e ? Now this number here -- if you 're not familiar with it -- this number is afantastic number for maths.And what it is is that if it 's a function , a function of e tothe x , e to any number that you raise it to , OK ? On the graph , when you graph it like so , the y value isalso at the slope of the tangent at that point.So it 's really , really important to natural growth.It 's like a really fantastic number.It means a lot to life , really , but it 's actually asuper crazy number.Super , super crazy.One of the expressions I can show you for it is actually aninfinite sum.So I 'm going to blow you away.It 's 1 plus 1 on 1 plus 1 on 2 plus 1 on 6 plus 1 on 20 -- anyway , it keeps going forever and ever.But can we play the game with this number ? Can we bring this number down to 0 using therules of our game ? BRADY HARAN : Can we do it with algebra ? SIMON PAMPENA : Can we do it with algebra ? That 's right.BRADY HARAN : All right.Can we ? SIMON PAMPENA : Well , for ages and ages and ages , e 's beenaround for about 400 years.Nobody really knew.I mean , this number is really , reallyimportant , and no one knew.It so happens , we can't.BRADY HARAN : It ca n't be done.SIMON PAMPENA : It ca n't be done , and I 'll show you why.Well , I 'll kind of try and show you why , because it'sactually really tricky.But it was a guy called Charles Hermite , and hebasically showed -- right , so I 'm going to use these symbols here , because Ido n't know what the formula will be.He basically showed if you try and play the game , right , bringing e to any power that you want , whole power andtimesing it by any whole number.So if you claim that there does exist some bit of algebrathat you can bring it down to 0 , he showed that you 'll leadto a contradiction.Basically , he showed that there was a number , a wholenumber that existed between 0 and 1.Obviously , there 's not.Obviously , there 's not.But this is what you do in maths , is that if you want toshow you something is impossible , you kind of assumethat it 's true , and then you show that it creates acontradiction.So this is amazing.So this is what Hermite discovered , and this isreally , really a fantastic -- I mean , everyone should be excited by this , because e isnot algebraic.So what number is it ? Well , it somehow transcends what we 're capable of doing.The thing with algebra is that's how we build numbers.Like , that 's our world is built with algebra.Like , any number that you kind of deal with in your everydaylife has a lot to do with algebra.You 're just adding , taking , dividing , things to the power , but e is not.So it somehow transcends maths.So that 's what they called it . e is transcendental.It 's actually [ INAUDIBLE ] show you other than e.You know why , is because -- well , this is the interesting thing.e was n't the first transcendental number.They discovered a transcendental number , Liouville , I think his name is , discovered atranscendental number quite a long way before this , 30 yearsbefore this.But it was like , through construction.So he was actually trying to find a number based on therules of the game that did n't fit.What 's special is that e was already , it 's already asuperstar of maths , e.Like , people knew about it.So this was an extra piece of information.But then people asked this question.What about pi ? BRADY HARAN : Superstar.SIMON PAMPENA : The superstar.This is the superstar of math.2,000 years old.What is pi ? Is pi algebraic or transcendental ? So you 've got to imagine as a mathematician , OK , you love pi.Like , it comes with the territory.You can not not like pi.So this is the thing , is that you could actually add to theknowledge of pi.You could add something new , which is incredible.I mean , I would die a happy man if I could do that.So this question came up , what is pi ? Is it algebraic or transcendental ? And so it was about , probably 1880s that a guy calledLindemann actually came up with the answer.He showed , and again , this is a very tricky thing that heshowed , he showed e raised to any algebraic number istranscendental.So for example , e to the 1 , e.That 's a good thing , because e should be transcendental , because it 's already been proven.Because 1 is algebraic.Your favorite number , Brady , e to the 10.That 's transcendental , right ? e to the square root of 2 , e to the i.Right ? What about pi ? So how could you use this fact here , e to the a , so a is anyalgebraic number , is transcendental ? How can you use that fact to show that pi istranscendental ? OK , so this is the thing.Again , it 's a proof by contradiction.So , this is what he did.He said , let 's assume pi is algebraic.So pi is algebraic.That means there's a formula for it.OK , what 's that formula ? Who knows ? Because it does n't exist.But as an example , if you're an engineer , you 'd say , oh , yeah , pi , 22 on 7.All right ? OK , cool.So that means pi times 7 take 22 equals 0.Right ? As an example.That 's not true , by the way.There 's no way I 'm claiming that to be true.Do n't you dare cut it and say Simon thinks that 's true.It 's not true.Pi , 22 on 7.Pi , 22 on 7.I know pi to quite a few decimal places , and that'sobviously not true.And an actual fact , just so I can tell you , another reallynice approximation of pi is the cube root of 31.It 's actually pretty close.So that could be another formula.So that means if we cube that and take away31 , that equals 0.OK , so we 've got like these phony equations.This is the big kicker.This is the big kicker.We 're going to use another superstar equation , OK ? e to the i pi equals negative 1.So this is Euler 's identity.It 's a famous one , is n't it ? But look at it.Look what it says . e raised to the i pi is negative 1.Now , i pi , OK , if we assume pi is algebraic , that means i pimust be algebraic.So e to an algebraic number has to be transcendental.But is negative 1 transcendental ? It 's not , because we can play the game , and wecan get it to 0.So by using another increase piece of maths in yourformula , imagine this is like you 're making a film , likeyou 're doing a maths film , and you 've just got the biggestHollywood star in the world to start in it.In your proof.Starring in your proof.So this here , e to the i pi is negative 1.If indeed this was algebraic , this would have to betranscendental , so that means i pi can not be algebraic.And who 's the culprit ? Well , it 's not the square root of negative 1.It 's pi.So pi can not be algebraic , which means pi must betranscendental.So there 's something really tricky going on , and that'swhy I like it.Because the tricky stuff is where all theawesome maths is.In maths , perfection is important.But then , anyone who uses maths -- for physics or chemistry , or whatever you want to do -- then they can kind of use approximations.I 'm not interested in approximations .
