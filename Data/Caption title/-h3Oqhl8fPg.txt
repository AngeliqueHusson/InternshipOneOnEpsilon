We now have the general tools to really tackle anymultiplication problems.So in this video I 'm just going to do a ton of examples.So let 's start off with -- and I 'll start in yellow.Let 's start off with 32 times 18.Say 8 times 2 is 16.Well , I 'll do it in our head this time because you alwaysdo n't have all this space to work with.So 8 times 2 is 16.Put the 1 up there.8 times 3 is 24.24 plus 1 is 25.So 8 times 32 was 256.Now we 're going to have to multiply this 1 , which isreally a 10 , times 32.I 'll underline it with the orange.1 times 2 -- oh , we have to be very careful here.1 times 2 is 2.So you might say hey , let me stick a 2 down there.Remember , this is n't a 1.This is a 10 , so we have to stick a 0 thereto remember that.So 10 times 2 is 20.Or you say 1 times 2 is 2 , but you 're putting it in the 2'splace , so you still get 20.So 10 times 2 is 20.It works out.Then 1 times 3.And we have to be very careful.Let 's get rid of what we had from before.1 times 3 is 3.There 's nothing to add here , so you just get a 3.And so you get 10 times 32 is 320.This 1 right here , that 's a 10.10 plus 8 is 18.So now we just add up the two numbers.You add them up.6 plus 0 is 6.5 plus 2 is 7.2 plus 3 is 5.Let 's keep going.Let 's do 99 times 88.So a big number.8 times 9 is 72.Stick the 7 up there.And then you have 8 times 9 again.8 times 9 is 72 , but now you have the 7 up here.So 72 plus 7 is 79.Fair enough.Now we 're done with this.Let 's just delete it just so that we do n't get confusedin our next step.In our next we 're going to multiply this 8 now times 99.But this 8 is an 80.So let 's stick a 0 down there.8 times 9 is 72.Stick a 7 up there.Then 8 times 9 is 72.Plus 7 is 79.2 plus 0 is 2.Let me switch colors.9 plus 2 is 11.Carry the 1.1 plus 7 is 8.8 plus 9 is 17.Carry the 1.1 plus 7 is 8.8,712.Let 's keep going.Ca n't do enough of these.All right , 53 times 78.I think you 're getting the hang of it now.Let 's multiply 8 times 53 first.So 8 times 3 is 24.Stick the 2 up there.8 times 5 is 40.40 plus 2 is 42.Now we 're going to have to deal with that 7 rightthere , which is really a 70.So we got to remember to put the 0 there.7 times 3 , and let's get rid of this.Do n't want to get confused.7 times 3 is 21.Put the 1 there and put the 2 up here.7 times 5 is 35.Plus 2 is 37.Now we 're ready to add.4 plus 0 is 4.2 plus 1 is 3.4 plus 7 is 11.Carry the 1.1 plus 3 is 4.4,134.Let 's up the stakes a little bit.So let 's say I had 796 times 58.Let 's mix it up well.All right , so first we 're just going to multiply 8 times 796.And notice , I 've thrown in an extra digit up here.So 8 times 6 is 48.Put the 4 up there.8 times 9 is 72.Plus 4 is 76.And then 8 times 7 is 56.56 plus 7 is 63.I 'm sure I 'll make a careless mistake at somepoint in this video.And the goal for you is to identify if and when I do.All right , now we 're ready , so we can get rid ofthese guys up here.Now we can multiply this 5 , which is in the 10 's place.It 's really a 50.Times this up here.Because it 's a 50 we stick a 0 down there.5 times 6 is 30.Put the 0 there , put the 3 up there.5 times 9 is 45.Plus the 3 is 48.5 times 7 is 35.Plus 4 is 39.Now we 're ready to add.8 plus 0 is 8.6 plus 0 is 6.3 plus 8 is 11.1 plus 6 is 7.7 plus 9 is 16.And then 1 plus 3 is 4.So 796 times 58 is 46,168.And that sounds about right because 796 -- it 's almost 800.You know , which is almost 1,000.So if we multiplied 1,000 times 58 we 'd get 58,000.But we 're multiplying something a little bit smaller than 1,000times 58 , so we 're getting something a little bitsmaller than 58,000.So the number is in the correct ballpark.Now let 's do one more here where I 'm really goingto step up the stakes.Let 's do 523 times -- I 'm going to do a three-digit number now.Times 798.That 's a big three-digit number.But it 's the same exact process.And once you kind of see the pattern you say , hey , this'llapply to any number of digits times any number of digits.It 'll just start taking you a long time and your chances ofmaking a careless mistake are going to go up , butit 's the same idea.So we start with 8 times 523.8 times 3 is 24.Stick the 2 up there.Now 8 times 2 is 16.16 plus 2 is 18.Put the 1 up there.8 times 5 is 40.Plus 1 is 41.So 8 times 523 is 4,184.We 're not done.We have to multiply times the 90 and by the 700.So let 's do the 90 right there.So it 's a 90 , so we'll stick a 0 there.It 's not a 9.And let 's get rid of these guys right there.9 times 3 is 27.9 times 2 is 18.18 plus 2 is 20.And then we have 9 times 5 is 45.45 plus 2 is 47.I do n't want to write that thick.47.Let me make sure I did that one right , and let 's justreview it a little bit.9 times 3 was 27.We wrote the 7 down here and put the 2 up there.9 times 2 is 18.We added 2 to that , so we wrote 20.Wrote the 0 down there and the 2 up there.The 9 times 5 was 45.Plus 2 is 47.You really have to make sure you do n't make carelessmistakes with these.Then finally , we have to multiply the 7 , which isreally a 700 times 523.When it was just an 8 we just started multiplying here.When it was a 90 , when we were dealing with the 10'splace , we put a 0 there.Now that we 're dealing with something that 's in the100 's , we 're going to put two 0 's there.And so you have 7 -- and let's get rid of this stuff.That 'll just mess us up.7 times 3 is 21.Put the 1 there.Stick the 2 up there.7 times 2 is 14.14 plus our 2 is 16.Put the 1 up there.7 times 5 is 35.Plus 1 is 36.And now we 're ready to add.And hopefully we did n't make any careless mistakes.So 4 plus 0 plus 0.That 's easy.That 's 4.8 plus 7 plus 0.That 's 15.Carry the 1.1 plus 1 plus 1 is 3.4 plus 7 plus 6.That 's what 's ? 4 plus 6 is 10.It 's 17.And then we have 1 plus 4 is 5.5 plus 6 is 11.Carry the 1.1 plus 3 is 4.So 523 times 798 is 417,354.Now we can even check to make sure.And so this is the moment of truth.Let 's see if we have -- let 's see.523 times 798.There you go.Moment of truth.I do n't have to re-record this video.It 's 417,354.But we did it without the calculator , which isthe important point .
