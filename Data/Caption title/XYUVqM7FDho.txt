you can easily find the area of atriangle when given its base and heightbut what if you 're only given thelengths of its sides let 's say a B and Chow do we find the area of this trianglewe have a formula for it the area equalsthe square root of s times s minus atimes s minus B times s minus C a B andC are the length of the triangle butwhat on earth is s it is the semiperimeter of the triangle S will equal aplus B plus C by 2 that is the perimeterdivided by 2 or half the perimeterhere 's a typical problem that you maycome across in your exams we are given atriangle with lengths 5 12 and 13 unitsand are asked to find its area as we aregiven the length of all three sides wecan use the heron 's formula which islearnt and to use the heron 's formulathe first thing we need to find is thesemi perimeter of this triangle it willbe 5 plus 12 plus 13 divided by 2 thatwill be 30 by 2 which equals 15 15 isthe semi perimeter of this triangle sowhat will be the area it will be thesquare root of Sammy perimeter which is15 times semi-perimeter minus 5 timessemi-perimeter minus 12 timessemi-perimeter minus 13 it will be thesquare root of 15 times 10 times 3 times2 writing this in terms of its primefactors gives us this expression solvingit further we get its area as 30 squaredunits that 's how we can use the heron'sformula to find the area of a trianglebut wait look at the numbers again dothey ring a bell 5 12 and 13 form aPythagorean triple which in turn tellsus that this should be a right triangle13 beinglargest site will be the hypotenuse andthis will be the right angle so tell medid we really have to do all this notreally we could just use the 1/2 basetimes height formula and get the answeras 30 square units I ca n't say it enoughin your competitive exams time is ofutmost importancegetting the correct answer matters yesbut how quickly you arrive at it is whatmakes the differenceyou test
