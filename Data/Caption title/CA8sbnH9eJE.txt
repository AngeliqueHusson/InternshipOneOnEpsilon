get welcome take bath channel gon na look video gon na looking simplify third look know couple thing first third favorite mathematical topi cive fact remember school actually really cent try make simple possible remember actually school expression simplify ing always thought strange expression always little bit simple didnt sort thing go certain basically expressed exactly root power square root two type calculator would give answer say one point four one want give whole string thing never hit pattern never become recurring seemingly random string decimal sand never end thing known irrational number reason use syrt exact way express particular value looking bigger way basically information multiply search multiply third rule throw particular rule two going explain know works havent seen ear lier video multiply thats able catch rule multiplying third follow square root expression times square root number square root times b thats nice simple sort ill explain works non certain times square root times square root square root square root multiply get right square root square root modify equal square root see times said rule work k hopefully pretty comfortable rule face get get get comfortable well use actually simplify thank third expression first gon na three say square root use use gon na help us get perfect square ill show mean say thats really worth actually quick list squint squared squared squared forth use help us simplify gon na use rule idea help us simplify ked math try simplify theyre theyre trying get get lo west possible serge hear might number times lost possible number way far ill show step first want literally look factor one goes goes equal square root times square root petite rule say case hope say good could simplify square root going square root look simpler hey look doesnt look much simpler always grant ked ked simplify k hopefully pretty good let give another one pretty good take bit guesswork know obviously two say gon na get work square root ask simplify one thing either side yeah find factor might look list go theres going find go times goes twice doesnt three different actually oh thats perfect square could one choose one one equal square root times square root give us still possible sir yeah make sense simplify square root multiplying square root thats simple expression get keep ill give one example remember ill honest went school yes think let say go another example say want actually go find simplification know answer couple example square root whatever worth going list go well else goes go knowing doesnt go go yeah goes three times yeah doesnt gon na make one gon na choose equal square root number times get work square root square root gon na put times square root thats simplified answer pretty good give slight variation might get kind would think would bit ruby soft didnt k might also get sort actually use get actually say working simplification say something like square root treat much start find factor goes gon na fact gon na equal square root times square root k probably could written little bit fact fine five times square root four times square root three youve really done put find fun equal five times square root four two times square root three actually take bit multiply one square root three theres answer feel feel k hopefully feel really good simplify ing bad look agree dont feel like kind answer like problem unto ked thats ked hopefully thats little little bit easier anyway thanks watching well see next time simplify ing square root simplify ing square root simplify ing square root simplify ing square root simplify ing square root simplify ing square root simplify ing square root simplify ing square root simplify ing square root simplify ing square root simplify ing square root simplify ing square root simplify ing square root simplify ing square root simplify ing square root simplify ing square root simplify ing square root simplify ing square root simplify ing square root simplify ing square root simplify ing square root simplify ing square root simplify ing square root simplify ing square root simplify ing square root simplify ing square root simplify ing square root simplify ing square root simplify ing square root simplify ing square root simplify ing square root simplify ing square root simplify ing square root simplify ing square root simplify ing square root simplify ing square root
