find probability rolling double dice let think think fraction us getting want roll let make little table give us first dice first die say let call first die second die second die different possible going tobe going get outcome could geta get second die might gotten first die might gotten first die could get second die draw grid draw grid let best draw quick grid draw really fast let draw grid right cell grid box grid would represent outcome possible finish drawing go get understanding mean represent outcome cell right would represent getting first die second die thats outcome one potential outcome snow many total well could look area right area going times possible possible outcome sand make sense think first die theres outcome sand second die times think grid cell satisfy entail us getting well could get get first die get die get first die get die get first die get die think see many involve us getting double well theres someone ask whats probability getting probability getting double rolled dice going equal number give us double going equal total number possible made sure kind understood look possible outcome sand satisfy theres probability rolling another way could thought know let roll first die going number right first die going number order double second die exact number right dont care first die could could could dont know rolled first die order second die roll might almost simultaneous second die roll matter sand whatever number first die theres chance second die going thats another way reasoning chance first die anything want theres chance second die going thing first die either way get answer event event event event event event event event event event event event event event event event event event event event event event event event event event event event event event event event event event event event event event event event event event event event event event event event event event event event event event event event event event event event event event event event event event event
