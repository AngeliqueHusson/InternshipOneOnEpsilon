Find the probability of rolling doubles on twosix-sided dice , numbered from 1 to 6.So let 's just think about it.Let 's think about all of the outcomes , all of the possibleoutcomes , and then what fraction of those outcomesrepresent us getting doubles.We want to roll doubles.So let 's make a little table here that 'll give us all ofour outcomes.You have 6 outcomes on the first dice , or the first die Ishould say.So 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6.So let 's call this the first die.And then the second die , there are 6 outcomes.So 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6.This is the second die.So all of the different possible outcomes are going tobe some -- you 're going to get an outcome -- so you could geta 3 over here.And then when you get a 3 on the second die , you might havegotten a 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , or 6 on the first die.Or you might have gotten a 5 on the first die and then youcould get a 1 , 2 3 , 4 , 5 , or 6 on the second die.So if I draw a grid here.If I were to draw a grid here , let me do my best to draw aquick grid.Just draw it really fast . So let me just draw this gridright here.Each cell of this grid , each box in this grid , wouldrepresent an outcome.All of the possible outcomes.Let me finish drawing it.So there you go.And so just to get an understanding of what I meanby it represents an outcome.This cell right here would represent getting a 4 on yourfirst die and a 2 on your second die.That 's the outcome it represents.It 's one of the potential outcomes.Now how many total outcomes are there ? Well you could look at the area of this right here.The area of this is going to be 6 times 6.You have 36 possible outcomes.So 36 possible outcomes.And it makes sense.You can think about the first die.There 's 6 outcomes.And then for each of those 6 outcomes , you have 6 possibleoutcomes for the second die.So 6 times 6.Or you can think of in this grid , it hasexactly 36 cells in it.Now what are the outcomes that satisfy our conditions ? That entail us getting doubles ? What are the outcomes there ? Well we could get a 1.If we get a 1 on the first die , we have to get a 1 on thesecond die.If we get a 2 on the first die , we have to get a 2 on thesecond die.If we get a 3 on the first die , we have to get a 3 on thesecond die.I think you see where this is going.4 and 4.5 and 5.And then 6 and 6.So how many of these outcomes involve us getting double ? Well , it 's 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 outcomes.So there 's 6 outcomes with doubles.So if someone asks you , what 's theprobability of getting doubles ? The probability of getting doubles when you rolled twosix-sided dice , numbered from 1 to 6.It 's going to be equal to the number of outcomes that giveus doubles -- so it 's going to be equal to 6 -- over thenumber of the total number of possible outcomes.Over 36.And 6 over 36 is 1/6.Now I made sure that you kind of understood that look , theseare all the possible outcomes.And 6 of them satisfy.So 6 of the 36.So there 's a 1/6 probability of rolling doubles.But another way you could have thought about it is , you knowwhat , let 's just roll the first die.It 's going to have some number on it , right ? The first die is going to have some number on it.Now in order for me to have doubles , the second die has tohave that same exact number on it , right ? So I do n't care what the first die is.It could be a 3 , it could be a 4 , it could be a 5.I do n't know what that is.But after I 've rolled that first die , in order to getdoubles , what the second die roll is -- they might be almostsimultaneous -- but what the second die rolls matters.And so whatever number I have on the first die , there 's a1/6 chance that the second die is going to have that samenumber on it.So that 's another way of reasoning thatyou have a 1/6 chance.The first die does anything it wants , but there 's only a 1 in6 chance that the second die is going to have the samething as the first die.Either way , you get to the same 1/6 answer . test
