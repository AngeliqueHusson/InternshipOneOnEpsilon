welcome presentation imaginary let start definition equal square root negative view another way could say equal negative special well knew learned number square equal positive number right negative times negative positive n write positive every time equal positive times positive think square root number far learned taking square root make sense us notion asquare root negative number n really exist done set definition number n variable actual number value equal square root negative wo n go philosophical whether number imaginary exist maybe make another presentation exist enough useful leave also hint well wo n go whole e negative blow mind wo n go think whether really exist also think whether anything really long let get back equal square root negative squared equal negative let think implication say well first power like anything else equal right squared already said definition squared equal negative third power well would equal squared times right squared negative would negative times equal negative fourth would equal third times exponent rule well third negative times right third negative kept well negative times well thing negative times right times well definition times squared equal negative equal negative times negative equal clean little bit actually let start zero zero power well know anything zero power equal keep still equal first power equal squared definition equal negative third power sho wed equal negative make sense thats squared times fourth power fifth power well equal fourth power times right write fourth times fourth equal right equal times equal see pattern zero power equal negative power equal squared equal negative third power equal negative fourth equal fourth equal zero one power equal fifth think find zero could n believe zero equal fourth equal eighth equal twelfth think see pattern multiple equal first equal fifth equal ninth equal thirteenth equal iso power multiple plus right equal plus nine equal plus could similar pattern squared equal toi sixth equal tenth equal negative finally third equal seventh equal eleventh equal negative iso useful see cycle four pattern look use determine power ask hundredth power well could work could say well thats equal times ninety ninth far use cycle see hundred multiple right times hundredth fall category first one multiple know hundredth power equal said hundred one power thats going equal right equal plus put category equal multiple multiple multiple plus hundred second power similarly would equal negative hundred third power would equal negative hope understand defined square root negative kept multiplying figure said zero equal first equal squared equal negative third equal negative fourth equal pattern repeated used pattern able figure power even high number simple way think three hundred twenty three say divide remainder well know goes right times know divide goes remainder right remainder care number actually cal led modulus maybe another module modulus important actually computer since know divide exponent remainder say thing third weve learned negative similarly said five hundred second power well know divisible right times remainder divide could say thing squared learned definition negative ask thirty seven know divisible remainder would equal hopefully give indication might first time dealing number thats imaginary teaching cycle property might want review video could try module essentially keep working type problem hope fun bye imaginary imaginary imaginary imaginary imaginary imaginary imaginary imaginary imaginary imaginary imaginary imaginary imaginary imaginary imaginary imaginary imaginary imaginary imaginary imaginary imaginary imaginary imaginary imaginary imaginary imaginary imaginary imaginary imaginary imaginary imaginary imaginary imaginary imaginary imaginary imaginary imaginary imaginary imaginary imaginary imaginary imaginary imaginary imaginary imaginary imaginary imaginary imaginary imaginary imaginary imaginary imaginary imaginary imaginary imaginary imaginary imaginary imaginary imaginary imaginary imaginary
