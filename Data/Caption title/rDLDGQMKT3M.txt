Welcome to the presentation on i and imaginary numbers.So let me just start out with a definition.i is equal to the square root of negative 1.Or to view it another way , you could say that i squaredis equal to negative 1.Now why is this special ? Well , we knew or we 've learned that any number when yousquare it is equal to a positive number , right ? If I had negative 1 times negative 1 , thatequals positive 1.You do n't have to write the positive every time but thatequal positive 1 and so does 1 times 1 , thatequals positive 1.So if we think about the square root of a number , so far allwe 've learned is taking the square roots of positivenumbers , and that makes sense to us because the notion of asquare root of a negative number did n't reallyexist until now.So what we 've done is we 've set this definition that the numberi , and i is n't a variable , it 's an actual number.It 's value is equal to the square root of negative 1.Now I wo n't go into all of the philosophical musings aboutwhether i , as a number i , or any imaginary numbersactually exist.Maybe I 'll make another presentation on that.But they exist enough to be very useful to manyengineers and physicists.So I 'll leave you with that , and I 'll also just hint at -- well , I wo n't go into the whole e to the i piequals negative 1.But that blows my mind , but I wo n't go into that.And when you think about whether i really exists , youshould also think about whether anything really exists.So , I 've diversed for too long , so let 's get back to what I wassaying before . i is equal to the square root ofnegative 1 , and i squared equals negative 1.So let 's think about the implications of this.If I were to say -- well , i to the first power , just likeanything else , is equal to itself , right ? i squared , I 've already said using this definition , isquared is equal to negative 1.i to the third power , well that would just equal isquared times i , right ? And i squared is negative 1 , so it would be negative 1 times i.And that just equals negative i.And i to the fourth would equal i to the third times i.I 'm just using my exponent rules here.Well i to the third is negative i times i , right ? i to thethird is negative i , and then we just kept that i.Well what 's negative i times i ? Well that 's the same thing as negative 1 timesi times i , right ? And what 's i times i ? Well , the definition.i times i , i squared , is equal to negative 1.So that equals negative 1 times negative 1 , which equals 1.Interesting.Let me clean this up a little bit.Actually let me start with i to the zero power.i to the zero power , well we know anything to the zeropower is equal to 1.So we 'll keep that -- that still equals 1.i to the first power is equal to i.i squared by definition is equal to negative 1.i to the third power , I just showed you , is equal tonegative i , and that makes sense because that'sjust i squared times i.And i to the fourth power equaled 1 again.If I did i to the fifth power , well that 's just equal to i tothe fourth power times i , right ? I 'll write that down , i to the fourth times i.i to the fourth is equal to 1 , right ? This is equal to 1 , so 1 times i is equal to i.Do you see a pattern here ? i to the zero power equals 1.i to the negative 1 power equals i.i squared is equal to negative 1.i to the third power equals negative i.i the fourth equals 1 again.So i to the fourth equals i to zero , and i to the one poweris equal to i to the fifth.I think you 'll find out that i to the zero , and you could trythis out if you do n't believe me , i to the zero is equal to ito the fourth , which equals i to the eighth , which equals ito the twelfth , I think you see the pattern.Any multiple of 4 equals 1.And i to the first equals i to the fifth , equals i to theninth equals i to the thirteenth , equals i.So that 's i to any power that is a multipleof 4 plus 1 , right ? Because 5 is equal to 4 plus 1 , nine is equal to 8 plus 1.And we could do a similar pattern . i squared is equal toi to the sixth , equals i to the tenth , and so on , andthat equals negative 1.And finally i to the third is equal to i to the seventh , which equals i to the eleventh , and so on , equals negative i.So why is this useful ? We see a pattern.It 's a cycle of four.In this pattern , if we look at this , we can usethis to determine what i to any power is.So if I were to ask you what i to the hundredth power is , well , you could just work it out , you could say , well that'sjust equal to i times i to the ninety-ninth andso far so down.But if we use the cycle , we see that hundred isa multiple of 4 , right ? 4 times 25 is 100.So i to the hundredth will fall into this category , this first one.It 's a multiple of 4.So we know that i to the hundredth power is equal to 1.Similarly , if I said i to the hundred and one power , that'sgoing to equal i , right ? Because that equals 100 plus 1.So it puts you into this category.Equal to a multiple of 4 , 100 is a multiple of 4 , and 101is a multiple of 4 plus 1.i to the hundred and second power , similarly wouldequal negative 1.i to the hundred and third power would equal negative i.I hope you understand what I'm doing here , and all I did is Idefined i as the square root of negative 1 , and then Ikept multiplying i to figure out a pattern.I said i to the zero equals 1 , i to the first equals i , isquared equals negative 1 , i to the third equals negative i , and i to the fourth equals 1 again.And the pattern repeated itself.And then I used that pattern to be able to figure out i to anypower , even it 's a very high number.So a very simple way to think about it is if I had i to thethree hundred and twenty three.What I do is I say if I were to divide 4 into 323 , what 's the remainder ? Well , I know 4 goes into 320 , right ? 4 times 80 is 320.So I know that when I divide 4 into 323 , so 4 goes into 323 80times with a remainder of 3 , right ? And the remainder is what we care about.And this number is actually called a modulus.Maybe I 'll do another module on modulus -- it 's very importantactually in computer programming.But since we know that when you divide this exponent by 4 theremainder is 3 , we can say that this is the same thing as i tothe third , which we've learned is negative i.Similarly , if I said i to the five hundred and secondpower , well I know 500 is divisible by 4 , right ? 4 times 125 is 500.So the remainder is 2 if I were divide it by 4.So I could say that this is the same thing as i squared.And i squared we learned by definition is negative 1.If I were to ask you i to the thirty-seven ? We know 36 was divisible by 4 , so the remainder is 1.So it would be i to the 1 , which equals i.Hopefully that gives you an indication of what i is.It might have been confusing the first time because we'redealing with a number that's '' imaginary , '' and I 'm teachingthe cycle property of it.What you might want to do is review the video again , butthen after that you could just try the module on i , whichessentially just keeps working you through thistype of problem.I hope you have fun.Bye . i and Imaginary numbers i and Imaginary numbers i and Imaginary numbers
