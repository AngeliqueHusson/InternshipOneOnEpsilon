welcome to my second video onsimplifying radicals here in thisexample we have the fourth root of 80 Xto the fifth times y cubed and in mylast video when we were simplifying cuberoots we factored and we tried to findgroups of three and we 're going to usethe same idea for this example as wellbut since we have a fourth root we'regoing to try to find groups of four sothis will make a lot more sense once weget started let 's start by factoring theinside of this fourth root and I 'm goingto give myself as much space as possibleand let 's start off with this number 80I 'm going to factor this ad as much aspossible until we have all prime numbersso we know that ad is an even number soyou can it 's divisible by two so 80 isequal to two times forty and forty canbe factored that even further so I'mgoing to erase this 40 and rewrite it astwo times 20 so 40 is equal to two times20 and a 20 can be factored even furtherso I 'm going to erase the 20 and rewriteit as two times ten and I 'm going tocontinue this process with the 10 theten can be rewritten as two times fiveso I 'm going to erase the ten andrewrite that as two times five so now wehave completely factored the number 80with all prime numbers and we haven'tchanged a thing we have 2 times 2 whichis 4 4 times 2 which is 8 8 times 2which is 16 16 times 5 is 80 which iswhat we started with so we still haven'tchanged anything so now let 's move on toour X to the fifth term X to the fifthis just X multiplied by itself fivetimes so we have one two three four fiveX 's and we can do the same exact thingwith our Y term our Y cubed is just Ymultiplied by itselfthree times so we have one two threewise so now we have completely factoredthe inside of our radical and once againsince we have a fourth root we want tofind groups of four and notice how wehave a group of four twos here on theleft and we also have a group of fourX 's here in the middle and that 's it wehave no other groups of four and theidea is we want to separate all of thesegroups of four so let 's start with thisgroup of twos I 'm going to separate thisgroup of four twos so we have the fourthroot of one two three four twos and nowI 'm going to do the same thing with ourgroup of X 's so we have the fourth rootof one two three four X 's and in ourlast radical we need to put everythingthat we have that 's left over so noticehow we have a five left over on theinside so we need to put a five on theinside of our roots notice how we alsohave a X that 's left over on the insideso we need to put an X on the inside ofthe radical and notice how we have threeY 's that are left over on the inside sowe also need to put three Y 's on theinside of a de chol so what we just didin this step is just the basic propertyof radicals if you 're multiplying on theinside of the root you can separate themas long as you continue to multiply andat this point I 'm the only thing we haveleft to do is just simplify this for oursolution so if we start with these fourtwos the fourth root of 4 2 s is just 2the fourth root of 4 X 's is just X andour last radical ca n't be simplifiedmuch we have a 5 on the left and we haveour X and instead of writing Y threeseparate times you can just say Yso this is the solution to our problem2x x the fourth root of 5x times y cubedso I hope this gave you a better idea onsimplifying radicals I 'm going to bemaking many more videos in the future sostay tuned I really hope that you areenjoying these and I will see you in mynext one test
