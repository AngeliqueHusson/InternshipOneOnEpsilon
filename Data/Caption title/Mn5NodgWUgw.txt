so here we 're going to find the area ofa square in the formula that we use is ais equal to s squared and the a standsfor area and the S stands for the lengthof any side of the square because ifit 's a square then all the sides havethe exact same length and you can alsouse the formula for the area of arectangle where the area is equal to thebase times the height and we 're going todo an example and use both theseformulas and we 'll see that we 'll getthe exact same answer both times solet 's start with our first formula hereon the Left where a is equal to thelength of a side squared and notice howthe bottom side of the square has alength of 4 which means that all sidesof the square have a length of 4 so my sis equal to 4 units so I 'm going to plugin a 4 for s so instead of having aequals s squared now we have a equals 4squared and 4 squared is exactly thesame as 4 times 4 and if we multiply 4times 4 we know that our area is equalto 16 and never forget to put in yourunits remember that area is always insquare units however since our originalsquare the side with the length of 4does n't have any units so that 's why Ileft out my units for my area so nowlet 's do the same exact problem usingthe formula for the area of a rectanglea equals the base times the heightnotice how the base of our square whichis the bottom side has a length of 4 butremember how all sides of a square haveequal length so if the bottom side has alength of 4 then the left side certainlyhas a length of 4 so now we have a basewith the length of 4 which is the bottomside and now we have a height which isjust the length of the left side alsowith the length of 4 so let 's plug thesevalues into our formulathey equals the base times the heightI 'm going to plug in a 4 for my base andalso for for my height so now we havethe formula the area is equal to 4 times4 and if we multiply those together wehave the area is equal to 16 squareunits and notice how our answer of 16square units is exactly the same usingboth formulas area of a square area of a square area of a square
