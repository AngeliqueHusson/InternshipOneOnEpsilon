ED COPELAND : Hello.BRADY HARAN : I was going to ask you to describe this interms that you would describe it to , say , your daughter.And then I remembered your daughter doeseconomics at Cambridge.ED COPELAND : Yeah.BRADY HARAN : So let's not do that.Let 's describe this as you should describe to me , maybe.TONY PADILLA : OK , so there's been a very excitingbreakthrough in the field of number theory.It caused an awful lot of excitement amongst themathematicians , as excited as mathematicians can get.And the crazy thing about it is that it 's come fromsomebody who 's pretty much unknown.It 's a guy called Yitang Zhang , which isa pretty cool name.And he does work at the University of New Hampshire.ED COPELAND : It 's about prime numbers , the things thatcertainly got me into maths.TONY PADILLA : In fact , he really struggled to get anacademic job.He worked for a time in Subway.ED COPELAND : There are some amazing properties of primes.And they 've led to lots of conjectures that have n't yetbeen proven.TONY PADILLA : There 's nothing wrong with working in Subway.But normally , these breakthroughs are achieved bythose that are working at Princeton , Harvard , thesekinds of really elite places.And now we 've got somebody who's literally come out ofnowhere , that no one expected to produce this kind of resultand has done something really impressive that many greatminds were unable to do.ED COPELAND : But one in particular does n't involvemultiplication of primes.It involves additions of primes.And it 's the fact that there seem to be an endless seriesof primes which differ by 2.So the obvious ones are the low number primes , so 3 and 5 , and 5 and 7 , 11 and 13.TONY PADILLA : So these two prime numbers are called twinprimes and are called twins because they differby this number 2.ED COPELAND : And then there's a conjecture that goes backhundreds of years , which says , actually , there 's an infinitenumber of these.So the highest known pair is a remarkable , right ? 3,756,801,695,685 times 2 to the power of 666,689 plus 1 isthe higher of the pairs of primes.And if I take away 1 , it gives me the lower ofthe pairs of primes.BRADY HARAN : That 's epic.ED COPELAND : It 's an epic.Just to remind you , the lower ones that we were describingwere 3 and 5 , and 5 and 7 , et cetera.So to be able to do that and show that that 's a pair ofprimes that differ by 2 is remarkable.TONY PADILLA : So these ones that differ by 2 are calledtwin primes.You also get , of course , ones that differ by 4.These are called cousin primes.And there 's even those that differ by 6.And these are called sexy primes , which I think you'vedone as well.Why ca n't you have prime number that differ by 7 ? BRADY HARAN : You ca n't have prime numbers that differ by 7because one of them will be an even number.TONY PADILLA : Exactly , Brady.Well done.So we know that there definitely are an infinitenumber of prime numbers.And I can prove that for you if you want.BRADY HARAN : We 've done that.TONY PADILLA : You've done that.I thought you had.OK , so you know that there 's an infinitenumber of prime numbers.What people are n't sure about is that there are an infinitenumber of prime numbers that differ by 2.But it 's believed to be true.ED COPELAND : And so the goal is to try and show this.And it 's never been shown.But what has been shown , for the first time , is that youcan bound the difference between two primes.And somebody has shown -- in fact , Yitang Zhang , from theUniversity of New Hampshire , has shown that there is abound between two primes , let's say one prime a andanother prime b.And that bound is that it can be some number N. And so if Nwould be 2 , for the case that we 're interested in here -- andthat 's the ultimate case that people are interested in.But what he 's managed to show is there is some number N forwhich for an infinite number of primes , a and b , this isgoing to be less than or equal to 70 million.BRADY HARAN : So just to be clear , two primes can beseparated by more than 70 million ? ED COPELAND : Oh yes , yes , yes , they can.But what he 's shown is that -- and in fact , the conjecture isthat every single even number , there is an infinite number ofprimes that can be separated by that amount.So here , the even number is 2 , right ? So the conjecture is there 's an infinite number of pairs ofprimes which are separated by 2.But there 's also a conjecture that there 's an infinitenumber of pairs of primes separated by 4 , and aninfinite number separated by 6 , and 8 , andin fact , up to infinity.So that all the even numbers , the conjectures are there arean infinite number of primes separated by that amount.But no one has been able to show that 's true of anynumber up to now.And what he has demonstrated is there are an infinitenumber of primes which will be separated by a number N whichhe has n't yet calculated , but he knows that it 's less than70 million.TONY PADILLA : There 're an infinity of these guys . [ PHONE RINGING ] TONY PADILLA : Oh , god.BRADY HARAN : What ? Take two.TONY PADILLA : Hello.Hi , babe.I 'm in the middle of doing a video.Well , I 've got to answer it so it stops ringing.All right , call you back when we 're done.All right , see you in a bit.BRADY HARAN : Was that Ed ? TONY PADILLA : No , it was -- ED COPELAND : The mathematicians who work onprime numbers will now , no doubt , be scouring over whathe has done and trying to knock this number down.I mean , I was already hearing about one of the key peopleinvolved , a guy called Goldston , who 's talked aboutit might be immediately possible to knock thisdown to about 16.And that 's a lot closer to 2 than 70 million.But of course , he has a very nice way ofdescribing this value.Maybe 70 million means the primes are not twins , butthey 're certainly siblings.TONY PADILLA : But why is it amazing , Ithink , is more the point.Why is it really incredible ? Well , there 's a sort of nice way to illustrate this.One thing we know is that obviously , there are aninfinite number of prime numbers.But the gaps between the prime numbers , generically , getbigger and bigger and bigger.In fact , you know that for the first N -- for prime numbers between 0 and N , the average gap is oforder log of N. It 's a function , but this is a bignumber , is the point.It 's not as big as N , but it 's a big number.OK , so let me illustrate what that means in practice.So imagine you had a scenario where you 've got a world withall the numbers.And there 's some rule -- and I 'm just going to impose this rule because I 'm king ofthis world -- that says that prime numbers can only fall in love withother prime numbers.OK , so the idea is that you go on dates withyour nearest neighbors.And do you fall in love or not ? So for the prime numbers at the lower end of the numberspectrum , they 've got it made.3 gets it down with 5.7 's getting it on with 11.They do n't have to go very far before theyfind their true love.But when you get up to , say , googolplex , in principle , onaverage , you expect to go on of order a googol dates beforeyou 're likely to find your true love.Because the prime numbers are so far apart at thatlarge end of things.So it 's a pretty loveless place at that end of things.So you get to bigger and bigger numbers , you mightthink there 's just no way you 're going tofind your true love.And you probably wo n't even bother going out of thehouse.You 'd just stay in and watchJeremy Kyle or something.But what is actually true , though , what Zhang has shownus , is that for some lucky prime numbers at that veryhigh end of things , they actually -- and it 's always the case -- there are some that actuallywill only have to go on about 70 million dates before theyfind their true love.So there are always some prime numbers which are relativelyclose together.BRADY HARAN : 70 million seems such an arbitrary number.ED COPELAND : Yeah.BRADY HARAN : And it 's like , if it 's possible to explain , howhas that fallen out of this proof ? ED COPELAND : 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6.TONY PADILLA : OK , so when people do number theory , howdo they actually go about doing these proofs ? They tend to use sieve theory .
