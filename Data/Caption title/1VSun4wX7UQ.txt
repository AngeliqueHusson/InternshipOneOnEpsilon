What is a line ? It is basically a thin straight markmade by a pencil or a markerand it extends indefinitely in both directions.But I can also draw a line like this or like this.It means that we do not have a single way in which a line can be drawn.We just draw a part of a line.Lines are generally named with lowercase letters.This can be called line ' p ' , or we can draw a line like this and mark two points ' A and B'.This will be called line 'AB'.Line 'AB ' can also be written as 'AB ' with a tiny line drawn over 'AB'.So what is a ray ? A ray starts at one point and goes on indefinitely in one direction.Just like for lines even rays can be drawn in different ways.What we draw is just a part of a ray.We can mark this point as ' A ' , and mark a point ' B ' somewhere on the ray ! We can call this ray 'AB'.Or write 'AB ' with a tiny ray over it.This tells us that the ray starts at point ' A'.and goes indefinitely in one direction.It 's a bit ironical.But the point at which the rate begins is called the end point of the Ray.Here , ' A ' is the end point of this ray ! Which means it can not be written as ray 'BA'.Or 'BA ' with a tiny ray over it.But line 'AB ' can also be written as line 'BA'.We just need to be careful when we are dealing with a ray.Now let 's get to the final concept in this video.Look at what we have drawn here.We can see that it has two end points.This is called a line segment , and it is a fixed part of a line.This is its specified length , and it does not extend indefinitely in any direction.If the end points are ' A ' and ' B ' . This can be called line segment 'AB'.Or it can also be written as 'AB ' with a line segment over it.And yes , we can also write this as 'BA ' with a line segment over it.A line extends indefinitely in both directions.A ray starts at its end point .And goes indefinitely in one direction .And a line segment is a fixed part of a line . test
