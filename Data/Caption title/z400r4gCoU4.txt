all right in this example we 're going tosketch the graph of the ellipse ysquared over 4 plus X minus 5 squaredequals 1 so what we 'll do is basicallywe 're going to find the center and we'regoing to find some the vertices and alsothe co vertices and we 'll just make arough sketch based on that so we couldwrite this as Y minus 0 quantity squaredwe can write 4 as 2 squared then we haveX minus 5 squared we could put that over1 but again we could even just write 1as well 1 squared and again I 'm justputting this you know in the standardform of an ellipse so the center of ourellipse is going to be positive 5 comma0 so we can now read that off from ourstandard form and to get the verticeswell I 'm even going to go ahead andstart making a rough little sketch basedon this and point out some other thingsas well so 1 2 3 4 5 so there 's going tobe the center the center of our ellipsenow to get the vertices we can basicallylook at our a value and our B valueagain a is greater than B so in thiscase our a value is going to equalpositive 2 so the way I always againjust kind of thought about things so I'mgoing to go in to put 5 0 there okay thenumber that 's being squared is 2 againthat 's our a value and you know that'sunderneath the y squared term the termthat involves Y squared that tells mehow many units we go up and down fromour Center so I 'm going to go up 1 2units and then I 'm going to go down 1 2units and those will give us thevertices of our ellipse so we 've got 5comma 2 and then our other point isgoing to be here at 5 comma negative 2well likewise if we look at our beefyou are B value is going to equalpositive one and that tells me how far Imove left and right from where it'scentered to get my co vertices so fromthe center it says move left one unitokay and then it says move right oneunit as well so the co vertices will beat 4 comma 0 and also at 6 comma 0 andnow again I 'm just going to make a roughlittle sketch of my ellipse and notquite to scale but not too terrible soall right so again that 's what I like todo I pick out the center and then againI look at my a value or my B value andagain if it 's underneath a you know Ilook at the I look at the numerator thatkind of tells me again hey that 's howmany units I either go up or down andagain for example if you look underneaththe term involving X the B values 1 wellX I think about the x-axis that 's kindof to the left and to the right so thathelps me remember sort of what directionto go to get my other points test
