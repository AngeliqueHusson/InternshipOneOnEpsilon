right example going sketch graph ellipse squared plus x minus basically going find center going find vertices also c vertices make sketch based could write minus quantity squared write squared minus squared could put could even write well squared know standard form ellipse center ellipse going positive read standard form get vertices well even going go ahead start making rough little sketch point well going tobe center center ellipse get vertices basically look value b value greater b case value going equal positive way always kind thought thing go put squared value know thats underneath squared term term involve squared tell many go center going go going go give us vertices ellipse got point going comma negative likewise look beef b value going equal positive one tell far move left right centered get c vertices center say move left one say move right one unit well c vertices beat comma also comma going make rough little sketch ellipse quite scale terrible right like pick center look value b value underneath know look look numerator kind tell hey many either go example look underneath term x b value well x think x axis kind left right remember sort direction go get point conic section ellipse sketch graph given equation conic section ellipse sketch graph given equation conic section ellipse sketch graph given equation conic section ellipse sketch graph given equation conic section ellipse sketch graph given equation conic section ellipse sketch graph given equation
