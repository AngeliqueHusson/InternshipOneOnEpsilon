today going talk block chain technology give high level overview emerge bit coin white paper thats really start guess de fining technology distributed decentralize system entire record view transaction took place decentralize distributed network draw explain decentralize distributed network actually classic centralize network central node network connect distributed system might links something bit like know node line lose part data system distributed system like network something bit like think talking bit like data base data base sharded distributed component part across network distributed decentralize complete record data base system combined together add one single data base individual node complete copy transaction case youve got youve got decentralize network youve got cluster connect ing individual cluster sand lattice pattern youve got distributed decentralize network think block chain system distributed ledger like old data base term transaction based fundamentally store ledger also immutable say set transaction added cant know something added block change core underpin hash hash tree public private key sort common parlance bit coin known bit coin wallet thats actually public key term private public key cryptography like ear lier public private encryption essentially case block chain wallet public key private key interesting thing least way bit coin block chain technology nothing total wealth current wallet spent transaction got bit coin technology want send one send one coin four back sort circular transaction basically say one bit coin sent dont necessarily know dont know theres reason us met even know name really saying wallet public key person corresponding private key public take ownership one thats public private key encryption used mean transaction said said spend amount wish transfer amount know turns got originate somebody else network poking thing hash merk el tree basically please throw another interesting thing way work given input make input put hash ing algorithm get output dont know five b change marginally say add add completely change corresponding ha shed code change input small way get drastically different hash code coming uniform length particular one despite fact input different length think like label ing u going use unique carefully cause occasion hash collision different input resolve hash aiming toward uniqueness idea think like fixed length signature given input feature block chain block chain technology transaction tal ked grouped get know think transaction network exist ing ether job might hear sort block chain technology job miner gather bunch two transaction together form block process involve process check ing block remains immutable goes tree drawn next diagram essentially one key formed block block corresponding tree come start abasic block content want represent tree structure generating next node tree going use h represent hash function b value comes label node take hash band c top level take hash hash b hash b cand next level tree interesting thing structure hash code remember diagram change input tiny bit change output change base content make lower case rather upper case example change hash code become invalid wi c persuade filter back core block chain technology term block u hin distributed system one know anybody elsehow know certain transaction everyone see chain block shaving tal ked underlying data example transaction get grouped block block get grouped think know ledger transaction transaction first formed network could go ether sort need grouped together block sin network anyone take role miner job grab ether put block draw block block several thing ha sa set transaction sa said something b b said something c also hash value previous block network going back tree structure additionally something known nonce value randomly value impact signature hash block hash combination record transaction hash value previous block nonce value generate code uniquely reason behind nonce value sort hash puzzle final hash code help know start four miner group transaction together put random guess es nonce value hash value criteria whatever hash puzzle hash puzzle come said part mathematics block chain network way block agreed upon key way distributed nature network anyone collection transaction light sort open yet formed block try create block theres sort mathematical race sort compute power solve puzzle first person solve first group people solve theyre generate block goes chain way fact everybody free try create block add chain happen say two people happen solve block moment precisely moment rare happen get fork block chain people network see one block added go try top block whereas people see different block added go try continue chain another across network everyone single agreed upon ledger happen longer essentially sort democracy throughout network longe st chain one everyone take mathematics unlikely long period know people looking time update current ledger longe st chain know suppose keep simple five people network forked chain two imagine two chain five seen know longer two vet bit contention submissively bishop majority vote going reject chain shorter longe st chain majority people network seen happen transaction happen shortage man know shorter chain thats kind group luck go extent go back ether theyre allure incorporated block chain process legitimate actually slow assistance moment well take happening quickly moment block use bit coin tweak first system know one widely adopted bit coin system lock mathematical complexity hash puzzle sliding scale reflect compute power network given point blot average every minute chain particular blockage less likely came plan shorter fork decided current waiting period counting money fix plot moment back hour instantaneous long wait point make slim chance going go back ether know incorporated block later unfortunate circumstance past shorter fork block chain transaction accepted turned back ether wasting another minor come along grab series transaction try build another block must leave insult film ing fact going pointer lonely bit coin go maybe thats correct yes like mining stop complicated change sort introduce show mining process financially warded think point time creation block merit wallet minor commonly case people grouping computer together group people made sort mining point longer gain financially mining regard gain transaction fee sand people give certain amount trank action want send get bit coin got five county ahead rather back maybe three half back k give half minor way financially complicated work mining bit like currency exchange pay pal little taste fee dirty nose dislike distribution effectively actually like well extent know transaction page moment know big part network people still getting money computation work curing hash system evolve upon transaction yes book role play within network theyre still likely far original conception theyll ever intended designed million existence clearly like radioactive release going thats reflected level reward mining every kitty bin book collection area produced reward mining block aft show half amount ecological network previously chi anti forth eventually million introduce network process key get hello back end thats nice simple works sort way
