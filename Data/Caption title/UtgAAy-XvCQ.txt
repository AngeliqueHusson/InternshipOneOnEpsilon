so the first thing you want to know isthat one degree is equivalent to 16minutes so that 's what this little markhere represents and then one minute isequivalent to 60 seconds and that 's whatthese two marks here represent secondsso you can think of a degree kind oflike an hour there 's 60 minutes in anhour and then there 's 60 seconds in aminuteso there 's 3,600 seconds in one hour andagain remember just think about hours aslike degrees so in this example we'regoing to convert from 4 degrees 50minutes 12 seconds to just degrees okayso here 's what we 're gon na do let 's takethe 50 minutes first and you can seethat for every 1 degree there are 60minutes anything divided by 1 is itselfso I 'm putting 50 over 1 and what youcan see happens here is that the minutesunits they cancel each other out see anumerator and denominator and we 're leftwith the degree units which is what wewant so if we go ahead and multiplyacross here we get this is 50 60th of adegree and let 's go ahead and convertthat into a decimal form here so let'sjust see 50/60 comes out to 0.8 3 3 3repeating right so this is 0.8 3 3 3 nowif we look at the seconds to 12 secondslet 's go down here we know that thereare let 's see there are 4 every 60seconds there is 1 minute right and wealso know that for every 60 minutesthere are one degree okay and the waywe 've set this up is so that the unitswe do n't want see the seconds theycancel numerator and denominator andsame thing with the minutes those unitscancel we do n't want those so theycancel a numerator denominator and we'releft with degrees which is the unit thatwe do want so you can see if we multiplyacross you multiply all the numeratorswe get 12 all the denominators we get3600 and if we divide those let 's seewhat we get in decimal form so we get 12divided by 3600 which comes out to Ohpoint zero zero three three threerepeating so zero zero three three likesalt so if we add this up we 've got thefour degrees okay point zero zero zerozeroand we 've got the minutes it wasconverted degrees the second converteddegree so if we add straight down youcan see this is going to be four pointeight three six six and so on degrees sothat 's it so that 's all you have to dois think about these conversion factorssixty minutes for every one degree 60seconds for every one minute and thenset it up so that the units you don'twant cancel and you can converteverything into just degrees so I wantto thank my patreon for supporting themaking of this video if you'reinterested in supporting me making morevideos like this for you check out mypatreon page consider making a donationof a $ 1 or $ 3 whatever is comfortablefor you to help the making of thesevideos and subscribe to the channelcheck out more math videos on Mario'smath tutor and YouTube channel and I'llsee you in the future videos I 'll talkto you soon test
