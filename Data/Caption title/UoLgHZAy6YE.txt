hey there Anthony here from mashup mathand thank you for joining me on thislesson where we are going to visuallyexplore a question based on theeighth-grade math standards let 's goahead and check it out hey everyonewelcome back you know it 's always coolwhen you get to apply your geometryskills to the real world so let 's goahead and do that right now in thisscenario we have a parking cone with aradius of 6.2 inches and a height of 18point three inches and our challenge isto find the volume to the nearest cubicinch of this cone now whenever we'retrying to solve a geometry problem wewant to create a diagram if those twothings pretty much go hand in hand sofor our diagram we have a cone and weknow that the radius of that cone on thecircle of the base is six point two andwe also know that the height is eighteenpoint three and this information isgoing to prove useful to us and weshould know that when we want to findsomething like volume of athree-dimensional figure we always haveformulas that will help us so for thisproblem we go into our geometry toolbelt and we pull out the formula forfinding the volume of a cone which is Vequals PI R squared times one third ofthe height and all we have to do now isplug in the information and then we cansolve now we know that R the radius issix point two and we know that H theheight is 18 point three so we cansubstitute those two values into theformula now remember that there 's a lotof multiplication going on here in thisformula we have pi times 6 point 2squared times 18 point 3 over 3 so youmay want to use parentheses when yousubstitute these values in now from herewe just have to simplify and evaluatenow 6 point 2 squared is equal to 38point 4 for 18 point 3 divided by 3 isjust 6 point 1 and our final product isgoing to be 736 with a long never-endingdecimal it 's an irrational number andremember that we wanted to express thevolume to thenearest tenth of a cubic inch so we haveto round our answer here now we can dothat by looking at the value to theright of the tenth decimal place so tothe right of the sixth in the thousandthdecimal place that value happens to be afive and we know when that value is fiveor greater we have to round up and ourfinal answer is seven hundred and thirtysix point seven cubic inches the volumeof the cone cool and that 's it for thatone I hope you guys enjoyed it pleaseclick the link below and subscribe toour YouTube channel we got a ton of ademented math lessons and I know you canlearn more than one topic in your mathclass and you 're gon na need help againso do n't forget to subscribe to support test
