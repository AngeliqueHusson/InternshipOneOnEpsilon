G'Day , I 'm James from the Global Math Project.Last October a global phenomenon occurred.It was our inaugural Global Math Weekand it was amazing because over 1.7 million students and teachersfrom about 170 different countries and territoriestook part in a shared common experience over mathematics.Joyous , beautiful , human , meaningful , relevant mathematics.It was the story of exploding dots.Teachers and students all across this planet during that weektook their first encounter on this piece of mathematics and talked about it togetherand shared that experience together on social mediaand it became a global phenomenon.And do you know what ? It 's been growing ever since.For the last six months , it has gone from 1.7 million students and teachers across our fabulous planetto about 4.6 million students.And by popular demand , we 're going to do it again this coming October.October 10th of this year is our second Global Math Weekwith the story of exploding dots.It is so joyous , so uplifting , people want exploding dots again and here they are.Let 's see arithmetic the way you 've never seen it before.True , deep , meaningful understanding.Let 's see how arithmetic is actually a story of polynomial algebra in high school work.Do n't stick with polynomials , go to infinite work.Why not ? Let 's go to pre-calculus and so forth.Play with really weird numbers , 0.999 going on forever.How about nines going the other way as well.Mind blowing.Base one and a half.This is getting to weird territory.Let 's go into some unsolved research mathematics.Or go back to grade school arithmetic and do fractions.Understand the story of place value in the ways you 've never seen beforeand push it to heights you 've never been before.The wonders , the magic , the beauty , the joy , the uplifting experienceof exploding dots is coming back again this coming October.We try to reach 10 million students and teachers across this planet.We can do it , be part of it.Take part in the joy.Go to our website www.globalmathproject.org.Learn what exploding dot are.Everything 's actually available right now.See what you 're in for , enjoy it , love it right now and then share itand have your students share it come October 10th this coming year.Beautiful.So let 's have a second global phenomenon.The story of mathematics.Curriculum , relevant , beautiful , human , meaningful mathematics.Let 's share it with the world.It 's been such a moving experience for me actually I have to say.Everything has been volunteer and grassroots.This has really been done by the power of our beautiful teachers all across the planetactually embracing the joy of mathematics and sharing it with their students.Very touching , it 's actually wonderful.Let 's do it again.Mathematics is fundamentally human.Mathematics is fundamentally joyful.Please , take part in the joy this coming October . test
