everything youyougood morning Adam defeat Delta polydenominator today we 'll be talking abouthow to add fractions that are alike andsome that are not alikelet 's go to our sally board and see whatparallel land has in store for us todaywelcome to parallel that by addingfractions I have a basket filled withapples and oranges if I take out twoapples and then I take out one more howmany apples do I have Diffie threeapplesof course now let 's say I take oneorange and another orange how manyoranges do I have two oranges now let'ssay I take out two apples and one orangePolly how many apples do I have - howmany oranges one right how many uhplunges who I have I do n't think that'sa word apprentice that 's not a wordeither/or angles nopeso let 's see what 's happening here if Iadd an apple - an apple I get moreapples if I add an orange and an orangeI get oranges if I add an apple to anorange I get an apple and an orangesince they are different fruits theydo n't combine we do n't get a new fruitsame thing applies in math we can onlyadd like things that makes a God itmakes sense I 'm hungry now we 'll extendthis concept of fractions fractionsare n't so bad you just have to rememberone key thing you can only add thingsthat are alike now let 's dividesomething into parts and see how thesame idea applies to fractions let'sdivide this strip into five equal partstogether these five parts make up thewhole strip so one part out of the fivewould be written as 1 over 5 wesay 1/5 if I take two of the five Iwould have 2/5 perfect now let 's take afew of these pieces in Adam what whatdid you call on me no I said Adam notAdam Ohbut since you 're clearly payingattention let me ask you a questionif I take two of these fits and addanother one how many do I have threethree what three of those pieces what isthe value of each piece 1/5 so three ofthem would becan anybody help Adam 3/5 yes let 's tryanother oneAdam what is 2/5 plus 2/5 is it 4/5 doeseveryone agree yeah mm-hmm mm-hmmyeah yeah good let 's try one morewhat is 2/5 plus 3/5 5/5 but wait isn'tthat just the whole thinggood observation so 5 out of 5 is onewhole thing right now let 's take note ofa couple of things when adding likethings fifths in this case we have thetops together and keep the bottoms thesame the correct terminology for the topand the bottom is the numerator anddenominator also if we have the samething over the same thing like we alwaysget one the number one is a very specialproperty that when it 's multiplied byany number we get back that same numberfor example 3 times 1 is 3 10 times 1 is10 1/3 times 1 is 1/3 now let 's workwith fractions that do not have the samedenominator let 's add 1/4 and 1/3 anyideascan we add the tops and bottoms and get2/7 let 's see what would happenwe 'll take 1/4 and 1/3 and put themtogether let 's compare this month withthe seventh do we get 2/7 no no no noteven close so it does n't look like wecan add the tops and the bottoms didn'tyou say we could only add like thingsyes what does that mean for this problemyou ca n't add fourths in thirds sothere 's no answer right no there is ananswer we have to be clever about itthough somehow we need to make the fortsand the thirds into the same things whatis the smallestnumber that three and four divided intowith no remainder twelve good sincethree and four will divide into 12evenly we should use twelve as our likething we 're going to need to multiplyeach fraction by something to get twelvein the denominators we could multiplythe first fraction by four and thesecond one by threethat 's almost correct we ca n't just goaround multiplying things by three andfour we would change their valuesremember that we can multiply any numberby one without changing it that means weneed to multiply these fractions bysomething in the form of one that getsus to 12 let me introduce you to afriend of mine who can help us with thisnoid you write class this is the numberone in disguise know it for surehi Lloyd number one in disguise would Igive what I can dogah cool note is going to help us addthese fractions we 've already determinedthat we need 12 to make 1/3 into a 12 weneed to multiply it by one know it canyou help us sheriffing yay so then 1/3times 4/4 is 4/12 right can you help uswith 1/4 nowso what is 312 good let 's put it alltogether nowanyone 7:24 no it 's 712 why because ifyou add 12 you get 12 you do n't getsomething like twenty-fourths could havesaid it better myselfcan we try another one I 'm not sure Iget it yet of coursewhy do n't you give me two fractions toadd 127 over three hundred seventeenplus how about I give you two fractionsto add will use 1/8 and 3/4let 's Adam what are all these thingsalike they 're fractionsyes they 're fractions are they likefractionsno one is 1/8 and the other one is 1/4let 's make them alike Delta what is thesmallest number that both 8 and 4 gointo um four not quite it does n't divideinto 4 4 is less than 8 since 4 dividesinto 8 would n't it be the answer verygood so does everyone agree that weshould rewrite these fractions as eightoh yeah annoyed ha what kind of oneshould I be now let 's look at 1/8 firstDiffie what do we need to multiply thedenominator by to get aids is n't italready in 8 we do n't need to doanything to itright what about 3/4 4 times 2 is 8 sowe need to multiply by 2 but remember wejust ca n't multiply a number by 2 thatchanges it we need to multiply it by 1 anumber 1 in disguisenumber 1 in disguise would look what Ican do yay so what do we have now 6/8good let 's put it all together now 1/8plus 3/4 is the same as 1/8 plus 6which is 7/8 he got it right good jobAdam nice job Adam does anyone have anyquestions before we leave for the day Ithink I got it I think I got it let'sthink know it for being here todaythanks thanks all right bye kids see yousoonwhereoh man I 'm sorry me huh do n't use yourreal voice try something elseoh no I ca n't talk right nowI 'm busy working I 'll call you later byecome on it 's a tie Episode 1 Adding Fractions Episode 1 Adding Fractions Episode 1 Adding Fractions
