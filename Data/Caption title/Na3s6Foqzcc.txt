video going go fly kite mean going introduce four sided figure quadrilateral two pair consecutive sides congruent yet opposite sides congruent shape kite know go wind fun four sided figure quadrilateral wrap around go consecutively wrap around quadrilateral two sides right arent congruent two tick mark one continue wrap around find pair pair pair two pair consecutive sides congruent add little extra dont opposite sides congruent well well would talking rhombus kite theres lot basic structure kite sure book going introduce later kind give us one theorem start going example sand going bring kind quietly used text without dont think really clarify ing enough going us diagonal kite going perpendicular diagonal connect ing two vertices formed noncongruent sides diagonal going way diagonal going perpendicular theyre going perpendicular theres going bisection going diagonal vertices included noncongruent sides actually would diagonal diagonal vertices included noncongruent sides diagonal vertices included congruent trying write math included mean formed diagonal connect ing vertices formed two sides congruent diagonal connect ing vertices formed consecutive congruent sides thats trying say going include two column end video particular property going proof also going couple think three algebraic example working sides angle kite sin video last two column proof going prove two segment congruent first going get sorry interruption yes diagonal going get going prove later congruent also see though kind recall old concept theorem stuff remember point point equidistant another segment point perpendicular bisector going use property leave maybe text book class yeah point thats equidistant another segment point perpendicular bisector opposite angle included formed noncongruent sides going congruent kite one diagonal drawn though going proof ill quickly talk mean look diagonal drawn would able say short proof triangle triangle congruent due side side reflexive property third side two triangle congruent due two angle would corresponding part congruent triangle congruent angle formed noncongruent sides included noncongruent sides always going congruent kite diagonal vertices included congruent sides formed congruent sides diagonal going bisect opposite angle say angle congruent angle proof said two triangle congruent two angle going going congruent due corresponding part mean use different color two angle going congruent make diagonal bisector angle reason two angle going congruent due corresponding part congruent triangle congruent yes diagonal connect goes angle formed congruent going bisect opposite quite nice meaning come good question working finding measurement missing angle missing sides right going three example remember three got kite kite couple diagonal want find measure marked value information giving us course kite one two pair congruent sides angle right angle degree sand going use find measurement angle well measure angle straightforward long remember diagonal kite intersect perpendicular fashion measure angle equal degree let turn attention let say angle looking triangle triangle course interior sum triangle equal degree within triangle got degree angle degree angle whatever left measure angle must make three angle inside triangle add measure angle going equal degree minus angle another minus taking degree whatever left final answer minus going degree degree left taking away first minus equal minus equal measure angle know measure angle degree know measure angle remember angle formed congruent pair angle congruent set sides angle ad c angle diagonal whatever measure angle measure angle measure angle also equal measure angle well dont work figure either remember let see theres couple ways approach think going remind two triangle remember ing course diagonal intersect perpendicular fashion triangle ade triangle c de going right triangle right triangle theyre also congruent right triangle si prove triangle congruent triangle angle corresponding angle angle marked degree measure angle also equal degree sand kind like verbally tal ked little proof right reflexive property e congruent mean hypotenuse leg two right triangle congruent corresponding part congruent triangle congruent another little tidbit example stress beginning geometry especially use two column proof building logic course give opportunity reinforce memorization theorem concept postulate definition giving still solve problem seven though writing two column proof well got going kite looking measure angle ways think want look entire kite kite quadrilateral right got four sides know sum interior angle polygon equal number sides minus times n four sides four minus times degree four angle going add degree might angle angle two different unknown cant make one equation solve right bat remember angle congruent one tal ked previous window mean angle unknown value think going let x angle angle measure kite going plus times x plus taken one two three four taking four angle one two additional two make four want make sure add like term left hand side going add sides undo addition weve got divide sides x excuse going divide sides get x alone x equal degree want make sure right make sure plus plus equal degree good go going look agreement excellent last example going look kite much complicated scenario first giving exact angle want solve forlet say well solve x actually could say solve x going actually know measure well able solve problem well find measure missing well unknown value swell angle formed consecutive noncongruent going equal side side side show two triangle congruent corresponding part congruent triangle congruent weve got equal minus going solve x going bring like avoid negative dont mind x right hand side equal add sides get equal x equal going run room going pause video real going take value going plug expression actually fill times minus times degree sand plug back get degree well going erase going fill two angle information theyre degree sand finish example last example kite kite original name know told b congruent ad b c congruent actually could given information draw diagram want prove diagonal connect vertices congruent sides included bisect diagonal also proof theres proof book perpendicular bisector didnt want exact proof already textbook see pretty simple one want recall knowledge learned congruent triangle sand corresponding part congruent triangle couple times video already well rein fore old concept well new talk two diagonal perpendicular bisector perpendicular bisector theorem point equal distance segment perpendicular bisector say perpendicular bisector c perpendicular bisector thus perpendicular bisector blah blah blah going state property gave first thing said diagonal perpendicular said diagonal one thats going prove fact diagonal perpendicular going show b well going show proving e mid point congruent e going focus ing either side going focus two triangle ce triangle show two say ce band show two triangle going corresponding part congruent triangle show two segment congruent proof going done kind verbally us go pretty quickly weve already stated b c congruent c say two blue triangle e c two triangle congruent going able say two two right triangle going congruent due theorem couple letter name abbreviation something hypotenuse something something let get reflexive property information marked two triangle going congruent perpendicular angle going skip step saying thats specifically degree angle thats right angle right triangle due fact perpendicular kind proof little bit show two right triangle congruent pair congruent leg pair congruent hypotenuse soh said thats congruent e corresponding part congruent triangle sand know therefore congruent due mean taken segment b cut two equal part thats simply definition segment bisector thats end proof r homework nan nan nan nan nan
