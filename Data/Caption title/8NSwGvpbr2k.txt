okay now what I 'm going to do is I'mgoing to walk you through what you needto be able to work out a whole series ofareas okay I 'm going to give you sixformulas of this see it 's two of themthe two trickier ones the two readerones are on your formula and data sheetwhich leaves behind that you need toactually remember now thankfully they'rethe four that are really quitestraightforward but what 's important tome in this lesson is not that you seeyou know what the equations are and knowthat they 're right but that theequations the form is actually feelright to you that you get a vibe for ahit 's not just a random jumble of lettersand numbers like say yeah okay that makesenseso here 's where we 're gon na begin thefirst diagram we 're gon na draw arectangle so when you have a rectanglethat 's a strong one here sorry when youhave a rectangle right I 'm really needtwo legs in a rectangle and we tend tocall them and okay I 've labeled as aright angle so it 's writing by the wayyou know how what makes a rectanglerectangle is that it 's got um rightangles everywhere that in fact isexactly what rectangle means for exampleif you say like a to you there 's apicture on the wall and it 's kind ofwonky and you say can you rectify thatfor me what you mean is can you make itright okayor if there 's an arrow making like it'sliterally that 's where we get the wordfrom right so rectangle means writingokay um now what do I do if I want towork out the area of this shape if Iknow the breadth and the height I justmultiply that 's it so remember I saidthere are four to remember true they gethanded to you well this is one and it'spretty easy and you were all able torecall it just like that okay next oneis a parallelogram so again let 's draw adiagram and let 's make sure it 's leaningover so you can really tell it 's aparallelogramyeah sorry I 'll fix it just give yousomething I mean it 's okay no it'sbecause I was n't standing straight ontothe whiteboard when I did it that 's whyokay now what am I do he is will bereally really helpful if you have excuseme you can see I 'm using a couple ofcolumns here I 'm gon na use a third onein a second now on a parallelogram wealso have a B and an H but they refer tosomething slightly different said the Bwe usually call this face I mean itlooks like it 's in the same spot butrecording in a base rather than just howit isbecause if I if I asked you how broadthat 's what breadth leaders come what isthis parallelogram you 'd probably go allthe way from here to there if there'snot actually what I want and I just wantthis side okay H also stands forsomething different so instead of justlike one of the sides you actually needto add in a perpendicular line right sothis height er it 's actually anabbreviation for the perpendicularheight right it 's like measured in aright angle that 's how tall the thing isit 's just convenient that because arectangle has writing it everywhere thehi it 's just over yet but in aparallelogramyou 're not the case okay so why don'twhat you see now it 's time to get you onthe Colorado is if you do a slight legalrearrangement here this parallelogram Iwant to try and change it so it lookslike a rectangle okay so what I 'm gonnado is I 'm gon na slice off this littletriangle bit key okay if I slice thatbit off remembering that what makes aparallelogram a parallelogram is theseparallel sides I should be able to grabthis part here they 're trying toI should be able to grab it cut it offand move it over to the right it 's timeto pair them in there what is okay nowif I 've done that right and this is allright angles and all that jazz thenhaving lost the red triangle for a manand put it over here this shape now isjust a rectangle just like before so infact the formula for the area of aparallelogram is exactly the same rightwhen when you know it when you know thathere they 're lengths of these sidesright here the important thing is this His not a side it 's like it 's like theleaning over side it 's gon na be howprovinces all right sirI said there one remember two of themare identical so this is not so hardthe next one is you want to give me asuggestion okay now we 'll get to atrapeze new treaty it 's actually one ofthe trickier ones I want to I want asimpler shape what 's a simple shape Istill have n't got on his okay so I canthink about the square but this is justa kind of rectangle so I 'm lining it upI think I heard someone say trianglesnow let 's draw a triangle and trying tomake it too nice and neat like as younot like perfect an isosceles triangleor something like thathere 's my triangle and just like withthe parallelogram I 'm gon na put a baseand a perpendicular height one so I'mgonna call this bottom edge the baseyeah it 's a lot of salt and what'sreally cool it 's about time you got soabout did you hear about how what 's thatcountry if you put all those solarpanels in the Sahara DesertWow nice breeze now you know who reallyknows Han Solo um four people in thisclass Germans they really know that'shere in fact I 've got a friend and he'sgoing into photovoltaics he 's anengineer and I 'm he 's moving to Germanybecause all of the legit stuff in solaris happinessin fact I think they have so muchrenewable energy one day recently theyhad to pay their citizens to use powerbecause they had so much been generatedby anyway yeah yeah it 's amazingwhy do n't we have that Australian feltlike really possible okay now where werewe I put a base on I will show you thisperpendicularly so I can have aperpendicular height okay now then thequestion becomes well how do I ignorelike some of you may well be able toquote may be able to quite the format inwhich is great but if you remember Isaid to you I want more than just foryou to know the formulasI 'm gon na say right I want you to feelthat they make sense okay so here 's whatI 'm gon na doagain you ca n't I want to relate thetriangle to the shapes I already knowabout okay so what I 'm gon na do is takethis triangle and I 'm going to encase itin a rectangle so I 'm going to drawaround it like this okay so you can seeI put a box around my triangle okay nowwhat 's great about this box is thatbecause of the way I brought us it hasthe same bread for the base of thebreadth of the same it has the sameheight it 's all looks just like this onein fact the dimensions embracing me toowhat 's brilliant about this is and I'msorry if you want site to run out ofcolors now line up this will make itcool I 've never got not one triangle butin fact because of all the lines I'vegot I have four trainers for trianglesright watch see about this left-handpart of my original triangle but do younotice that that pilot triangle exactlymatches to this park here can you seethat like they 're literally that wherethe fancy where we use is congruent okayso those two triangles are comingthey 're the same size okayin exactly the same way you look at theright hand side and this triangle hereit also has a twin right this part onthe outside that I added by making onlythe rectangle yeahso now tell me what 's the area of therectangle I think it 's it spread muchhigher okay so that 's why this is notjust some magical coincidence it'sbecause the way we work out trends isit 's exactly half of a rectangle is itmaking sense for you right test
