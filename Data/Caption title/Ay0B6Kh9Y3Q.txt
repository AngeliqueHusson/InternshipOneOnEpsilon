We 're asked to simplify 9p to the 2/3 , all of thatover the square root of 4p cubed.So let 's just do this step by step.The first thing we can do is say , well , if it 's 9p to the 2/3 , that's the same thing as 9 to the 2/3,9 to the 2/3 times p to the 2/3.That 's what this top part can be simplified to.Now the bottom part , we can rewrite the bottom partright here.The square root of 4p to the third.And this is the exact same thing as 4pto the third to the one half power.This is the same thing.The square root of 4p to the thirdis the same thing as 4p to the third to the 1/2 power.So given that , we can do the same thing that wedid on the numerator , we can say , well , this is the same thing as 4 to the 1/2.4 to the 1/2 times p to the third to the 1/2 timesp to the third to the 1/2 power.Let 's see if we can simplify this even more.So this is going to be equal to -- let'sdo the denominator first here.So what 's 4 to the 1/2 power ? What 's the principal root of 4 ? Well , 2 squared is 4.So it 's 2.The positive root is 2 , and then p to the third , and then thatto the 1/2.That 's the same thing as p to 3 times 1/2 , or p to the 3/2.p to the 3 over 2.9 to the 2/3.See , the cube root of 9 is n't anything easy.Well , actually , you could think about it this way.You could say it 's 9 squared.So we can view nine to 2/3.Let me do it this way.This is the best way to think about it.This is 9 to the 2/3.One could write it.I 'm kind of making it unsimplified.But it will help us calculate what it actually means.9 to the 2/3 , the same thing as 9squared , 9 squared to the 1/3 power , right , because 2 times 1/3 third is 2/3.And you have that , of course , times p to the 2/3.And this is going to be equal to 9 squared is 81.So it 's 81 to the 1/3 power times p to the 2/3.Times p to the 2/3.Now instead of writing this 2 and this p to the 3/2down here , Let me just write it as negative exponents.Or even , let 's try to just write it like this.But 2 in the denominator is the same thing as 1to the negative 1 , or 1/2.So this right here , if I want to writenumerator , same thing as 1/2.That and that are the same thing.And p to the 3/2 in the denominatoris the same thing as p to the negative , p to the negative 3/2.So this whole expression so far hasbeen simplified to this right over here.And let copy and paste.I 'll work on the next line now.So let me copy it , and paste.Bring it down right over there.Let 's see if we can simplify this even more.So let 's think about 81.Let 's see if we can write it as -- we 're essentially , when we take something to cubed , wetake the cube root of something , we'retaking something to the 1/3 power.Taking the cube root of it.So we have to find some numbers , or maybe we could factor itinto things that do have cube roots , and other things that don't.So 81 is divisible by 3.It 's 3 times 27 , which is 3 times 9 , which is 3 times 3.So 81 is 3 to the fourth power , or 3 multiplied by itselfthree times.So we could rewrite this 81 to the 1/3.we could rewrite it as 3 times 3 times 3 to the -- well , I 'll write it like this.Times 3 to the 1/3.That 's the same thing as 81.And then let 's think about this these p's.And I 'm doing more steps than I would do if I were doing iton a piece of paper , because I really want y'all to understandkind of what 's going on here.So we have a p to the 2/3 , times p to the negative 3/2.So that 's going to be times p to the 2/3 , 2/3 minus 3/2 power.And then so we did the p 's , and thenwe just have the times 1/2.Times 1/2.Now this right over here , this is the same thing.This is the same thing as , we could justdo this as 3 times 3 times 3 , times 3.So it 's the same thing as 3 times 3 times 3 to the 1/3 , times 3 to the 1/3.We 've done this multiple times.Times the 2/3 minus 3/2.Let 's just work that out.Actually , three halves is a larger number , so let 's just say it 's the negative of 3/2 minus 2/3 , which is equal to the negative if we use 6as a common denominator.If we use 6 as a common denominator,3/2 with 6 in the denominator , is 9/6 6 minus 4over six that 's what 2/3 is equal to.So 9 minus 4 is 5/6 , but then we have this negative value.So it equals negative 5/6.So times p to the negative 5/6 power , times 1/2 times that last 1/2 over here.Now 3 times 3 times 3 , or 27 to the 1/3 , the cube root of 27 , is 3.So this right here simplifies to three.And then 3 to the 1/3 , that 's the cube root of 3.So we could say , 3 and then this righthere is the cube root of 3.The cube root of 3.So we get 3 times the cube root of 3 , times p to the negative 5/6.So sometimes you might want to write the p out herein front of the radical.That tends to be a simpler way.Actually , let me do that.So I 'll write the p to the negative 5/6 , pto the negative 5/6 , then I 'll write the radical.So times the cube root of 3.And then all that times 1/2.or we could say all of that multiplying by 1/2 , or just divide it by two.And we 've simplified it about as far as you can go.You could view it as 3/2.You could say 3/2 is 1.5p to the negative 5/6 times the cuberoot of 3.If you wanted to , you could calculate the cube root of 3 , multiply that times 1/2 , give you some decimal number timesp to the negative 5/6.And that 's about as simplified as this thing I can get .
