f fun could n count many written goes right meant tobe eight eight like chess like checkerboard keep mind meant square square great angle looking picture total eight times eight little square angle remember right also great angle one whole row like course rectangle right question many great angle right always please pause video first answer let read right yeah yes total less count right seriously count many think might bestill counting right right maybe finish video like still counting know going see theres efficient way figure rather count first strategy right first strategy think complete sense call divide conquer maybe like math one promise talking strategy dealing something hard let consider something easier something much doable consider smaller case let see one one course count one red tango right right two two situation consider smaller situation hopefully maybe answer right pattern answer figure case would wonderful n see let count going one two three four one two three four total eight right little four know like longer like eight keeping also one big one total nine right see see three three situation one two three four five six seven eight nine right remember step night let two pie say one two three four five six way seven eight nine eleven eleven twelve right put plus twelve let street one one two three four five six right two two yeah one two three four let yeah per watt last one last one plus course add real quick add another thing based first three case one breath tango goes right let see pattern plus right go nine thirty six plus two recognize right precisely two third power perfect cube right precisely three third power right also perfect cube imagine number need next well must add third power huh seem like four third power going plus get thats going number rectangle four four situation going guy verify right going guy count right kind cool next one go ahead plus five third power want make remark contain ing else right seem gentleman know still perfect sense n proof sometimes can not really judge pattern based first pattern may broken later induction right moment trust actually correct pattern right anyway let write guy real quick right nice situation taught going get situation course draw rectangle motive path yeah pretty much following know next one going plus third power right get right one disturb power one right every time power third power third power plus two third power plus third power plus dot dot eight third power calculator know type calculator seethe answer might mad counting right effusion n worry going help going make money cool one one squid story color one one square look nine three square look six square look square look figure pattern next one look page three add imagine next one add right fact pi situation could done following right saying let register square saying plus plus plus square right situation right plus plus plus plus dot dot square guy really cool formula want find sum fact need know sum first natural square result idea counting must equal right really nice dullness like icing cake let write power plus third power plus dot dot plus n third power right equal plus plus plus plus dot dot plus n square result n already five different ways yes oh right watch video way happen equal n times n plus power nice way argue find sum first said still best way let company work like one best world right go back big picture let big thing right right adult handle n look let show make great angle great angle course must two table bottom two sides one side one let say take rectangle poor three two situation yes four sides course remember said one side hereon top one side right bottom see right side many many ca n boy one horizontal line two three four five six seven eight nine see want select rectangle chose line number five site top line number seven stand bottom right many ways choose two total nine precisely nine choose two n right choose two tell number ways choose two thing total nice thing right thats good select well argument right one two three four five six seven eight nine well chose line number four site left night line number seven tobe site right still nach os let actually color actually matching right right top bottom nine choose two left right another work right nothing choose two squared write guy nine choose two square choose like like put next number eight stop need two term two division vision right fraction part right bottom divide factorial namely two times one work nine times two end right yes right one plus two plus three plus dot dot plus preset equal n plus choose exact argument watch previous video argument right number ways choose number know well guy seen video another way add one plus two plus three plus n way solution think component work right like anyway discrete mathematics guy hope guy like video yeah guy new channel please subscribe would like always music math fun many rectangle math fun many rectangle math fun
