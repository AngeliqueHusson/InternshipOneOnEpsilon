welcome there 's a rule out there fordivisible by three example if I look atthat number say 5 to 7 3 403 and ask I'masking if that 's divisible by 3 youwould say add up the digits and checkthat digits divisible 3 5 plus 2 is 7 7is 14 17 21 24 24 is a multiple 3 andparry that means this guy is divisibleby 3 in fact the same rule actuallyholds for 9 divisible by 9 add up thedigits and check if they 're divisible by9 what I say 24 24 is not divisible by 9so in this case this number is not amultiple of 9 so what I 'd like to dohere is take that rule a little bitfurther in fact 24 leaves a remainder of6 upon division by 9 I can claim thatthat rule actually tells me this thingwill leave remained with 6 upon divisionby 9 but let 's explore why do theserules work many people know the rulesthat taught the rules as youngsters butvery few people seem to go to explainwhat 's the mathematics behind that makesit clear why they work the way they doso let 's do it all right here goes ourarithmetic system is based on the number10 everything is in terms of powers of10 so we have powers of 1 groups of onesgroups of tens groups of 100 groups ofthe thousands groups of ten thousandsand so on let me explore divisible bynine first so let 's just go a little bitmakes a little bit easier for ourselves9 does it be a much friendlier numberfor divide 10 by 9 that leaves aremainder of one ninth of co-op of ninea hundred is one more than 99 off ofnine so that 's one more than north ofnine a thousand is one more than 999so these remainder of 1 upon division bynine 10,000 is one more than 9999 thatthese are remained at one point visionby nine in fact the number 1 itself upondividing by nine leaves a remainder of 9so all the numbers we base our rithmeticown they 've remainder 1 upon division bynineso if I take a number like five thousandeight hundred and twenty three I didn'treally think of this as five groups of athousand plus eight groups of a hundredthat is what we mean by arithmeticsystem in base ten two groups of ten andthree groups of one well what is athousand leave upon division by nine atleast a remainder of onewhat is a hundred leave upon division bynine remainder of one Tenley 's remainderof one and clearly one Lisa made of oneso if each group of a thousand these aremade of one that means five thousandswould leave a remainder of 5 ones fiveplus eight hundreds will leave aremainder of 8 ones eight plus two 10swould leave a remainder of two ones twoplus three ones will leave a major ofthree so actually upon division byNanshan write equals they opposed to myannive remainder five ones and eightones and two ones and three ones that'sthe same as a remainder of 18 ones thatis upon division by nine five thousandeight hundred twenty three these thesame remainder as eighteen does but 18is remainder of is a mobile of nine thatleaves a remainder of zero so actually Ican tell a right off the bat that fivethousand 23 is actually divisible bynine completely I let 's do another onelet 's do one that 's probably not as nicebecause I 'm making these things up onthe spot so I 'm surprised that oneactually did work out two three eightfour six all rightthat equals to lots of 10,000 plus threelots of a thousand plus eight groups of100 plus four groups of ten plus sixgroups of 1 upon division by nine dodododo what do I havewell ten thousand these remainder of 1so two lots of 10,000 Luminator of twolots of one a 1 and a 1 that 's 2 plusthree lots of a thousand if eachthousand leaves remainder of 1each group of thousand is one that givesa three groups of 1 3 8four and six so upon division by 9202846leaves the same remainder as the sum ofits digits that is 33,000 eighty-foursexually the remainder of what is thisthat 's 1010 of 23 upon division by nineactually apply the same rule 23 is twogroups of ten and three is one group ofone that 's at least the same Rangers twoplus three so actually I can say thisguy is not only not divisible by nine goa little bit further say it leaves aremainder of 5 upon division by nine allbecause our powers of 10 a very nicerespect to the number nine in fact rightnow I 'm gon na place the 9 with a 3 andsee the same is true for divisible by 310 is one more than 1 3 2 1 more than 9a hundred is one more than a multiple 3it 's one more than 99 a thousands onemore than bottle 3 it 's about more than999 and so on so actually the same ruleholds for divisible by 3 let 's look at20 2846 again there 's one little thingyou might not like so I should just gothrough it even that 's kind of clearthat all 's going to be fine but just toleave some things here I 'm gon na writeit out again forgive me for being slowthis is to lots of 10,000 plus 3 lots ofa thousand plus 8 lots of a hundred plusfor lots of 10 plus 6 lots of 1 upondivision by 3 that leaves a remainder of1 so 2 lots of 10,000 if 1 lot of 10,000is remainder 1 the 2 lots of 10,000 upondivision by 3 we will leave two ones toeach thousand leaves a remainder of 1Potter 's draw three so three groups of athousand would leave three ones whichI 'm going to write is three most peoplewant me to say that 0 but I 'll leave itas 3 for the moment still correct onehundred each hundred leaves a remainderof 1 so 8 100 leave a remainder of 8ones 8 which must be would say is 2 butthat 's ok I 'm still quit by saying it's8 ones left over for groups of one andsix groups of one so actually upondivision by 3/3 2046 leaves the sameremaindersome of its digits which is as we said23 so 820 mm 1846 has the same range was23 upon division by 3 which is the sameremainder as 2 Plus 3 which is 5 which Ican just say is the same as remainder of2 so upon division by 3 this guy leavesa remainder of 2 fabulous that 's itthat 's why divisible by 3 works add upthe digits if they themselves leave noremainder that means that we shall notonly is no remainderthat 's why it works now for fun for youthis number is interesting toopresumably by 11 our powers of 10a very nice respect to 11 this is goingto be a very curious one 10 theseremained out of 10 but let me say thesame thing as saying a remainder ofnegative 1 a hundred that 's one morethan 99 which is multiple 11 so thatlays remainder of 1 a thousand isactually one less than a multiple livinor if you like to you want to be cleverthink of a thousand as 10 times 10 times10 the slizz remainder of 1 this leavesremainder of 1 and remainder of onceactually leaves are made of 1 thrice sothis is same thing remainders minus 1cubed which is negative 110,000 is 10 to the fourth power pleaseremainder of 1 negative 1 to the 4thwhich is 1 so surely these this niceproperty of 11 with respect to ourpowers of 10 because a very nice tovisibly rule for 11 feel free to playwith this evening figure it out what youwant have a look at the appropriatechapter in this particular book allright thanks very much test
