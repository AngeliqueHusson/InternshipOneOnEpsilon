in order to find the area of any regularpolygon first we need to inscribe itinside a circle by doing that we'vecreated this apothem where thedefinition of the apothem is aperpendicular segment from the center tothe sides of the polygon but back upwhat 's the center well the center ofthis polygon is the center of the circlethat circumscribes the polygon so noticethat I can draw in a radius from thatcenter to a vertex and that is also theradius of the circle so if we zoom in onwhat 's going on with this apothem theperpendicular segment from the center toone of the sides of the vert of thepolygon and if I draw in two radii sincethe radius of a circle is constant we'vecreated an isosceles triangle sowhenever you draw an apothem andsegments to the vertices you are goingto create an isosceles triangle oneproperty of an isosceles triangle is ifyou have an altitude you are bisectingthat vertex angle so remember that thisapothem will bisect it and you will havetwo congruent base angles down here nowspecifically for a hexagon since I candraw in six radii we 're going to divide360 degrees six ways which means each ofthese angles up here is going to be 60degrees and since these two base anglesare congruent we 're going to haveequilateral triangles so this only worksfor a hexagon but remember when you'reproblem-solving that by drawing in yourradii you are creating six equilateraltriangles but this does n't give us anarea formula so what we 're going to haveto do is we 're going to have to think interms of this triangle let 's say I knewthe length of this base which is alsogoing to be our side length so I 'm goingto call that s I can calculate the areaof this triangle by saying my apothemwhich is the height of this triangletimes the base which is s and thendividing it in half that 's just thedefinition for the area of a triangle isthe basetype / - the question is how many ofthese triangles are we going to havewell in the case of a hexagon we'regoing to have six triangles so I wouldhave to multiply this by six and whatI 'm going to do is I 'm going togeneralize this formula and say thatinstead of writing six just for ahexagon I 'm going to write n for ann-sided polygon so this formula willonly work for a regular polygon whichmeans equilateral and equiangular so thearea formula is going to be the areait 's going to be the apothem times theside length times the number of sidesall divided by two and what you 're doinghere is you 're calculating the area ofone of these triangles and thenmultiplying it by however many trianglesyou have test
