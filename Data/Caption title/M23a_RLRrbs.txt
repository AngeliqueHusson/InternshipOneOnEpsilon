previously we looked at the basics ofquadrilaterals now we will study thatdifferent types look at thisquadrilateral ABCD in this quadrilateralthis pair of opposite sides is parallela B is parallel to CD and the other pairof sides is non parallel so ad and BCare the non parallel sides this kind ofquadrilateral where only one pair ofopposite sides is parallel is called atrapezium sometimes the non parallelsides are equal the quadrilateral wouldlook something like this a B is parallelto CD and ad is equal to BC these twosides are equal and non parallel such atrapezium is called an isoscelestrapezium so remember a trapezium willhave one pair of parallel sides and theother pair will be non parallel and ifthe non parallel sides are equal thenit 's Colinisosceles trapezium let 's look atanother type of quadrilateral it'scalled a kite we all know that a kitelooks something like this if we draw itwill look like this let a b c and d beits vertices in this kite these twosides are equal and these two sides areequal this is one adjacent pair of sidesand this is another pair of adjacentsides so we can say that in a kite twopairs of adjacent sides are always equalthe first pair of sides which are equalare a B and a D and the second pair ofequal lengths is C B and C D somedefinitions also say that the oppositesides of a kite are unequal a D will notbe equal to BC and a B will not be equalto C D we have now coveredbasics of trapezium and kite and we willcover more types of quadrilaterals inthe coming videos test
