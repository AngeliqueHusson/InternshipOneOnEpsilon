hi this is Mario from Mario 's mathtutoring in this video we 're going totalk about how to write a trianglecongruence statement sometimes this issomething that students have a lot oftrouble with when they 're working withproving triangles are congruent but whatyou want to do is you want to match upthe corresponding sides and thecorresponding angles and you want toprove the triangles congruent but youwant to write that statement and that'swhat we 're going to talk about in thisvideo so we 're gon na go through threeexamples let 's jump into it here withexample a what we 're gon na do is we'regonna try to show that these twotriangles are congruent now you want tolook for the hints so you can see thesearrows here they represent that thelines are parallel so what I'llsometimes do is I 'll extend you knowthese lines a little bit further like sookay and then I 'll extend thistransversal a little bit further likethis and then what you should be able tosee is that you 've got two lines cut bya transversal and we know from theprevious chapter that alternate interiorangles are congruent if the lines areparallel so in this case we can see thatthis angle and this angle are congruentwe also know that this segment DBis shared between these two triangles soit 's going to be congruent in bothtriangles by the reflexive property soI 'm just going to mark that so now wecan prove that these two triangles arecongruentexcuse me using the side angle side soyou can see this angle is in betweenthese two you know congruent sides tothis triangle you can see the includedangle and these two congruent sides nowhere 's the key so we 're proving thetriangles are congruent byside-angle-side let 's go ahead and writeour triangle congruence statements sotriangle blank is congruent to triangleblank okay now what I like to do this isjust my little strategy is you see howthere 's one mark here this one hash markthis one - and there 's two here andthere 's none here so what I 'll do isI 'll trace the triangle say C D B backto C now that goes one to zerodid you see how I did that so when I goto write this triangle let 's see we'vegot c d b c d b i went one to zero soi 'm going to do the same pattern I'mgoing to go one to zero so I 've got a Bd back to a so a BD now another way thatyou can take a look at it as you can saywell first and second that C D should becongruent to first and second that 's a ByepC D is congruent to a B they both haveone marking or you could say D be thatsecond and third should match up with BDokay you can see that 's true and thenwe 've got first and third C B iscongruent to ad so let 's see is thatright yep C B matches up with ad that'sanother way to do it but I like to traceit you know and then I can do it thatway too now another way to do it is youcould look at the corresponding anglesthat match up see what we 're doing iswe 're taking this triangle and we'reactually rotating it 180 degrees thisbottom triangle so that thecorresponding parts match up let 's go tothe next example so example B we'retrying to prove that these two trianglesare congruent you can see that theyshare WY between the two triangles soI 'm just going to put a mark there toshow that there that this is sharedbetween the two and it 's the same inboth triangles so you can see thesetriangles are congruent by the angleside angleokay angle sine angle so in thisparticular case this one was a rotationthis one is actually like a reflectionokay but when I write the trianglecongruence statement triangle blank iscongruent to triangle blank I 'm gon na golike this I 'm going to go angle with onemarking side angle with two markingsokay so I 'm following this pattern I'mgoing W Y Z back to W so W Y Z and thenover for this triangle see I 've got theone marking to back to this thing I'mgoing an go side angle and then aroundlike that so I 've got W Y X okay that'sone way to approach it another way toapproach is just see okay how everythingmatches up so if I fold this I can see Wmatches with itself W Y matches withitself Y so you can see W Y W Y and thenZ is matching with X okay third and lastexample here we 've got two triangles andyou can see if this is a right anglethis must also be a right angle becausethey form a linear pair or a straightline we can see that the hypotenuse isare congruent that 's the side that'sacross from the right angle and we alsoknow that this angle and this angle arecongruentbecause it 's marked as such so what wehave here is we have angle angle sideangle angle side so these triangles arecongruent by the angle angle side and weknow the triangle congruence statethat 's going to look something like thisbut we want to make sure we match up thecorresponding sides and thecorresponding angles so here let 's do itthis way let 's do triangle B e a nowthere 's more than one way to write theseokay you just want to make sure thatthey 're the corresponding parts match upso B ei so I went from the right angleto this angle to no markings right so Iwant to do the same thing right angleone marking - no marking so that 's goingto be BCD and now I know that thecorresponding parts are matching up nowonce you have the triangle congruencestatement you could write it in anynumber of ways like I could say let medo it this way AE B C is going to becongruent to DC B right that 's anotherway to write it or you could write it ashow else you can say you know e a B soI 'm doing second third first CD B secondthird first you just want to make surethat the corresponding parts match up sowhichever method that I demonstrate ityou know works best for youstick with that method until you knowyou can switch easily between thedifferent techniques so I hope thishelped you to understand how to workwith the writing trial congruencestatements better subscribe to thechannel I check out more math tutoringvideos on Mario 's math tutor and YouTubechannel and I look forward to seeing inthe future videos I 'll talk to you soon Triangle Congruence Statement -
