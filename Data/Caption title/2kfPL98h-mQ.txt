video begin looking differential equation introductory look really big topic written one topic looking introductory level seeing differential equation solve start example one screen x take note x derivative x respect think time often case fact derivative respect x function x right n simply variable function case afunction function time essential aspect differential equation function show equation differential equation x n variable value x afunction function show differential equation want solve x mean need find function x equation differential equation n mean find value x works find function x works little bit different simple equation like way back algebra example x plus equal want solve equation value x make equation true obviously x equal solution plug right x true statement different finding value finding function x function differential equation mean find function satisfy differential equation show definition solution finding solution differential equation often differential equation really important huge gigantic tremendously important big deal let see check box right differential equation important fact differential equation sare really equation naturally describe process es real world look world especially look physics naturally come differential equation thing see going real world differential equation good physics describe good useful describe thing going world see example go material see differential understanding natural world especially term physics solution provide us equation describe thing actually behave world college study physics engineering probably course differential equation sa typical college math sequence might look like calculus one integral calculus excuse differential calculus calculus two integral calculus integration calculus three calculus differential equation de typically fall college level math sequence sequence first example going show differential equation arise law first course need make sure everybody know law name physicist lived time newton although newton really n like hook hook actually guy kept newton intentionally newton much newton stayed n move back hook e die new incredibly introverted person n really like people stayed town die one hook came explain force spring wall let suppose spring attached wall like grab spring pull way distance x spring pull back force back direction f law say f equal make sense intuitively aspring something springy rubber band know farther stretch force force proportional distance like equation say pull right pull back left force spring opposite direction negative sign make sense intuitively empirical evidence n stretch spring beyond cal led elastic limit spring going behave amazingly linear fashion like equation imagine imagine wall floor spring attached let suppose mass end spring resting floor going extend floor little bit amass suppose pull distance x pull distance x release theres going force back spring going assume friction claw across floor although certainly could include case friction would later simple case first friction well know hook es law tell us f k x accurate description going force distance also mass think force acting mass typically comes mind law newton second law say comes differential equation start saying f equal also know f equal negative k x say equal negative k x know acceleration second derivative position write write times second derivative x squared x negative k x look x derivative x actually second derivative x x derivative showing equation differential equation show naturally understanding physics case physics force spring newton second law make sense x afunction time pull certain distance x release spring going pull back pull back going gain momentum back toward wall going get going get enough speed overshoot point star ted going go toward wall compress ing spring spring compress es going exert force back right going cause slow stop move back right going oscillate back make sense pull goes boring going going back forth frequency oscillate going depend mass stiffness spring going function time x function time differential equation describe situation could math solve equation could find function x x function time differential equation math fairly difficult solution bad show solution math solve solution would x equal tox initial position times cosine square root k n times k stiffness spring equation f k x mass position x function time could differentiate twice could find second derivative show equation hard getting equation little bit advanced going right come back exercise least show fact satisfy equation next video show another differential equation show sup real world actually work solution show get differential equation solution calculus
