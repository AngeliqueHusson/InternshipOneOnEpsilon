welcome around year b c fellow name devise algorithm method working common factor example suppose wish work common factor writing fraction fraction two number si know least contract one thats true pair theyre even common factor ask common well could suggest following take true keep smaller two ill keep adjust smaller number got let repeat algorithm keep small two case keeping adjust smaller take away ask common factor well repeat algorithm keep smaller keep adjust subtract ing smaller format take away one time keep smaller two adjust subtract ing smaller take away give common value try go algorithm ask true smaller seem like natural stopping point fact could said two common value common value indeed factor original two multiple multiple fact common factor approach technique one time time let work common factor safety let pretend see could say keep smaller adjust number smaller keep smaller adjust number smaller doit one time claim indeed common factor two original five common factor one example thats little extreme something like think come affected one algorithm show one goes keep smaller adjust keep small two adjust subtract ing smaller get small two keeping three adjust keep small two thats number two time adjust one one time give common value keep smaller adjust one yep algorithm telling common factor indeed important question work well kind neat really taking let say b pretend minus b claim key algorithm common factor b also common factor minus b vice let specific suppose going adjust become subtraction become let see specific common factor theyre even convective theyre theyre true common factor swell common factor even contract theyre multiple multiple think moment common factor process subtraction seem doesnt change common factor two fact make sense original two remain multiple nothing change difference two multiple multiple theyre right hand side give process traction change factor sand conversely like going backwards really process guy model six guy six kept first one added two multiple get fact two right multiple six addition preserve fact multiple six factor six process traction going backwards slow process addition change factor process like repeated maneuver smaller common factor one two three six common factor sare one time common factor wont change one time common factor wont change another time get common value common factor dont change interesting common factor well clearly common factor biggest common factor factor common factor obviously mean common friend sin particular biggest common factor original following works let get clear start b keep subtract ing smaller get common factor common common value process say common factor never change common factor b exactly particular biggest common factor b biggest common factor dand clearly therefore dis biggest common factor also biggest common factor one question could ever process repeated subtract ing never get common value end well think course process stop play game dealing pair theyre getting smaller stay realm positive ill never allow get case theres way keep going forever without going beyond forced stop mean point time going stop smaller subtract therefore equivalent algorithm must indeed terminate give factor two algorithm algorithm algorithm algorithm algorithm algorithm algorithm algorithm algorithm algorithm algorithm algorithm algorithm algorithm algorithm algorithm algorithm algorithm algorithm algorithm algorithm algorithm algorithm algorithm algorithm algorithm algorithm algorithm algorithm algorithm algorithm algorithm algorithm algorithm algorithm algorithm algorithm algorithm algorithm algorithm algorithm algorithm algorithm algorithm algorithm algorithm algorithm algorithm algorithm algorithm algorithm algorithm algorithm algorithm algorithm algorithm algorithm algorithm algorithm algorithm algorithm algorithm algorithm algorithm algorithm algorithm algorithm algorithm algorithm algorithm algorithm algorithm algorithm algorithm algorithm algorithm algorithm algorithm algorithm algorithm algorithm algorithm algorithm algorithm algorithm algorithm algorithm algorithm algorithm algorithm algorithm algorithm algorithm algorithm algorithm algorithm algorithm algorithm algorithm algorithm algorithm algorithm algorithm algorithm algorithm algorithm algorithm algorithm algorithm algorithm algorithm algorithm algorithm algorithm algorithm algorithm algorithm algorithm algorithm algorithm algorithm algorithm algorithm algorithm algorithm algorithm
