Determine whether the following numbers are prime , composite , or neither.So just as a bit of review , a prime numberis a natural number -- so one of the counting numbers , 1 , 2 , 3,4 , 5 , 6 , so on and so forth -- that has exactly two factors.So its factors are 1 and itself.So an example of a prime factor is 3.There 's only two natural numbers thatare divisible into 3 -- 1 and 3.Or another way to think about it is , the only way to get 3as a product of other natural numbers is 1 times 3.So it only has 1 and itself.A composite number is a natural numberthat has more than just 1 and itself as factors.And we 'll see examples of that and neither -- we'llsee an interesting case of that in this problem.So first let 's think about 24.So let 's think about all of the -- Iguess you could think of it as the natural numbersor the whole numbers , although 0 is alsoincluded in whole numbers.Let 's think of all of the natural counting numbersthat we can actually divide into 24without having any remainder.We 'd consider those the factors.Well , clearly it is divisible by 1 and 24.In fact , 1 times 24 is equal to 24.But it 's also divisible by 2.2 times 12 is 24.So it 's also divisible by 12.And it is also divisible by 3.3 times 8 is also equal to 24.And even at this point , we do n't actuallyhave to find all of the factors to realize that it 's not prime.It clearly has more factors than just 1 and itself.So then it is clearly going to be composite.This is going to be composite.Now , let 's just finish factoring it just since we started it.It 's also divisible by 4.And 4 times 6 -- had just enough space to do that.4 times 6 is also 24.So these are all of the factors of 24 , clearlymore than just one and 24.Now let 's think about 2.Well , the non-zero whole numbers that are divisible into 2 , well , 1 times 2 definitely works , 1 and 2.But there really are n't any othersthat are divisible into 2.And so it only has two factors , 1 and itself , and that 's the definition of a prime number.So 2 is prime.And 2 is interesting because it is the only even prime number.And that might be common sense you.Because by definition , an even number is divisible by 2.So 2 is clearly divisible by 2.That 's what makes it even.But it 's only divisible by 2 and 1.So that 's what makes it prime.But anything else that 's even is goingto be divisible by 1 , itself , and 2.Any other number that is even is goingto be divisible by 1 , itself , and 2.So by definition , it 's going to have 1and itself and something else.So it 's going to be composite.So 2 is prime.Every other even number other than 2 is composite.Now , here is an interesting case.1 -- 1 is only divisible by 1.So it is not prime , technically , because it onlyhas 1 as a factor.It does not have two factors.1 is itself.But in order to be prime , you haveto have exactly two factors.1 has only one factor.In order to be composite , you haveto have more than two factors.You have to have 1 , yourself , and some other things.So it 's not composite.So 1 is neither prime nor composite.And then finally we get to 17.17 Is divisible by 1 and 17.It 's not divisible by 2 , not divisible by 3 , 4 , 5 , 6.7 , 8 , 9 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 , or 16.So it has exactly two factors -- 1 and itself.So 17 is once again -- 17 is prime . test
