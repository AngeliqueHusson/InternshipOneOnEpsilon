video going outline two small proof deal radius diameter graph quick recap remember pair vertices graph distance length shor test path take particular vertex graph take look shor test path sand look maximum eccentricity vertex finally take look graph minimum radius maximum diameter would like quick review terminology click link video check description first example following want g graph disconnected complement graph connected diameter two work proof let check small example let draw one one four vertices isolated vertex three vertices really simple want draw vertices label want think edge original graph disconnected take look vertex isolated going adjacent three vertices careful side path three vertices two edge disappear complement edge goes top vertex bottom vertex put edge edge complement let see figure diameter clearly connected graph figure eccentricity vertex used tobe isolated longer isolated adjacent three well take look vertex v middle clearly ha sa distance one path side far take go hit take path length eccentricity equal two thing goes right know equal one two particular example mean diameter maximum two example worked go ahead see prove general general proof take g disconnected graph since graph disconnected know least two connected component remember connected component maximal connected sub graph graph want refresher difference word maximal maximum check video right links description alright connected component let call g let draw g rest graph may bunch component draw bunch blob maybe one blob could bunch want refer two set different thing going call set vertices first connected component thinking rest vertices however box separately like alright thinking two piece graph observe n drawn edge graph remember connected component mean edge green graph going lie within one going draw specific edge know edge blob sand important draw edge represent complement graph going use vertex set draw edge complement different color edge graph g within green want take vertex let call u set set vertices first connected component thinking think vertices set clearly edge graph g vertex connected said g lie within recap every vertex v v edge u v graph g mean edge graph g bar complement let draw generically use color pink remember color pink going represent complement graph obviously take look complement graph g lots going occur look particular green blob pair vertices adjacent longer vice n adjacent n really need worry rest blob whats really important happen first love talking rest v v far already observe vertex u vertex v adjacent vertex v set v distance equal complement graph know distance vertices set v big set v vertices could belong one side let consider case take two vertices v v big set v may different green blob original graph n care think connected complement graph may edge maybe maybe n sure edge vertex u back distance two could one definitely two next consider two vertices u u set v want also show connected path length may connected previously may may edge know since one side graph pink edge go side graph mean sis follow pink edge one side vertex back one u u vertices complement graph vertices distance away considered every possible pair vertices always found distance mean take maximum diameter almost conclude proof next example going show given graph center connected graph remember center set vertices whose eccentricity equal radius exactly statement mathematical notation think might proof go like start given graph g want build new graph let call h start given graph g draw big blob want add two new vertices let call u next want add bunch edge want add every edge u every vertex g edge every vertex g since definitely connected graph even g previously disconnected vertex g back one eu back vertex g completely connected graph point let draw edge generically pink quite done want add two vertices let call v v v v add edge though going add edge v u edge two big graph call h connected graph claim g center order see look let start look farthest think carefully eccentricity example obviously get one go one edge vertex graph h one five path length two get one finally one furthest possible vertex away b vertex v hopefully clear similarly eccentricity vertex v also symmetric next look vertex u obviously distance v fine farthest vertex away vertex v distance check eccentricity vertex thing goes vertex u symmetry finally let take look vertices x x vertex original graph g pair vertices original graph g may may added vertices u u know get path length n know going tobe worst possible case vertices v v sure path length vertex x graph g vertex b worst case know eccentricity vertices x equal mean us radius graph new graph fact diameter vertices neither center periphery fine finally know center new graph equal set vertices eccentricity equal radius case exactly vertices graph g proven exactly wan ted shown generic graph defined tobe center connected graph defined connected graph hope
