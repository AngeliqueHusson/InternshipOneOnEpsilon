in this video I 'm going to outline twosmall proofs that deal with the ideas ofradius and diameter of graphs just as aquick recap remember that if you'relooking at a pair of vertices in a graphthe distance between them is the lengthof a shortest path now if you take aparticular vertex in a graph and youtake a look at all those shortest pathsand you look at the maximum of thosethat 's the eccentricity of that vertexfinally if you take a look at all of theeccentricities in the graph and theminimum of that that 's the radius themaximum of all of the eccentricities isthe diameter if you would like a quickreview of this terminology just click onthis link for a video or check the linksin the description below okay our firstexample is the following we want toprove that if we have G a graph which isdisconnected then the complement of thatgraph is not only connected its diameteris at most two before we work through aproof let 's check out a very smallexample so let 's draw one okay I 'm gonnadrop one on only four vertices and Ihave an isolated vertex and then a pathon three vertices really simple so nowwhat I want to do is draw those verticesagain and label them and I want to thinkabout what are the edges in thecomplimentremember my original graph wasdisconnected so now if I take a look atthe vertex that was isolated before it'sgoing to now be adjacent to the otherthree vertices now be careful on theother side we had a path on threevertices and those two edges disappearin the complement but we do have theedge that goes from the top vertex downto the bottom vertex so we put that edgein okay that 's all of the edges in ourcomplement let 's see if we can figureout its diameter clearly this is aconnected graph we have to figure outall of the eccentricities so theeccentricity of the vertex that used tobe isolated and no longer is isolated isone because it 's adjacent to the otherthree well what about the eccentricitiesof the others if you take a look atvertex V 2 in the middle clearly it hasa distance one path to you on the otherside but how far does it take to go tohit thev3 that takes a path of length too soit 's eccentricity equals two and thesame thing goes for v1 and v3 all rightso we know that our eccentricities areequal to one or two in this particularexample which means that the diameterbeing the maximum is two okay we did anexample and it worked that 's not a prooflet 's go ahead and see if we can proveit in general for a general proof wehave to take G to be any disconnectedgraph now since the graph isdisconnected we know it has at least twoconnected components remember that aconnected component is a maximalconnected sub graph of the graph if youwant a refresher about the differencebetween the words maximal and maximumcheck out this video right here or thelinks in the description below alrightso now we have this connected componentlet 's call it G 1 and let 's draw it sohere we have G 1 now the rest of thegraph may have a bunch of components sowe 'll just draw a bunch of blobs maybethere 's only one more blob but there 's acould be a bunch and I want to refer tothese two sets as different things soI 'm going to call v1 the set of verticesin our first connected component thatwe 're thinking about and v2 the rest ofthe verticeshowever they are so I 'll just box themoff separately like that alright so nowI 'm thinking about these two pieces ofthe graph observe that I have n't drawnin any edges in the graph but rememberthat connected components means that anyedge in this green graph is going tohave to lie within one of those greenblobs now I 'm not going to draw anyspecific edges but what I do know isthat there are no edges between blobsand that 's important when I will drawthe edges that represent the complementof this graph I 'm going to use the samevertex set but I will draw the edges ofthe complement in a different color soremember the edges that have to do withthe graph G are within the green blobswhat I want to do now is to take anyvertex let 's call it u from the set v1remember that 's the set of vertices fromthe first connected component that we'rethinking about so if I think about allthe other vertices in the set v2 clearlythere are no edges in the graph G frommy vertex youto the other connected componentsremember we 've said that all of theedges in G have to lie within the bloppsknot between them to recap what thismeans is that for every vertex V in theset V 2 there is not an edge from u to Vin our graph G but that means that thereis an edge in the graph G bar thecomplement so let me draw all thoseedges in generically and I 'll use thecolor pink okay so remember now that thecolor pink is going to represent thecomplement graph obviously when I take alook at the complement of the graph Glots of other changes are going to occurif I look in any particular green blobif there was a pair of vertices thatwere adjacent they will no longer beadjacent and vice versa so if theywere n't adjacent now they are but Ido n't really need to worry about whathappens in the rest of the blobs what'sreally important is what happens betweenthat first love that I 'm talking aboutand all the rest between V 1 and V 2 inparticularso far we 've already observed that anyvertex U which belongs to the vertex atV 1 will be adjacent to any vertex Vwhich belongs to the set V 2 that meansthat their distance is equal to 1 in thecomplement graph but now we just knowthat the distance between vertices in myset V 1 and my big set V 2 have distance1 but what about vertices which couldbelong both in one side or both in theother let 's consider those cases solet 's take two vertices V 1 and V 2 frommy big set V 2 now they may havebelonged to different green blobs fromthe original graph but I do n't care Ithink about how they are connected inthe complement graph they may have anedge between them maybe they do maybethey do n't but for sure they do have anedge out to my vertex U and back so theyhave distance at most two it could beone but definitely it 's at most two nextconsider two vertices u 1 and u 2 frommy set V 1 I want to also show that theyare connected to each other by a path oflength at most - again they may havebeen connected previously or not sothere may or may not be an edge betweenthem but I do know that since both ofthese were in one side of the graphthey all have pink edges to go to theother side of the graph what that meansis I can follow a pink edge from one ofthem into the other side and then fromthat vertex back to the other one ofthose u 1 u 2 vertices so again I'vefound that in the complement graph thosevertices are at distance at most 2 awayfrom each othernow I 've considered every possible pairof vertices and I 've always found thattheir distance is at most 2 which meansthat all of the eccentricities are atmost 2 which means if I then take themaximum of that the diameter is almost 2and that concludes the proof for ournext example we 're going to show thatany given graph is the center of someconnected graph remember what the centeris it 's the set of all vertices whoseeccentricity is equal to the radiusthat 's exactly what this statement saysbut just in mathematical notation solet 's think about how we might do thisthe proof will go like this we start offwith any given graph G and we want tobuild a new graph let 's call it h sohere 's how we do it we start off withour given graph G and I 'll just draw itas a big blob now what we want to do isadd two new vertices let me call them u1 and u 2 next I want to add in a bunchof edges I want to add in every edgefrom u 1 to every vertex in G and anedge from u2 to every vertex in G sinceI 'm doing this I will definitely havecreated a connected graph even if G hadbeen previously disconnected now it cango from any vertex in G back to one ofthe EU 's and then back to any othervertex in G so now it 's a completelyconnected graph at this point and let mejust draw in the edges generically withthese pink lines okay we 're not quitedone we want to add in two more verticeslet 's call those V 1 and V 2 all I'mgoing to do with V 1 and V 2 is addmore edges though I 'm going to add theedge from V 1 to u 1 and the edge from V2 to you two okay this big graph herelet 's call it H this is the connectedgraph that we claim G is the center ofin order to see this we have to look atall of the eccentricities so we can lookat all of the eccentricitiescase-by-case let 's start off with theones that look farthest out those are v1and v2 think carefully about theeccentricity of v1for example obviously I can get from v1to u1 in one go in one edge and then toany vertex in the graph H with one moreso so five a path of length two now Ican get to u2 with one moreand finally v2 with one more so thefurthest possible vertex away from B 1is 4 and it 's that vertex V 2 hopefullythat 's clearsimilarly the eccentricity of vertex V 2is also 4 it 's symmetric next we 'll takea look at the vertex u 1 obviously ithas distance 1 to V 1 that 's fine butthe farthest vertex away from it isvertex V 2 and that 's at distance 3 soyou can check for yourself theeccentricity is 3 for that vertex andsame thing goes for vertex u 2 again bysymmetry finally let 's take a look atthe vertices X where X is a vertex in myoriginal graph G a pair of vertices inmy original graph G may or may not havebeen joined but now that we 've added inthe vertices u 1 and u 2 we know that wecan get to them in a path of length 2now we do n't know that that 's going tobe the worst possible case until we lookat vertices V 1 and V 2 for sure there'sonly a path of length 2 from a vertex Xwhich belonged to the graph G all theway out to vertex B 2 that 's the worstcase so we know that the eccentricity ofall of those vertices X is equal to 2what this means for us is that theradius of this graph this new graph His to and in fact the diameter is 4 andthere are some other vertices whichneither are in the center or theperiphery that 's fineso finally we know that the center ofthis new graph which is equal to the setof all vertices that have theireccentricity equal to the radius whichin this case is 2 is exactly thevertices of the graph G and we 've provenexactly what we wanted to we 've shownthat a generic graph can be defined tobe the center of some connected graph wedefined that connected graph we foundone I hope you 've enjoyed this videoclick here to check out related videosand I 'll see you next time test
