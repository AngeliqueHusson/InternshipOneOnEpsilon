So say you 're Arthur Stone , and you'reshowing your hexaflexagon to your friend , Tuckerman , and you 've already blown his mind by showing himit has three sides -- orange , yellow , pink , orange , yellow , pink -- but now you're about to extra super blowhis mind by showing him that there 's even more colors.And he 's like , whoa , where did the blue side come from ? But you 're having trouble finding all six.Like , you know there 's a green side somewhere in here , but where is it ? You 're all like , OK , Tuckerman , I think I found the green side.It 's right in here.Anyway , Tuckerman immediately decideshe needs to discover the fastest wayto get to all the colors , which he calls the Tuckermantraverse.So you and Tuckerman are working on that , and there 's hexaflexagons all over the lunch table , and another student is curious about what you 're doingand wants to join your committee.His name is Richard Feynman.So stop being Arthur Stone , and start being Brian Tuckerman.So you 're Tuckerman , and you teach Feynmanhow to make the hexa-hexaflexagonby first folding a strip of 18 triangles with the 19thfor gluing.You and Stone have just figured out how to numberthe faces before you fold them by dissectinga perfect specimen.You number them 1-2-3 , 1-2-3 , 1-2-3 , 1-2-3 , 1-2-3 , 1-2-3.Glue on one side.Flip it , and glue 4 , 4 , 5 , 5 , 6 , 6 , 4 , 4 , 5 , 5 , 6 , 6 , 4 , 4 , 5,5 , 6 , 6 on the other.You coil it around so that you get ones and twosand threes on the outside like 1 , 2 , 2 , 3 , 3 , 1 , 1 2 , 2 , 3 , 3 , and then fold that around into a hexagon , so that all the twos are on the front.And then flip it , and glue the two blue parts together , so that all threes are on the back.Feynman has some trouble flexing it , but you show him how to pinch two triangles together and thenpush in the opposite side.He somehow still does it wrong and ends up doing it backwards , flexing in reverse.Now he 's all intrigued by all the flexing possibilities , and you 're like , let me show you the Tuckerman traverse.But Feynman , being Feynman , is like , we must create a diagram.And Tuckerman 's like , really , it 's not that hard.No , diagram.So you 're Feynman , and you 've alreadyseen you can cycle from one to two to three , one , two , three.So you write that down with arrows and stuff.Or you can go backwards , but from one , two , and three , youcan also flex the other way , in which case one goes to six , or two to five , or three to four.And if you did one to six , once you 're at six , you can only flex one way , because the other does n't work.You have to go to three or backwards back to one.But then you notice that if you go to three , you can only flex one way , and the other is un-open-up-able.But before when you were on three , you could go either to one or four , but now you can only go to one.And you can go backwards to six , but notbackwards to two , which means that this three isn'tthe same three as the first three.Somehow it 's the same color , but in a different state.You show this to your friend John Tukey , and he 's like , oh yeah , that makes sense.And he draws a star in the middle of your threeand sits back as if that explained everything.So you 're like , whatever , and flip it back aroundto get to the other three and check it.The star turns into a not star.And from this alternate three , there'sthis 1-6-3 loop that connects to the main loop at one , whichis the same one as one has always been.But there 's a different one off of the main twoin the 2-5-1 loop.And of course , everything looks different if you flip it over.And these threes are also different , because they have different numbers on the other side.And you complete a diagram of possibilities , which allows you to find the optimal Tuckerman traverse.You also diagram the original trihexaflexagon , which is pretty simple.The flexagon committee approves your diagramsand decides to call them Feynman diagrams.Everything is going great until 1941 , because suddenly there's important war stuff to do , and flexagons are largely forgotten.OK.Now fast forward 15 years , and be Martin Gardner.You 're an amateur magician , and you'rehanging out at your friend 's placetalking about magician stuff.Anyway your friend shows you somethingyou 've never seen before -- a big flexagon he'smade out of cloth.And you 're thinking , hey , this is awesome.Maybe other people would like to know about this flexagon thing.So you write an article for Scientific American , and soon you 've landed yourself a gig writing a regular columnabout recreational mathematics called `` Mathematical Games , '' and it 's a huge success and gets hundreds of comments.I mean , letters , and there's nothing else like your column.And all the cool people are inspired by you , and you 're pretty much the reasonwhy people know about things like tangrams , and Conway 's Game of Life , and the work of MC Escher , and other things like that.Now fast forward 50 years , and say you'reme in the generation of people inspired by Martin Gardnerare now the people inspiring you.So he 's your math inspiration grandfather.And now you yourself are in the business of mathematicallyinspiring people , and you want themto be aware of their math inspiration heritage.OK , now say you are you.If you think hexaflexagons are coolthat was just column number one.And I invite you to join in with the hundreds of peopleto celebrate Martin Gardner's birthday every October 21.This year , there will be hexaflexagonparties in homes and schools all over the world.And if you want to attend or host one , check the description.I 'm celebrating by making these videos , and also I just like the image of flexagons everywhere -- floating around lunch tables , spilling out of your pockets , lost in your couch cushions.I like to keep some ready to deploy outof my wallet or tiny yellow purse , in case of a flexagon emergency.And then there 's more recent innovationsin flexagon technology , and all the cool ways to colorthem , and other stuff.But that will have to wait until next time .
