let 's put a handful of chess pieces downon an infinite chessboard all the piecesmove according to their usual rule butthere are no bounds on how far they canmove who will win and in how many movesto understand infinite chef let 's startwith finite chess tests the kind of gamemathematicians like for one it 's a gameof perfect information which means thateverything is out in the open to beanalyzedunlike poker where relevant informationthe other players hand is his testdoes n't involve randomness games ofchance like those that involves dice areoften harder to analyze and you can'tguarantee an answerchess only has two players and providedyou play with some standard rules aboutnot repeating positions each game mustend in a finite number of moves let'salso assume we 're playing with somerules that exclude ties that will makethings simpler mathematicians have manyfavorite examples of these kinds ofgames chef 's checkers Godot sandboxesand many more check out the links in thedescription to learn more about thesemathy games chef 's even in its finiteversion is complicated let 's start witha simpler game a single tile version ofNIM which I 'll call pile games startwith a big pile of marbles Alice and Bobalternate taking one two or threemarbles from the pile and the person whotakes the last marble winslet 's say they start with five marblesand Alice takes three Bob could take onebut then he 'd lose because Alice willtake the final one a better idea is forhim to take the final two then he 'll winthis game seems a little boring but thestrategy behind it is pretty cool ifthey start with n marbles what 's thebest strategy for Alice what about Bobif you have n't seen this problem beforeI strongly recommend playing withdifferent numbers of starting marblesand trying to find a strategy we canmake a game tree for our pile game whichis sort of like a diagram of allpossible gamesif we start with five marbles Alice canpick either one two or three marblesthen they 'll be for three or two leftrespectively then we map Bob 's traces inthe same way then Alice 's that Bob 's andthen Alice 's each time someone takes thelast marble we mark their wins noticethat Alice has a winning strategy whichmeans that she has a method of playingthat guarantees she will win first shepicks one marble then bob has threechoices take one two or three regardlessof what he does she can respond in a waythat guarantees her win by definition atmost one player in a game can have awinning strategy not both so if bothplayers are playing optimally Alice willwin but how long will it take for Aliceto win let 's define a Doomsday Clock theDoomsday Clock tells us how many movesit will be until the inevitable winnerAlice in this case twins by the waythat 's not a math term mathematicianjoel hampton calls this the game valueand in chess they 'd call this matin nlet 's look at a game with five marblesin the beginning the Doomsday Clock isthree Alice can force a win in threemoves after she moves the Doomsday Clockis two no matter what Bob does he'lllose in two moves after he goes theclock is one meaning Alice wins aftershe makes her turn okay here 's animportant definition for us a game isdetermined if one player has a winningstrategy and here 's an important theoremknown as their Melo theorem every gameof the type we 've been talking aboutgames with perfect information norandomness to alternating players noties theending a finite number of moves justthese kind of games are determined youcan actually use the game tree to provetheir Mallos theorem by backtrackingthrough the tree I 'll let you fill inthe details of the proof or give anentirely different fruits let us knowwhat you 're thinking in the comments whyis this such a big deal well for one itimplies that chess the normal finiteversion is determined there is either astrategy for white or a strategy forblack that will guarantee a win ofcourse nobody knows this strategy mostlybecause the game tree is really huge nowlet 's move into the world of infinitegames infinite games are ones that couldlast infinitely many moves our bigtheorem about finite games was that theyare determined now the analogousquestion is are infinite gamesdetermined does one player have awinning strategy well just like prettymuch every other time we step from thefinite world to the infinite worldthings get weirder whether or not allinfinite games are determined is acomplicated issue depending surprisinglyon what set theory axioms you choose butwithin the standard system vfc there aresome types of infinite games which aredetermined and there are some gameswhich are not determined what mattersfor our purposes is the infinite chef'sis determined there is a winningstrategy so from any starting positionone player in infinite chess will alwayshave a winning strategy let 's get moreprecise about the infinite chess we'replaying both white and black have atmost one King on the board and andalways the goal is to capture the otherside 's King normal checkmateand importantly that checkmate willalways happen at some finite time duringthe game there can be any number of anyof the other pieces including possiblyinfinitely many starting off in anyarrangement the pieces move normally butthey 're unboundedfor example the king can hop one in anydirection and the bishop can movediagonally as far as it wantsknowing that infinite chest isdetermined we can ask about winningstrategies from different startingpositions is white or black guaranteedto win from a given starting positionand how long does it take to force a winthat is what 's our Doomsday Clock sayhere 's a starting position where whiteis guaranteed to win in six moves blacksKing is stuck and so it needs to movethe rook up white moves its rook to keepthe king in check black moves its kingbut white can follow with its Queen theWhite Queen and rooks continue tosqueeze the black King up to thebarricade until it 's stuck and forcedinto checkmate so on the first movewhat 's the Doomsday Clock well black hasa few options it can move the rook likeit did and lose in six moves or dosomething silly like move one of theponds in which case white will win intwo moves well in this situation we saythat the Doomsday Clock is six becausethat 's the longest black can hold outbefore its King is captured it 's themaximum time before the game ends butcan the Doomsday Clock the infinite inthe Hydra episode we discussed infiniteordinal infinite counting numbers afterall of the natural numbers 0 1 2 3 4 andso on we have the first infinite ordinalOmega then comes Omega plus 1 Omega plus2 and so on then Omega times 2 Omegatimes 2 plus 1 and so on then Omegatimes 3 Omega times 4 then Omega to theOmega and Omega to the Omega to theOmega and so on let 's look at thispositions it 's like before exceptthere 's no line of pawns blocking therook notice that the same thing happensthe black rook moves up to make way forthe king and the white queen and rookcontinue to chase the black king upuntil it gets trapped by the rook theonly difference between this and beforeis that now the black rook can move asfar as it wants on the first turn thefurther the rook moves away the longerit will take before the white queen androok trap the black King against it sowhat 's the Doomsday Clock say at theinitial position well the further theblack rook moved on its first turn thelonger the game lasts and the black rookcan move an arbitrarily large but finitenumber of mooks so white will eventuallyafter a huge finite number of movescapture the black king since there 's nolimit to how far away the rook can movethere 's no limit to the number of movesthe game could last the Doomsday Clockis the maximum length a game can last itmust be bigger than all the finitenumbers it must be the first infiniteordinal Omega all the games are finitebut unbounded in length so the DoomsdayClock is infinite champions and hiscollaborators have developed anincredible amount of infinite chestmathematics they came up with the chessposition we just looked at and have alsodemonstrated a starting position ininfinite chess where the Doomsday Clockis Omega square this is because thereare two separate times in which blackcan delay its inevitable death by anarbitrarily large number of movesthere 's even examples of infinite chesswith doomsday clock Omega squared times4 and Omega to the fourth we 've linkedto these results and a bunch more in thedescription there 's so many cool ideasbehind infinite chef 's that we couldmake several more episodes on it can youconstruct an interesting startingposition in infinite chessdoes someone have a winning strategy letus know in the comments see you nextweek oninfinite series hello I wanted torespond to some of the comments aboutour fair division episode so the or andseveral others made an interesting pointin real life you might not always pickthe free room if there 's another roomand it 's cheap and it 's way better thanthe free room you probably pick that onebut in order to get all the maths towork out some nicely we needed to makesome assumptions about our mathematicalmodel and one of the assumptions we madeinside of our model was that you wouldalways choose a free room to a non freeroom all rightthese math e stuff answered ourmini-challenge showing that there 's anodd number of fully labeled ripsbasically there are an odd number ofrooms which you can access from theoutside and there are an even number ofrooms which you can not access from theoutside this is an odd number plus aneven number is not a number that meansthere 's an odd number in total of fullylabeled room you should check out thecomments for more detailsfinally elevating moment ask anintriguing question can you read thesystem can you lie about your roompreferences in order to get a betteroutcome maybe why you might also get youa worse outcome you might end up with aroom you hate I 'd be really curious tosee if one of you can come up with anexample where lyingimproved your outcome or maybe it makesit worse alright see you next week Infinite Chess | Infinite
