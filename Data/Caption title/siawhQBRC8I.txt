This is actually a little paper calculator that I made.You follow the tube , these split off . These tubes are drectional.Your first choice is wether you want to choose zero or one.Which would you like to choose ? Let 's choose zero.So you choose zero , that leads to this instruction to flip.We flip the page , ... ... continue down.Plus - you do n't choose the operator.But you do choose the next number ... ... that you want to add to zero.One , let 's do Zero plus one.Zero plus one.Go here.Then you just follow the tubes - this is all done automatically.You follow ... Zero plus one is one.That 's your answer , zero-one is the answer.Let 's do Zero plus Zero.Zero plus zero , okay.So you start here , you choose zero.This tells you to flip.So theres your zero.Let 's choose to add another zero.So we 'll flip againSo you 'll notice , when you flip these flaps , they can either connect or block off certain pathways later on.So that 's basically how it all works.You follow ... ... these paths ... When you get here , it says to flip.Then you get to the end.So ... Your answer is ... zero-zeroAlright , let 's do one plus one , Jason.OKI 've always wanted to know what that is.What a good thing I 've got this calculator here.I 'll go ahead and choose this one.Leads me to one.And another one.That goes to the `` equal '' -sign.Tells me to flip.Tells me to flip again.And there is our answer.One-zero.Or two in binary.This is basically how calculators and Computers work , you know , electronic versions of these mazes.If you 'd like to know why on earth Jason was making a calculator out of paper , you really Need to see what came beforeand what 's coming next.Have a look to These extra Videos we 're putting on numberphileeither right now or very soon . test
