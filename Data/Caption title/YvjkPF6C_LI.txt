all right in this video we 're going todo an example of finding the inverse ofa 3x3 matrix if one exists and we'regoing to do this by using cofactors anddeterminants so the first one we'regoing to do here will find the inverseof this matrix 0 0 1 2 negative 1 3 1 14 the first thing I 'm going to do isfind the determinant of a and there'sdifferent notations for the determinanteither the absolute but it looks likethe absolute value of a I always sawjust written as Det a so determinant ofa to get the determinant of this matrixI 'm going to expand along the first rowso it looks like we 'll get 0 timesnegative 1 3 1 & 4 and then minus 0 andwe 'll have to multiply that by thedeterminant of it looks like 2 3 1 & 4and then we 'll add 1 times we 'll have totake the determinant of 2 negative 1 and1 1 well the first one 0 the secondone 's going to be 0 then it looks likewe have 1 times let 's see we 'll get 2times 1 which is 2 minus 1 timesnegative 1 which will be plus 1 so itlooks like we 'll get 1 times 3 or withthe determinant to be 3 okay so that'sone thing that 's going to be what youuse that here in a little bit the nextthing I 'm going to do is go aboutfindingI 'm going to basically use the towfactors so the way we do that isbasically I look well at the first youknow if I cover up the first the firstrow in the first column I 'm going to beleft with this the numbers negative 1 31 & 4 so that 's what 's going to I'mgoing to calculate the determinant ofthat I 'm going to have to fill in somesigns here in a second too so I 'll getto that in just a moment next if wecover up the first row and the secondcolumn it looks like we 're going to beleft with 2/3 1 & 4 so 2 3 1 & 4 and ifwe cover up the first row in the lastcolumn we 'll be left with the 2 negative1 1 & 1 so 2 negative 1 1 & 1next if we cover up the second row andthe first column we 'll be left with 0 1 & 1 4 so 0 1 1 & 4 if we cover up thesecond row in the second column we 'll beleft with it looks like 0 1 & 1 & 4let 's see if we look at if we cover upthe second row in the third column itlooks like we 'll have 0 0 & 1 1 & lastlyif we cover up the third row and thefirst column it looks like we 'll be leftwith 0 1 negative 1 & 3 if we cover upthe third row in the second column we'llbe left with 0 1 2 3 and then if wecover up the third row and the thirdcolumn will we be left with 0 0 2 andnegative 1 ok so we still have to putour signs in here as well so it justalternates a positive negative positivenegative positive negative positivenegative positive alright so the nextthing I 'm going to do is actuallycalculate the values of all thesedeterminants so let 's see we would getnegative 1 it looks like we would getnegative 4 minus 3 that would benegative 7 we would get 8 minus 3 8minus 3 would be 5 but we have to usethe minus sign out front so we 'll getnegative 5 we 'll get 2 minus negative 1or 2 plus 1 which will be 3 0 times 4 is0 minus 1 so we 'll get a negative 1 forthe determinant but we have to multiplythat by the negative so we 'll get apositive 1 0 times 4 is 0 minus 1 sowe 'll get a negative 1 and then whatlooks like we 'll just have 0 timesexcuse me 0 minus 0 so 0 there 0 times 3is 0 minus negative 1 will give us apositive 10 times 3 is 0 minus 2 so we 'll get anegative 2 for the determinant but withthe extra negative it will switch backto positive 2 0 times negative 1 and 0minus 2 times 0 is 0 but this time we'vegot well it does n't really matter we'vegot a positive but who cares becausewe 're getting 0 anyway ok so the nextthing we have to do is we 're going tohave to now do a little reflection andwhat we do is we reflect things aboutthe diagonal so this is going to be thediagonal those numbers are going to stayright where they 're at okay so I 'm notgoing to move those numbers at all solet 's see I 'm going to leave thenegative 7 the negative 1 and the 0alone but then we reflect the otherelements about the diagonal so the 1 andthe negative 5 are going to switchplaces so I 'm going to get a negative 5and a positive 1 let 's see the 1 and thepositive 3 switch places so I 'm going toget a 3 in the bottom left and a 1 inthe top right and likewise the the 2 andthe 0 we 're going to switch places so my2 is going to go up here my 0 is goingto go down here the last thing I do is Itake 1 over the determinant well thedeterminant we found was 3 so I 'm goingto multiply every entry by 1/3 and thisis now going to be our inverse matrix soif we multiply everything by 1/3 itlooks like we get negative 7/3 it lookslike we 'll get 1/31/3 negative five-thirds negative 1/32/3 will get 3 times 1/3 which is 1 andthen we 'll get zeroes for other entriesand we have now found our inverse matrix test
