Hi there , welcome to Math Antics ! So far , in our series on geometry , we 've learned about points , lines , planes and angles.In this lesson , we 're going to learn about another important element of geometry.We 're going to learn about polygons.You probably already know a lot about polygons because you see them all the time.Here 's some common examples that you might recognize.These shapes are all polygons . That 's because a polygon just means a multi-sided shape , and these shapes all have multiple sides.Okay , so that 's a basic definition of a polygon , but to really understand what is a polygon and what is NOT a polygon , we need to learn about the specific properties that all polygons have in common.First we need to know the three parts that make up all polygons.And these parts are : sides , vertices , and angles.The sides are just the straight line segments that make up a polygon.And the vertices are points where the sides intersect.And the angles are formed by the intersecting lines.In fact , in Greek , the word polygon literally means `` many-angles . `` So all polygons have sides , vertices and angles.This polygon here has 5 sides , 5 vertices and it forms 5 angles.The next thing we need to know about polygons is that they 're 'closed ' shapes.Now what does it mean for a shape to be closed you ask ? Well , it means that the sides are connected so that there are no gaps.The area inside the shape is separated from the area outside the shape , and there 's no way to get from the inside to the outside without crossing a line.It might help to think of a closed shape like a cage.If you put an ant inside the cage , there 's no way for it to get out without crossing a line.But if the shape is open , then there is a way out.So these are all examples of closed shapes , and these are all examples of open shapes.And the important thing to remember is that a polygon must be closed.And the last thing we need to know about polygons is that they 're 2 dimensional , or flat shapes.And that means that all the vertices must lie on the same plane.If any one of the vertices were to move forwards or backwards , so that it was n't in the same plane as all the other vertices , then it would n't be a flat shape anymore.Flat shapes are also called planar shapes because all of their points are on the same plane.And even though polygons themselves ca n't be 3D shapes , you can use polygons to make 3D shapes.Like a box , for example . The box is not a polygon.But each of it 's flat sides is a polygon.Alright then . We now have a specific definition of a polygon.A polygon is a multi-sided shape that has sides , vertices and angles.A polygon is a closed shape , and a polygon is a 2 dimensional , or flat shape.And now that you know that , it 's time to play `` Polygon or NOT a Polygon ! `` Now here 's your host : me ! Thank you , thank you ! Alright . Now the rules of the game are simple.I 'm gon na show you a shape , and you tell me if it 's a shape , and you tell me if it 's a polygon or not a polygon.Are you ready to play ? Our first shape is a square ! Is a square a polygon ? Yes ! A square has 4 sides and 4 vertices and it 's a closed , 2D shape.So it is a polygon.And next we have , hmmm . I 'm not exactly sure what to call this , but , is it a polygon ? Nope ! It 's close , but because it 's an open shape , it ca n't be a polygon.Alright , what about this one ? Polygon or not a polygon ? Yep ! It is a polygon . Even though the sides are not all the same length , it is a closed , 2D , multi-sided shape . In fact , if you count , you 'll see it has 7 sides.Ah , how about this one ? Is a circle a polygon ? Well , it is a closed , 2D shape , but how many sides does it have ? Now that 's the problem.A circle does n't have any straight sides , vertices or angles.It 's a curved shape , so it 's not a polygon.Next we have a star shape , just like me ! Is this a polygon ? Yup ! It has straight sides and vertices , and it 's a closed , 2D shape.That means it 's a polygon ! And what about this one ? Right you are , this is not a polygon ! It 's a dog ! Ahh , here 's an interesting one . It 's a closed , 2D shape that does have straight sides andvertices , but , it also has this curved part here . Can it still be a polygon with that curve there ? No ! The curved part disqualifies it as a polygon.A polygon has to have only straight sides , so this is not a polygon.And what about this guy here ? Is this a polygon ? Well , it is just straight lines , but two of those lines cross , and if any lines cross it ca n't be a polygon . Plus , he has this big open end here . So this guy is definitely not a polygon.And last of all , what about this one ? Right you are , this is not a polygon because it 's a 3D shape . It 's made from polygons , but the whole shape is not a polygon itself.Well , that 's all the time we have for this week.Join us next week as we decide : '' Is it Bigger than One ? `` Okay , so after playing that game , you have a really good idea of what a polygon is , and what it is not.The last thing I want to mention is that some polygons have special names depending on how many sides they have.Here 's a list of the most important ones to know:3-sided polygons are called triangles . Triangle are so important in geometry , that they 'll get a whole video of their own.4-sided polygons are called quadrilaterals.Wow ! Now that 's a fancy math word ! But it helps if you just remember that the first part , `` quad , '' means `` 4 . `` Quadrilaterals are shapes like squares , rectangles , and parallelograms.They 'll also get a video of their own.5-sided polygons are called pentagons.6-sided polygons are called hexagons.And 8-sided polygons are called octagons.By the way , polygons that have 5 , 6 , 8 , or however many sides like this , are called regular polygons if all of their angles are equal , and irregular polygons if their angles are not equal.Of course , there are a lot more polygons than that , but you probably wo n't need to know their names.As long as you know what polygons are , and how to identify them , then you 're ready to move on.The exercises for this section are pretty easy , so no excuses ! Good luck ! Thanks for watching Math Antics , and I 'll see ya next time.Learn more at mathantics.com Math Antics - Polygons Math Antics - Polygons Math Antics - Polygons
