hi welcome math far series geometry weve learned point angle sin lesson going learn another important element geometry going learn probably already know lot polygon see common example might recognize polygon thats polygon mean shape multiple thats basic definition polygon really understand polygon polygon need learn specific polygon common first need know three part make polygon sand part sides vertices sides straight line segment make polygon vertices point sides intersect angle formed intersect ing line sin fact word polygon literally mean polygon sides vertices polygon sides vertices form next thing need know polygon theyre closed shape snow mean shape closed ask well mean sides connected area inside shape separate area outside shape theres way get inside outside without crossing line might help think closed shape like cage put ant inside cage theres way get without crossing line shape open way example closed example open shape sand important thing remember polygon must last thing need know polygon theyre dimensional flat shape sand mean vertices must lie plane one vertices move forwards backwards wasnt plane vertices wouldnt flat shape also cal led planar point plane even though polygon cant use polygon make box example box polygon flat sides specific definition polygon polygon shape sides vertices angle sa polygon closed shape polygon dimensional flat shape know time play polygon polygon host thank alright rule game gon na show shape tell shape tell polygon polygon ready play first shape square square square sides vertices closed polygon next exactly sure call polygon nope close open shape cant one polygon polygon yep polygon even though sides length closed shape fact count see one circle polygon well closed shape many sides thats problem circle doesnt straight sides vertices curved shape polygon next star shape like polygony straight sides vertices closed shape mean polygon one right polygon interesting one closed shape straight sides also curved part still polygon curve curved part polygon polygon straight sides polygon guy polygon well straight two cross cross cant polygon plus big open end guy definitely polygon last one right polygon shape made polygon whole shape polygon well thats time week join us next week decide bigger game really good idea polygon last thing want mention polygon special depending many sides list important polygon cal led triangle triangle important geometry theyll get whole video polygon cal led quadrilateral swow thats fancy math word help remember first part quad mean like square rectangle also get video polygon cal led polygon cal led hexagon sand polygon cal led way polygon however many sides like cal led regular polygon angle equal irregular polygon angle equal course lot polygon probably wont need know long know polygon identify ready move exercise section pretty easy excuse good luck thanks watching math antic ill see ya next time learn math antic polygon math antic polygon math antic polygon math antic polygon math antic polygon math antic polygon math antic polygon math antic polygon math antic polygon math antic polygon math antic polygon math antic polygon math antic polygon math antic polygon math antic polygon math antic polygon
