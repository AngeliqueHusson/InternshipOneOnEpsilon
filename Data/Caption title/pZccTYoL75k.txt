look work similar approach notice radius slant height almost next notice top formula almost pi r squared lateral surface area bottom pi r squared base almost identical except height slightly radius looking little closer see slant height radius would essentially flat circle would simply area two circle pi r squared plus pi r squared first pi r squared area base second area lateral surface look taller cone like think slant height center flat circle upward case slant height thats double radius instead pi r squared lateral surface dealing pi times radius times slant height slant height radius second circle weve upward therefore surface area cone area base plus lateral area area pi r squared lateral area instead pi r squared radius becomes slant height thats formula investigating surface area cone area circle plus area circle investigating surface area cone area circle plus area circle investigating surface area cone area circle plus area circle
