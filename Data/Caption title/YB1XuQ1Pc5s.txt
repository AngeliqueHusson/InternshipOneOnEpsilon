A photo finishing store charges customers a rate of $ 0.29 per photo to print pictures.For new customers , the store offers aone-time discount of $ 3.Write a function representing the amount that a new customerwould have to pay to have x number of photos printed.So x is the number of photos printed.So just a regular customer would have to pay the numberof photos times $ 0.29 a photo.So if we just said , let y be the amount that a customerwould have to pay , a regular customer would have to pay xtimes $ 0.29 per photo.So we 'd write 0.29 -- we could put the dollar sign there ifyou want -- or 0.29 -- we're assuming everything isdollars -- x.That 's how much a regular customer would have to pay.But they 're asking us a first time , a new customer.And they say that the new customer gets a one-timediscount of $ 3.So a new customer will pay this minus $ 3.So this right here is pretty much a simplified version of afunction that would describe what a new customer would pay.If you wanted to get fancy , this is a little bitinaccurate when the customer ordered less than 10 photosbecause , let 's say the customer orders 10 photos.Then x is going to be 10 times $ 0.29 is $ 2.90 minus 3 isnegative $ 0.10.The customer is not going to pay negative $ 0.10 , whichwould be like the store paying them $ 0.10 for them to print10 photos , the customer 's not going to pay anything.So what we could do if we wanted to make this a littlebit fancier , we could say that a new customer would pay -- andthen we can say that 's y , so y is equal to 0.29x minus 3 if xis greater than 10 , if the guy or the gal ordersmore than 10 photos.It 's 0 otherwise.Then they do n't pay anything.If it 's less than 10 photos , they pay nothing.It 's not like the store 's going to pay them , because ifyou 're less than 10 , or 10 or less , actually , then this isgoing to become negative and we do n't want a situationwhere it 's negative.So they 're either going to pay nothing , but if they get morethan 10 photos , then they're going to pay based on thisfunction right there .
