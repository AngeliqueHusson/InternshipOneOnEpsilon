- IF F OF X IS NEGATIVE , INCREASING , AND CONCAVE DOWNTHEN THE ANTIDERIVATIVE FUNCTION BIG F OF XIS ONE OF THE FOLLOWING : DECREASING IN CONCAVE UP , DECREASING IN CONCAVE DOWN , INCREASING IN CONCAVE DOWN OR INCREASING IN CONCAVE UP.LET 'S BEGIN BY REVIEWING THE DEFINITIONOF THE ANTIDERIVATIVE FUNCTION.BIG F OF X IS AN ANTIDERIVATIVE OF SMALL F OF XIF BIG F PRIME OF X EQUALS SMALL F OF X.SO NOTICE HOW HERE WHEN WE 'RE GIVEN INFORMATIONABOUT F OF X WE CAN THINK OF THIS AS INFORMATIONABOUT BIG F PRIME OF X.AGAIN , BECAUSE BIG F OF X IS THE ANTIDERIVATIVE OF F OF XIT 'S DERIVATIVE EQUALS SMALL F OF X.SO TO BEGIN WE 'RE TOLD THAT F OF X IS NEGATIVEWHICH MEANS BIG F PRIME OF X IS NEGATIVEAND THE SIGN OF THE FIRST DERIVATIVE INDICATESWHETHER A FUNCTION IS INCREASING OR DECREASING.SO BECAUSE BIG F PRIME OF X IS NEGATIVE BIG F OF XWOULD HAVE TO BE DECREASING.SO AGAIN , IF F OF X IS NEGATIVE WHICH EQUALS BIG F PRIME OF XTHIS INDICATES THAT BIG F IS DECREASING.REMEMBER OUR GOAL HERE IS TO INDICATEWHICH OF THESE IS TRUE ABOUT BIG F OF X.NEXT WE 'RE TOLD THAT F OF X IS INCREASING.WELL IF F OF X IS INCREASING THEN F PRIME OF XWOULD HAVE TO BE POSITIVE AND IF F PRIME OF X IS POSITIVETHEN BIG F DOUBLE PRIME OF X WOULD ALSO BE POSITIVE.SO AGAIN , F PRIME OF X EQUALS BIG F DOUBLE PRIME OF XWHICH WE KNOW IS POSITIVEAND THE SECOND DERIVATIVE INDICATES CONCAVITYSO BECAUSE THE SECOND DERIVATIVE OF BIG F IS POSITIVETHIS MEANS BIG F OF X WOULD HAVE TO BE CONCAVE UP.IF THE SECOND DERIVATIVE WAS LESS THAN ZERO OR NEGATIVETHAT MEANS BIG F WOULD BE CONCAVE DOWNAND WE 'RE ALSO TOLD THAT F OF X IS CONCAVE DOWN.WELL IF F OF X IS CONCAVE DOWNTHAT MEANS THE SECOND DERIVATIVE OF FWHICH IS ACTUALLY THE THIRD DERIVATIVE OF BIG FWOULD HAVE TO BE NEGATIVE.BUT THIS INFORMATION IS ACTUALLY NOT NEEDEDTO ANSWER THE QUESTION.WE NOW KNOW THAT BIG F IS DECREASING AND CONCAVE UPAND THEREFORE OUR ANSWER IS THIS FIRST CHOICE HERE DECREASINGAND CONCAVE UP.LET 'S FINISH BY SKETCHING A POSSIBLE GRAPH FOR BIG F OF X.BECAUSE BIG F IS DECREASING WE KNOW AS X INCREASES Y DECREASESOR THE FUNCTION MUST GO DOWNHILL FROM LEFT TO RIGHT , AND IF THE FUNCTION IS CONCAVE UP IT MUST RESEMBLE AT LEASTA PIECE OF A GRAPH THAT LOOKS LIKE THIS BUT AGAIN , BECAUSE OUR FUNCTION IS DECREASINGIT WILL ONLY RESEMBLE THE LEFT SIDE OF THIS GRAPHTHAT 'S CONCAVE UP SO BIG F OF X COULD LOOK SOMETHING LIKE THIS.NOTICE HOW THE FUNCTION IS DECREASING AND CONCAVE UP.I HOPE YOU FOUND THIS HELPFUL .
