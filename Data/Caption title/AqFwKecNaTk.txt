A line has a slope of negative 3/4 and goes through the point0 comma 8.What is the equation of this line in slope-intercept form ? So any line can be represented in slope-intercept form , isy is equal to mx plus b , where this m right over here , that is of the slope of the line.And this b over here , this is the y-intercept of the line.Let me draw a quick line here just sothat we can visualize that a little bit.So that is my y-axis.And then that is my x-axis.And let me draw a line.And since our line here has a negative slope , I 'll draw a downward sloping line.So let 's say our line looks something like that.So hopefully , we 're a little familiar with the slopealready.The slope essentially tells us , look , start at some point on the line , and goto some other point of the line , measurehow much you had to move in the x direction , that is your run , and then measure how much you hadto move in the y direction , that is your rise.And our slope is equal to rise over run.And you can see over here , we 'd be downward sloping.Because if you move in the positive x direction , we have to go down.If our run is positive , our rise here is negative.So this would be a negative over a positive , it would give you a negative number.That makes sense , because we 're downward sloping.The more we go down in this situation , for every step we move to the right , the more downward sloping will be , the more of a negative slope we 'll have.So that 's slope right over here.The y-intercept just tells us where we intercept the y-axis.So the y-intercept , this point right over here , this is where the line intersects with the y-axis.This will be the point 0 comma b.And this actually just falls straight out of this equation.When x is equal to 0 -- so let 's evaluatethis equation , when x is equal to 0.y will be equal to m times 0 plus b.Well , anything times 0 is 0.So y is equal to 0 plus b , or y willbe equal to b , when x is equal to 0.So this is the point 0 comma b.Now , they tell us what the slope of this line is.They tell us a line has a slope of negative 3/4.So we know that our slope is negative 3/4 , and they tell us that the line goes through the point0 comma 8.They tell us we go through the -- Let me just , in a new color.I 've already used orange , let me use this green color.They tell us what we go through the point 0 comma 8.Notice , x is 0.So we 're on the y-axis.When x is 0 , we're on the y-axis.So this is our y-intercept.So b , we could say -- we could do a couple -- our y-intercept isthe point 0 comma 8 , or we could say that b -- Remember , it 's also 0 comma b.We could say b is equal to 8.So we know m is equal to negative 3/4 , b is equal to 8 , so we can write the equation of this linein slope-intercept form.It 's y is equal to negative 3/4 times x plus b , plus 8.And we are done .
