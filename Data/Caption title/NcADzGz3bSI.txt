It never hurts to get a lot of practice , so in this video I'mjust going to do a bunch more of essentially , what we calllong division problems.And so if you have 4 goes into 2,292.And I do n't know exactly why they call it long division , and we saw this in the last video a little bit.I did n't call it long division then , but I think the reasonwhy is it takes you a long time or it takes a longpiece of your paper.As you go along , you kind of have this thing , this long tailthat develops on the problem.So all of those are , at least , reasons in my head whyit 's called long division.But we saw in the last video there 's a way to tackle anydivision problem while just knowing your multiplicationtables up to maybe 10 times 10 or 12 times 12.But just as a bit of review , this is the same thingas 2,292 divided by 4.And it 's actually the same thing , and you probably haven'tseen this notation before , as 2,292 divided by 4.This , this , and this are all equivalent statementson some level.And you could say , hey Sal , that looks like a fractionin case you have seen fractions already.And that is exactly what it is.It is a fraction.But anyway , I 'll just focus on this format and in futurevideos we 'll think about other ways to represent division.So let 's do this problem.So 4 goes into 2 how many times ? It goes into 2 no times , so let 's move on to -- letme just switch colors.So let 's move on to the 22.4 goes into 22 how many times ? Let 's see.4 times 5 is equal to 20.4 times 6 is equal to 24.So 6 is too much.So 4 goes into 22 five times.5 times 4 is 20.There 's going to be a little bit of a leftover.And then we subtract 22 minus 20.Well that 's just 2.And then you bring down this 9.And you saw in the last video exactly what this means.When you wrote this 5 up here -- notice we wrotein the 100 's place.So this is really a 500.But in this video I 'm just going to focus more on theprocess , and you can think more about what it actually meansin terms of where I'm writing the numbers.But I think the process is going to be crystalclear hopefully , by the end of this video.So we brought down the 9.4 goes into 29 how many times ? It goes into at least six times.What 's 4 times 7 ? 4 times 7 is 28.So it goes into it at least seven times.What 's 4 times 8 ? 4 times 8 is 32 , so it ca n't go into it eight times so it'sgoing to go into it seven.4 goes into 29 nine seven times.7 times 4 is 28.29 minus 28 to get our remainder for this stepin the problem is 1.And now we 're going to bring down this 2.We 're going to bring it down and you get a 12.4 goes into 12 ? That 's easy.4 times 3 is 12.4 goes into 12 three times.3 times 4 is 12.12 minus 12 is 0.We have no remainder.So 4 goes into 2,292 exactly 573 times.So this 2,292 divided by 4 we can say is equal to 573.Or we could say that this thing right here is equal to 573.Let 's do a couple of more.Let 's do a few more problems.So I 'll do that red color.Let 's say we had 7 going into 6,475.Maybe it 's called long division because you write it nice andlong up here and you have this line.I do n't know.There 's multiple reasons why it could be called long division.So you say 7 goes into 6 zero times.So we need to keep moving forward.So then we go to 64.7 goes into 64 how many times ? Let 's see.7 times 7 is ? Well , that 's way too small.Let me think about it a little bit.Well 7 times 9 is 63.That 's pretty close.And then 6 times 10 is going to be too big.7 times 10 is 70.So that 's too big.So 7 goes into 64 nine times.9 times 7 is 63.64 minus 63 to get our remainder of this stage 1.Bring down the 7.7 goes into 17 how many times ? Well , 7 times 2 is 14.And then 7 times 3 is 21.So 3 is too big.So 7 goes into 17 two times.2 times 7 is 14.17 minus 14 is 3.And now we bring down the 5.And 7 goes into 35 ? That 's in our 7 multiplication tables , five times.5 times 7 is 35.And there you go.So the remainder is zero.So all the examples I did so far had no remainders.Let 's do one that maybe might have a remainder.And to ensure it has a remainder I 'll justmake up the problem.It 's much easier to make problems that have remaindersthan the ones that do n't have remainders.So let 's say I want to divide 3 into -- I 'm going to divide itinto , let 's say 1,735,092.This will be a nice , beastly problem.So if we can do this we can handle everything.So it 's 1,735,092.That 's what we're dividing 3 into.And actually , I 'm not sure if this will have a remainder.In the future video I 'll show you how to figure out whethersomething is divisible by 3.Actually , we can do it right now.We can just add up all these digits.1 plus 7 is 8.8 plus 3 is 11.11 5 five is 16.16 plus 9 is 25.25 plus 2 is 27.So actually , this number is divisible by 3.So if you add up all of the digits , you get 27.And then you can add up those digits -- 2 plus 7 is 9.So that is divisible by 9.That 's a trick that only works for 3.So this number actually is divisible by 3.So let me change it a little bit , so it'snot divisible by 3.Let me make this into a 1.Now this number will not be divisible by 3.I definitely want a number where I 'll endup with a remainder.Just so you see what it looks like.So let 's do this one.3 goes into 1 zero times.So we can just move forward.You could write a 0 here and multiply that out , but thatjust makes it a little bit messy in my head.So we just move one to the right.3 goes into 17 how many times ? Well , 3 times 5 is equal to 15.And 3 times 6 is equal to 18 and that 's too big.So 3 goes into 17 right here five times.5 times 3 is 15.And we subtract.17 minus 15 is 2.And now we bring down this 3.3 goes into 23 how many times ? Well , 3 times 7 is equal to 21.And 3 times 8 is too big.That 's equal to 24.So 3 goes into 23 seven times.7 times 3 is 21.Then we subtract.23 minus 21 is 2.Now we bring down the next number.We bring down the 5.I think you can appreciate why it 's called long division now.We bring down this 5.3 goes into 25 how many times ? Well , 3 times 8 gets you pretty close and 3 times 9 is too big.So it goes into it eight times.8 times 3 is 24.I 'm going to run out of space.You subtract , you get 1.25 minus 24 is 1.Now we can bring down this 0.And you get 3 goes into 10 how many times ? That 's easy.It goes into it three times.3 times 3 is 9.That 's about as close to 10 as we can get.3 times 3 is 9.10 minus 9 , I 'm going to have to scroll up anddown here a little bit.10 minus 9 is 1 , and then we can bring down the next number.I 'm running out of colors.I can bring down that 9.3 goes into 19 how many times ? Well , 6 is about as close as we can get.That gets us to 18.3 goes into 19 six times.6 times 3 -- let me scroll down.6 times 3 is 18.19 minus 18 -- we subtract it up here too.19 minus 18 is 1 and then we 're almost done.I can revert back to the pink.We bring down this 1 right there.3 goes into 11 how many times ? Well , that 's three times because 3 times 4 is too big.3 times 4 is 12 , so that 's too big.So it goes into it three times.So 3 goes into 11 three times.3 times 3 is 9.And then we subtract and we get a 2.And there 's nothing left to bring down.When we look up here there's nothing left to bringdown , so we 're done.So we 're left with the remainder of 2 after doingthis entire problem.So the answer , 3 goes into 1,735,091 -- it goes intoit 578,363 remainder 2.And that remainder 2 was what we got all the way down there.So hopefully you now appreciate and you can tackle prettymuch any division problem.And you also , through this exercise , can appreciate whyit 's called long division . test
