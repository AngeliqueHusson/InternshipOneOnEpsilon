get welcome tech math channel gon na look video gon na sort culmination looking looking atour head basically complex operation yeah weve loo ked multiplying dividing loo ked also look simplify ing theres video probably really really good havent seen yet basically show couple thing first third theyre type number gently expressed root another thing number root number say something like square root square root three weve worked third third multiplication worked third could say something like square root times square root b equal square root times bass square root say three times square root two square root six divided thing going write particular found term surge could added example say something like square root three times square root plus four times square root end upwith say seven times square root could directly added like also found could actually simplify certain number square root sign factor perfect square perfect square well say something like squared go previous video get understand already fine next thing gon na talk even begin recommend go look let bit look type question looking type question say could say something like square root five gon na multiplying bite something bracket twice square root three nice simple start follow snow fairly simple multiply number number number matter expanding bracket gon na start fairly basic complex equal square root five times two going add square root buy square root actually take little bit two times square root square root times square root square root times square root equal multiply since equal square root cant simplify answer know third sometimes doesnt feel like youve actually got answer answer cant actually get factor gon na work really nicely well thats thats right look harder type question particular one say one square root three time two plus square root three follow gon na expand try simplify first gon na multiply two term know multiply two term gon na first square root three times two gon na square root three times square root three might square root three times square root three actually three answer going two times square root three plus gon na give one example arent arent bad take little get used say times square root two going multiply square root six bracket stake away square root three nasty looking one yeah get follow going go times square root first going multiply number set square root taking away times square multiplying swear stuck far take cant way follow multiply guy gon na seven multiply straight one one seven square root well gon na taking away times square root multiply six multiply get sort answer get well might remember perfect square idea one doesnt factor ago one one four three actually take even say equal seven times square root four times three take away seven times square root six take little bit square root two becomes two year times seven times square root three taking away seven times square root six yeah moment cant go leave go answer easiest thing ever think find little little bit tricky often hard know stop thing u h head hopefully youve done right anyway hopefully help anyway see next time surd radical basic made easy radical math surd radical basic made easy radical math surd radical basic made easy radical math surd radical basic made easy radical math surd radical basic made easy radical math surd radical basic made easy radical math surd radical basic made easy radical math surd radical basic made easy radical math surd radical basic made easy radical math surd radical basic made easy radical math surd radical basic made easy radical math surd radical basic made easy radical math surd radical basic made easy radical math surd radical basic made easy radical math surd radical basic made easy radical math surd radical basic made easy radical math surd radical basic made easy radical math surd radical basic made easy radical math
