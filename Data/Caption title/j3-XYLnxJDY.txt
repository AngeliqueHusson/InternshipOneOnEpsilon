So right here , we have a four-sided figure , or a quadrilateral , where two of the sidesare parallel to each other.And so this , by definition , is a trapezoid.And what we want to do is , given the dimensionsthat they 've given us , what is the area of this trapezoid.So let 's just think through it.So what would we get if we multiplied this long base6 times the height 3 ? So what do we get if we multiply 6 times 3 ? Well , that would be the area of a rectangle thatis 6 units wide and 3 units high.So that would give us the area of a figure thatlooked like -- let me do it in this pink color.The area of a figure that looked like this would be 6 times 3.So it would give us this entire area right over there.Now , the trapezoid is clearly less than that , but let 's just go with the thought experiment.Now , what would happen if we went with 2 times 3 ? Well , now we 'd be finding the area of a rectangle thathas a width of 2 and a height of 3.So you could imagine that being this rectangle right over here.So that is this rectangle right over here.So that 's the 2 times 3 rectangle.Now , it looks like the area of the trapezoidshould be in between these two numbers.Maybe it should be exactly halfway in between , because when you look at the area difference between the tworectangles -- and let me color that in.So this is the area difference on the left-hand side.And this is the area difference on the right-hand side.If we focus on the trapezoid , yousee that if we start with the yellow , the smaller rectangle , it reclaims half of the area , halfof the difference between the smaller rectangleand the larger one on the left-hand side.It gets exactly half of it on the left-hand side.And it gets half the difference between the smallerand the larger on the right-hand side.So it completely makes sense that the areaof the trapezoid , this entire area right over here , should really just be the average.It should exactly be halfway between the areasof the smaller rectangle and the larger rectangle.So let 's take the average of those two numbers.It 's going to be 6 times 3 plus 2 times 3 , all of that over 2.So when you think about an area of a trapezoid , you look at the two bases , the long base and the short base.Multiply each of those times the height , and then youcould take the average of them.Or you could also think of it as thisis the same thing as 6 plus 2.And I 'm just factoring out a 3 here.6 plus 2 times 3 , and then all of that over 2 , which is the same thing as -- and I'mjust writing it in different ways.These are all different ways to think about it -- 6 plus 2 over 2 , and then that times 3.So you could view it as the averageof the smaller and larger rectangle.So you multiply each of the bases times the heightand then take the average.You could view it as -- well , let 's just add up the two baselengths , multiply that times the height , and then divide by 2.Or you could say , hey , let's take the average of the twobase lengths and multiply that by 3.And that gives you another interesting wayto think about it.If you take the average of these two lengths , 6 plus 2 over 2is 4.So that would be a width that looks somethinglike -- let me do this in orange.A width of 4 would look something like this.A width of 4 would look something like that , and you 're multiplying that times the height.Well , that would be a rectangle like this that is exactlyhalfway in between the areas of the smalland the large rectangle.So these are all equivalent statements.Now let 's actually just calculate it.So we could do any of these.6 times 3 is 18.This is 18 plus 6 , over 2.That is 24/2 , or 12.You could also do it this way.6 plus 2 is 8 , times 3 is 24 , divided by 2 is 12.6 plus 2 divided by 2 is 4 , times 3 is 12.Either way , the area of this trapezoid is 12 square units . test
