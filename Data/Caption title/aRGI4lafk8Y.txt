inscribed angles are different fromcentral angles because their vertex ison this is on the circle so if I were todraw on two radii which would form acentral angle AOC there 's a specialrelationship between the central angleand this inscribed angle when they sharethe same intercepted arc from A to C andthat special relationship is written inthese two equations first one says thatthis inscribed angle ABC is equal tohalf of this central angle AOC anotherway of saying that is in terms of theintercepted arc if we have anintercepted arc AC its measure is goingto be twice as much as the interceptedarc prior to flip that around this isgoing to be half of the intercepted arcthe second key thing about inscribedangles are when they intercept the samemark so here we have one inscribed angleits vertex is on the circle and I havetwo endpoints one right here and oneright here and if I were to pick arandom point somewhere on this circleand draw in two chords to where theendpoints of the other inscribed angleare so now we 've created two inscribedangles that have the same interceptedarc if they have the same interceptedarc then they must be congruent sothat 's going to be helpful when you'retrying to problem-solve when you haveinscribed angles and remember the otherkey thing is that an inscribed angle isequal to half of its central angle andhalf of the intercepted arc test
