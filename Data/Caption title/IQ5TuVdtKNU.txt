hey how 's it going for this video we'regonna work on finding the signs ofdifferent training metric functionsusing a wonderful neat little tool thatI picked up when I was in school alrightso you may have seen this before maybenot but this is actually a great waythat you can easily memorize whethersomething like sine or cosine should bepositive or negative that 's what I meanby the signs of the trigonometricfunctions so let 's learn this real quickand see exactly what information itgives us so when you 're doing differenttrigonometric functions like sine of 23degrees you get a number and the idea isis this thing going to be positive ornegative and the clue to really figureout well is it positive or negative isdepending on where that angle ends up isthat in quadrant one quadrant twoquadrant three or quadrant four if youknow what quadrant it 's going to be inthen you can easily figure out what thesine is going to be now these lettershere tell you which triggertrigonometric functions are going to bepositive or negative for example if myangle ends up in this first quadrantthen all the trigonometric functions aregoing to be positive so if I 'm dealingwith sine of 23 degrees sure enoughthat 's in the first quadrant oh I knowthat 's going to be a positive value whenI get over here to quadrant number twothen I know that sine and it'sreciprocal are going to be positive whatabout the rest what about tangent andcosine those will be negative so theseare telling me what values are whattrigonometric functions are going to bepositive so sine and it 's reciprocalwhat you know what we 'll go ahead andwrite out cosecant will also be theother positive one all right moving onwhose going to be positive in the thirdquadrant well T we do n't have onetrigonometric function that starts withT that 's our tangent and if you want toremember cotangent is the other one sotangent and it 's reciprocal and then thelast one who gets to be positive overhere cosine and it 's reciprocal functionsecantso now that you know which functionswill be positive in which quadrant howcan you remember this really quicklywell a great mnemonic for this is toremember that all students take calculusand you mark them off in the order ofthe quadrants so quadrant one is allquadrant two is students quadrant threeis take and quadrant four is ourcalculus so all students take calculusand now you know which turn metricfunctions are associated with them nowlet 's take this one step further andactually try an example now that we havethis wonderful little thing down andjust out this out I 'm gon na draw this inthe corner which is something you can doif you 're taking a quick test orsomething you know quickly sketch thisout so all students take calculus we'lluse that to help us figure out what'sgoing on so the goal with this problemhere is to figure out what quadrant ourangle has ended up in and the only thingwe know is a little bit about the sineof the functions so I know that if Iplug my angle into sine its negative andif I plug my angle into tangent it itturns out to be positive so where didthat angle go well if I know that sineis negative then I immediately can ruleout the first and second quadrantbecause in the first quadranteveryone 's positive and then the secondquadrant sine is positive and Ispecifically know it 's negative so it'sgot to be on this lower half here I'mgonna shade that in so so far our anglehas to be down here somewhere now thenext bit of information is that tangentis positive so let 's see where 's tangentpositive wells positive in the firstquadrant that 's positive in the thirdquadrant so two bits so it could be hereor it could be down herenow there 's only one quadrant where bothof these things are happening and sureenough that is quadrant number three sowhat quadrant is my angling I can saythetais in Quadrant three so this reallygives you information or a little hintabout that angle let 's do it again sothis time cosine is negative andcosecant is positive so Co cosine isnegative so that rules out those two ineed where it 's negative so i know thatit has to be over on this side somewhereover here so that cosine is negativecosecant greater than zero now I have tobe carefulthis is stands for all trigonometricfunctions sine tangent and cosine orworse where 's cosecant is ko seeing itup here you also have to remember thatthese apply to their reciprocalidentities so cosecant is the reciprocalof sine so cosecant of angle is equal toone of the words sine of the angle soI 'm gon na use so it has to have the samesign as sine of the angle so where issine positive sine is positiveup on the upper half here so let 's shadein the upper half all right now justlike before there 's only one place whereboth of these conditions happensimultaneously and now I know where myangle is theta is in Quadrant number twoso you know do n't be afraid to writethis on your piece of paper if you needa quick reference and it really givesyou a lot of intuition on the the signthat these trigonometric functionsshould have all right if you 'd like tosee some more videos please
