today I want to do a video response Iresponse to one of our own numberphilevideos because some time ago Brady madea video with our numberphile composerAlan Stuart 's it was a video it was 40minutes long this video which was a testto our loyalty I think but in that videohave you made it through alan describedcomposing one of his pieces about theFibonacci sequence it involved theFibonacci sequence and he came up with aquestion as a challenge I guess to thenumber files I 'm not quite good enoughin laughs to be able to explain why thatis maybe a number file will be able toexplain like this I 'm going to answerhis question todayso what Alan was doing was he was tryingto involve the Fibonacci sequence in apiece of music so first let 's have arecap of the Fibonacci sequence veryimportant sequence in mathematics it'squite easy it starts with 1 then it 's 1again and then you add the previous 2value so you add these two and you getthe next number so that 's just 1 plus 1equals 2 then you add these two valuesthat 's 1 plus 2 equals 3 then you addthe previous 2 that 's 2 plus 3 equals 5and you keep going in this way 6760 5and so on okay so there 's the Fibonaccisequence and what Allan was doing was toturn this into a piece of music he wasdividing by 7 he 's going to divide allthese Fibonacci numbers by 7now you ca n't divide exactly by 7 mostof the time and so he looked at theremainder what you get left over whenyou divide by 7 that 's one that 's twothat 's three that 's 5 now 8 when youdivide 8 by 7 that 's one with one leftover that 's what he wrote down then 13divided by 7 is 1 with 6 left over 21divided by 7 is 3 exactly it has zeroleft over so you write zero and we'regoing to continue in that way we'regoing to do all the remainders so hewrote out all the remainders I need tomake it a piece of music he turned tothese remainders into musical notes soit corresponds to notes but he didn'tnotice a pattern when he did itcuriously he found the pattern repeatedit actually repeated every 16 numbers sohere we go 1 1 2 3 5 1 6 0 6 6 5 4 - 6 10 1 1 2 3 and then the pattern repeatedand he asked what is this about is thisa thing and it is a thing it 's actuallycalled a Poisson Oh Pierrepisano period is named after LeonardoPisano and if you think you haven'theard of him before are you wrongbecause that 's just another name ofFibonacci so this is a pisano period nowAllen chose seven to do this becausethat helps him make his musical notes ifyou 'd pick any number though he wouldhave got up here as well but the lengthof the period would have been differentso he divided by 2/3 divided by 90 or700 he would have got a cyclic patternif we divide by 5 as an example thisshould be quite easy divided by 5 thisis when I 'll make a mistake 1 1 2 leftover 3 divided by 3 5 plus 3 left over 5divided by 5 is 0 0 left over 8 dividedby 5 is a 1 a 3 left over would be a 3 4left over that 's one left over a 0 leftover and I think that 's actually thefull pattern and the when you divide by5 the period is 20 so this is the wholething here at this point it will startto repeat again the zeros I want topoint out are interesting the zeros arewhen you can divide by 5 exactly sothere 's a 0 here there 's a 0 here thisis 0 here as well oh look at this nolook I just noticed that laser mistake Isaid that look I said this had aremainder of 5 but look I do n't needthis that has a remainder of 0 that justshows you doing it all alive I I 'm doingit up now I noticed that that was amistake I noticed there was a problemthere because I knew that the period hasonly can only have one zero two zeros orfour so that 's another result inmathematics so because there was three Iknew there was a problem there and Ifound it so that 's another example ofthe Pisanoperiod if you another thing I want topoint out then it 's actually every fifthnumber every fitnah but there is a thereis a proper bit ofit 's behind this room actually do itthere 's another result about Fibonaccinumbers it says a Fibonacci number let'scall it the nth Fibonacci numberexactly divided which I use a verticalline for another Fibonacci number whichI 'm going to call FM the result is ifand only if n divides M so the littleindex at the bottom here if they dividethen the Fibonacci numbers divide aswell just to give you an example then wewere doing if we look at the fifthFibonacci number that is equal to 5 soso 5 divides Fibonacci numbers if andonly if there 's a little symbol there 5divides the value of the index so everyfifth number every 5th Fibonacci numberis divisible by 5 that 's what I choselet me just do one more example of thatto make the point I took the next onelook the 6th Fibonacci number is 8 so 8will divide Fibonacci numbers exactlywhen 6 that 's the index here divides Mso every sixth number every sixthFibonacci number is divisible by 8 sothis Pisano period idea was firstdiscovered by a mathematician calledLagrange in 1774 and he was actuallylooking at the patterns when you divideby 10 when he divide by 10 what you haveleft over it 's just the last digit let'sdo a quick version of that what colorsdo I need now I have to use black 5 8 13divided by 10 is 1 with 3 left over 21divided by 10 has 1 left overand what he discovered was the they had8 they did have a pattern and thepattern had a period of 60 so the lastdigits of the Fibonacci sequence have apattern of length 60 if you divide by ahundred then you 're actually looking atthe last two digits of the Fibonaccisequence that has a pattern of 300lengths 300 if you look at the lastthree digits that 's dividing by athousandthat has a pattern of length 1,500 theother easy way to do this is you don'thave to write out the Fibonacci sequenceand do each calculation for each numberactually there 's a property of theseremainders that you can just add up theprevious two remainders let 's have alook so if we look at an example likehere this is when I was dividing by 7for the remainder of 4 plus a remainderof 2 gives me the next remainder it'sjust like the Fibonacci sequence givesme a remainder of 6 remainder of 2 plusa remainder of 6 it actually wraps backbecause we 're dividing by 7 when you gopast 7 it wraps back to 0 so this willtake me back to 1 then 6 plus 1 willgive me 7 which wraps back to 0 so alackI can actually do these sequences bysimply adding up the remainders so usingthis idea when you add the previous tworemainders gives you the next oneactually kind of explains what 's goingon when I had a 1 and a 0 here next toeach other then when I add them togetherI get a 1 then I add 0 plus 1 and I getanother one so I 've got 2 ones in a row1 and 1 and then that 's the beginning ofthe Fibonacci sequence and then it justcarries on so whenever you have a 0 nextto a 1 you 're going to end up back intothe Fibonacci so you 're going to end upback to the start of the Fibonaccisequence and it has been shown that thiswill always happen so that 0 1 is like abig trigger point yeah yeah that 's goingto send you back to the start again andthat will happen in the other sequencesthat we had here as well look this isthe dividing by 5 it has a period of 20that 's the end of it and there 's the 0and the 1 again and that 's going to sendyou back to the start so you 're alwaysgoing to end up back to the start thisperiod is always going to repeat howeverthere is no general formula for thelength of the period so that 's somethingwe do n't know yetthat two boxes of nine and a box of sixthere we go that makes 44 Fibonacci Mystery - Numberphile Fibonacci
