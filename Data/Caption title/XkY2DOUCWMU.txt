experience proof matrices one throw matrices e mil last left sho wed linear transformation look like represent matrices worth quick recap really important course like recap go back watch full video technically speaking linear transformation function vector input sand vector sho wed last time think visually around space way stay parallel evenly origin remains fixed key take away linear transformation completely determined take basis vector space two dimension mean hat vector describe linear combination basis vector sa vector x yis x times hat times going transformation property grid remain parallel evenly wonderful consequence place vector land x times version hat times version mean keep record hat land sand j hat compute vector start x land x times new hat times new convention record hat j hat column matrix define sum scaled version column x matrix vector multiplication matrix represent specific linear transformation multiplying matrix vector mean apply transformation vector alright recap onto new stuff oftentimes find wanting describe effect apply ing one transformation another example maybe want describe happen first rotate plane counterclockwise apply shear overall effect start another linear transformation distinct rotation shear new linear transformation commonly cal led composition two separate transformation applied like linear transformation describe matrix following hat example ultimate landing spot transformation let make first column matrix likewise j hat ultimately end location make second column matrix new matrix capture overall effect apply ing rotation sheer one single action rather two successive one way think new matrix take vector pump rotation sheer long way compute end first multiply left rotation matrix take whatever get multiply left sheer matrix numerically speaking mean apply rotation sheer given vector whatever get apply ing new composition matrix found vector matter vector chose since new matrix supposed capture overall effect action based thing written think reasonable call new matrix product original two matrices dont think compute product generally moment way easy get lost forest remember multiplying two matrices like geometric meaning apply ing one transformation another one thing thats weird reading right left first apply transformation matrix right apply transformation matrix left stem function notation since write function left every time compose two function always read right left good news brew bad news rest look another example take matrix column transformation look like let call take matrix column transformation look like let call guy total effect apply ing us new transformation let find matrix time let see without watching animation sand instead numerical matrix first need figure hat goes apply ing new definition given first column see happen apply ing matrix vector way describe last get vector first column composition matrix likewise follow second column tell us first land apply vector work matrix vector product get becomes second column composition matrix let talk process time ill show variable matrix show line reasoning works matrices symbol heavy require room pretty satisfying anyone previously taught matrix multiplication rote way follow hat goes start looking first column matrix right since hat initially column matrix left tell intermediate version hat end second transformation first column composition matrix always equal left matrix times first column right matrix likewise j hat always initially land second column right matrix multiplying left matrix second column give final location hence thats second column composition matrix notice theres lot symbol common taught formula something memorize along certain algorithmic process kind help remember really think process get habit thinking matrix multiplication really one transformation another trust give much better conceptual framework make matrix multiplication much easier understand example question matter order put two matrices multiply well let think simple example like one shear fix es hat j hat right rotation first shear rotate see hat end j hat end generally pointing close together first rotate end j hat different direction theyre pointing know farther apart overall effect clearly different evidently order totally matter notice thinking term kind thing head matrix multiplication necessary remember first took linear algebra theres one homework problem ked us prove matrix multiplication mean three matrices b cand multiply together shouldnt matter first compute times b multiply result cor first multiply b times c multiply result left word doesnt matter put parentheses try work numerically like back horrible horrible unenlightening matter think matrix multiplication apply ing one transformation another property trivial see saying first apply c b apply ing c b ai mean theres nothing apply ing three thing one order might feel like cheating proof matrix multiplication associative even better good explanation property true really encourage play around two different happen apply one working matrix product numerically trust kind play time really make idea sink next video ill start talking extending beyond two matrix multiplication composition essence linear algebra chapter matrix multiplication composition essence linear
