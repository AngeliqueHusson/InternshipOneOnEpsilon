We are asked to approximate the principal root , or the positive square root of 45 , to the hundredths place.And I 'm assuming they don't want us to use a calculator.Because that would be too easy.So , let 's see if we can approximate this justwith our pen and paper right over here.So the square root of 45 , or the principal root of 45.45 is not a perfect square.It 's definitely not a perfect square.Let 's see , what are the perfect squares around it ? We know that it is going to be lessthan -- the next perfect square above 45is going to be 49 because that is 7 times 7 -- so it 's less than the square root of 49and it 's greater than the square root of 36.And so , the square root of 36 , the principal root of 36I should say , is 6.And the principal root of 49 is 7.So , this value right over here is going to be between 6 and 7.And if we look at it , it's only four away from 49.And it 's nine away from 36.So , the different between 36 and 49 is 13.So , it 's a total 13 gap between the 6 squared and 7 squared.And this is nine of the way through it.So , just as a kind of approximation maybe -- and it'snot going to work out perfectly because we 're squaring it , this is n't a linear relationship -- but it 's going to be closer to 7 than it 's going to be to 6.At least the 45 is 9/13 of the way.Let 's see.It looks like that's about 2/3 of the way.So , let 's try 6.7 as a guess just based on 0.7 is about 2/3.It looks like about the same.Actually , we could calculate this right here if we want.Actually , let 's do that just for fun.So 9/13 as a decimal is going to be what ? It 's going to be 13 into 9.We 're going to put some decimal places right over here.13 does n't go into 9 but 13 does go into 90.And it goes into 90 -- let's see , does it go into itseven times -- it goes into it six times.So , 6 times 3 is 18.6 times 1 is 6 , plus 1 is 7.And then you subtract , you get 12.So , went into it almost exactly seven times.So , this value right here is almost a 0.7.And so if you say , how many times does 13 go into 120 ? It looks like it's like nine times ? Yeah , it would go into it nine times.9 times 3.Get rid of this.9 times 3 is 27.9 times 1 is 9 , plus 2 is 11.You have a remainder of 3.It 's about 0.69.So 6.7 would be a pretty good guess.This is 0.69 of the way between 36 and 49.So , let 's go roughly 0.69 of the way between 6 and 7.So this is once again just to approximate.It 's not necessarily going to give us the exact answer.We have to use that to make a good initial guess.And then see how it works.Let 's try 6.7.And the really way to try it is to square 6.7.So 6.7 times -- maybe I'll write the multiplication symbolthere -- 6.7 times 6.7.So , we have 7 times 7 is 49.7 times 6 is 42 , plus 4 is 46.Put a 0 now because we've moved a space to the left.So , now we have 6 times 7 is 42.Carry the 4.6 times 6 is 36 , plus 4 is 40.And so , 9 plus 0 is 9.6 plus 2 is 8.4 plus 0 is 4.And then we have a 4 right over here.And we have two total numbers behind the decimal point.One , two.So this gives us 44.89.So , 6.7 gets us pretty close.But we 're still not probably right to the hundredth.Well , we 're definitely not to the hundredths place.This since we 've only gone to the tenths placeright over here.So , if we want to get to 45 , 6.7 squared is still less than 45 , or 6.7 is still less than the square root of 45.So let 's try 6.71.Let me do this in a new color.I 'll do 6.71 in pink.So , let 's try 6.71.Increase it a little bit.See if we go from 44.89 to 45.Because this is really close already.Let 's just try it out.6.71.So once again , we have to do some arithmetic by hand.We are assuming that they do n't wantus to use a calculator here.So , we have 1 times 1 is 1.1 times 7 is 7.1 times 6 is 6.Put a 0 here.7 times 1 is 7.7 times 7 is 49.7 times 6 is 42 , plus 4 is 46.And then we have two 0s here.6 times 1 is 6.6 times 7 is 42.Just have this new 4 here.6 times 6 is 36 , plus 4 is 40.Plus 40.It 's interesting to think what we got incrementallyby adding that one hundredth over there.Well , we 'll see actually when we add all of this up.You get a 1.7 plus 7 is 14.1 plus 6 plus 9 is 16 , plus 6 is 22.2 plus 6 plus 2 is 10.And then 1 plus 4 is 5.And then we bring down the 4.And we have one , two , three , fournumbers behind the decimal point.One , two , three , four.So , when you we squared 6.71.6.71 squared is equal to 45.0241.So 6.71 is a little bit greater.So , let me make it clear now.We know that 6.7 is less than the square root of 45.And we know that is less than 6.71.Because when we square this , we get something a little bitover the square root of 45.But the key here is when we square this , so 6.7 squaredgot us 44.89 which is 0.11 away from 45.And then , if we look at 6.71 squared , we 're only 2.4 hundredths above 45.So , this right here is closer to the square root of 45.So if we approximate to the hundredths place , definitely want to go with 6.71 .
