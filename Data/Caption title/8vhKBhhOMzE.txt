next we are gon na write some fractionsas decimals and vice verse 37thousandths you should be able to tellby now you need three decimal digits soyou need to put 37 right there how about37 hundredths this time you will needtwo decimal digits so the 37 goes likethatthe last one is easy right 16000 0.016okay a decimal and write that as afraction if you can read it then you canwrite it as a fraction too and byreading I do n't mean read it like 0.05to read it as 50 mm right there arethree decimal digits and that meansthousands this last one we can write itas a mixed number or as a fraction as amixed number it is one here so I wouldhave one as my whole number path then tozero for two hundred four thousandsright I 'm gon na write it as a fractionas well if I write it as a fraction thedenominator is still one thousand isthree decimal digits are signifying the1000 then I will just write this wholething in here in the top one two zerofour one thousand two hundred fourthousandths next we are going to comparesome decimals the first comparison isthis 0.007 and zero point zero sevenwhich one is more are they equal youknow some students think these twodecimals are equal because they bothseem to have the sting of seven on theother side of the decimal point butthat 's wrong as you can guess let'swrite these two numbers into the placevalue chart to see how they comparemethods can be your turn okayokay you got it right here but a littlesloppynow we 're gon na compare these twonumbers place by place starting here atthe ones place okay they have the samenumber of ones they need the tenthsplace they have the same number oftenths but in the hundredths place theseven hundredths was that 's none here sothis is where this bottom number wins soto speak okayit is the bigger number now you mightask what about the thousandswell they do n't count because youremember ten thousandths would make onehundred if her ten here then I would getone hundred here but this is less thanten so these seven thousands are lessthan one hundred so they do n't countwhen there are some hundredths here witha more hundredths here than here thenthis number is bigger there 's alsoanother way you can easily see this andthat is if I place a zero hereoh here and I read this number as 70,000then obviously it is more than seventhousandslet 's compare some more over here I haveeight point zero two two eight pointzero zero two okay both of them are ofthe same length so to speak or they havethe same number of decimal digits herewe have eight then we have 22 20 mm andmm so that 's easy right obviously 22 ismodern too then over here eight pointtwo to eight point two to zero can youtell now which one is more again somestudents think that this must be morebecause there 's 220 versus 22 but I'mgonna use my trick and put 0 here sothat we have three decimals here andthree decimals here right this does notchange the value of the number okay andnow you can see they are equal they areequal in valuehow about you again it might look likethat 114 is more than four but youcannot compare that way that 's the wrongway that 's a misconception I can use mytrick and put zeros here in thehundredths and thousandths places andread these numbers nine and four hundredthousandths and this one has nine and114 thousandths so easythis one is more the last one you can beyourself right pretty easytango zero there and now we can see that750,000 is the greater number okaywe 're all done with this one test
