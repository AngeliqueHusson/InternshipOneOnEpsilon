Write 7/8 as a decimal.And so the main realization here isthat 7/8 is the same thing as 7 divided by 8 , which is the same thing as 7 divided by 8.These are all different ways of writing the same thing.So let 's actually divide 8 into 7.And I 'll do it down here just so I have some more real estateto work with.I 'm going to divide 8 into 7.And I 'm going to add a decimal point here , just because we know that this value isgoing to be less than 1.7/8 is less than 1.We 're going to have some digits to the rightof the decimal point.And let me put the decimal point right up here , right above the decimal point in 7.And then we start dividing.And now this really turns into a long division problem.And we just have to make sure we keep track of the decimal sign.So 8 goes into -- it does n't go into 7 at all , but it does go into 70.So 8 goes into 70 eight times.So it goes into 70 eight times.8 times 8 is 64.And then you subtract.70 minus 64 is 6.And then bring down another 0 because we stillhave a remainder.We want to get to the point that we have no remainders.Assuming that this thing does n't repeat forever.And there 's other ways we can deal with that.8 goes into 60 ? Well , let 's see.It does n't go into it eight times because that 's 64.8 goes into 60 seven times.7 times 8 is 56.And then we subtract again.60 minus 56 is 4.And now , we can bring down another 0 right over here.And 8 goes into 40 ? Well , it goes into 40 exactly five times.5 times 8 is 40.And we have nothing.We have nothing left over.And so we 're done.7 divided by 8 or 7/8 is equal to 7 divided by 8 , which is equal to 0.875.But I 'll put a leading 0 here just so it makes it clearthat this is where the decimal is.0.875.And we are done .
