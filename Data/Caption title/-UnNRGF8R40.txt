alright what I 'd like to do is show youhow to solve when we 're giving these twocircles alright so what we 're gon na talkabout with these two circles is there'sa relationship and there 's a couplethings we need to look at on a circleyou have your radius which is our rightand we also have what we call centralangle which we 'll call theta then whatyou do is we can develop a formula forus to find the arc length which we'llcall us and the relationship of theformula is arc length s is equal to yourradius times theta the one stipulationis you 've got to make sure that theta isin terms of radians so if I give youdegrees and for your thetamake sure you convert it to radiansright and the way we can convert it toradians is you know by using our ratioright to convert from degrees to radiansyou guys can use that ratio to multiplyout so let 's look at this problem herewe do n't have any units but what we dois we have a radius that 's at 75 and wehave an arc link that 's at 60 so I'mgoing to do is plug in the formula so Isay 60is equal to my radius which is 75 thetathen solve for theta we 'll divide by 75and sixteen divided by 75it is going to be pointing so you cansay theta equals point eight so that'sgoing to be point eight radians is themeasurement of theta all right andobviously you could say like that 's inthe negative direction but themeasurement of theta is point eight overhere we 're given our data which is oneand we 're given the arc length which isthree meters so my heart length is threemeters equals my radius which is onetimes of our sorrymy theta is the one times R so what isobviously are getting cool are threetherefore my radius for this is threemeters is this one they gave us units touse all rightquestions on that just used the formulaif you have our Clank plug it in if youhave your radius or theta just make sureif theta is in radiansyou 're just plugging in what values youget either the arc length which is thelength of the arc the other do they tellyou what the radius is in the heartpoint or they give you the radius andthe angle he 's doing exactly I just didthis one right doing it backwards butthis is exactly like I just did anotherhere I 'm going to show you guys thevideo where you guys everything yeah Find the sector length or angle using arc length formula Find the sector length or angle using arc length formula Find the sector length or angle using arc length formula
