alright like show solve giving alright gon na talk two circle relationship need look circle radius right also call central angle call theta develop formula us find arc length well call us relationship formula arc length equal radius times theta one stipulation got make sure theta term radian give theta make sure convert way convert know ratio right convert degree guy use ratio multiply let look problem n radius arc link plug formula equal radius theta solve theta divide sixteen divided going pointing say theta equal point eight thats going point eight radian measurement theta right obviously could say like negative direction measurement theta point eight given data one given arc length three heart length equal radius sorry theta one times r obviously getting cool three therefore radius one gave us touse used formula clank plug radius theta make sure theta plugging value get either arc length length arc tell radius heart point give radius angle exactly one right backwards exactly like another going show guy video guy everything yeah find sector length angle arc length formula find sector length angle arc length formula find sector length angle arc length formula find sector length angle arc length formula find sector length angle arc length formula
