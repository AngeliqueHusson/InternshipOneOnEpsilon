I got an Interesting number sequence.It 's the ' Kolakoski sequence'..and i 'm just going to write it out..and see if you can see why it might be interesting.We go , `` One '' '' Two '' .I 'm going to put a comma in.Two , twoOne , oneTwo ... ... OneTwoTwoSometimes , I like to call this the ReadySequence because it 's like : 1 2 2 1 1 2Testing ! Why is this interesting ? This kit carries over , like this..There 's going to be a pattern there and you might think : '' This is a really boring sequence because it 's got one 's and two 's '' and that's-that 's not even in any particular order ! But let 's look at the runs , because the numbers..Either coming in runs of One or Two , interestingly.So , this is a run of one because it 's just one `` 1 '' .So ... I 'll write a ' 1'.Here 's a run of ' 2 ' , because , there are two of them ... .and the run of ' 2 ' ... Oh , a run of ' 1 ' , a run of ' 1'.Oh , a run of ' 2 ' ... and have you noticed something very interesting ? This one starts with 1,2,2,1,1,2.and here ... 1,2,2,1,1,2 ... and this will ... Continue forever.In other words ... '' The sequence ... describes ... itself , by ... telling you the length of the run.It 's a very , very famous sequence.It 's one of the very first ones that was put in the ... 'Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences ' , so people just say it 's the kind of the 'Kolakoski Sequence ' and in fact , there are only two sequences that have this property ... and it 's this one ... and , this one.Which is the 'Kolakoski sequence ' without the ' 1'So , it begins 2,2,1,1,2,1,2,2 ... Brady : Do you know who 'Kolakoski ' was ? Bill.I think he 's called 'William '' 'William Kolakoski ' , and I know that ... He came up with this idea in the 1960s.It 's like , you 're sort of ... scratching your own back and the other hand 's coming there.It 's like a sort of 'Escher ' paintingbut done in numbers.So in the book that I did with Edmund HarrissWe , rather 'he did ' I would like to claim credit but I can not .He found a way of representing this , in a rather , sort of , beautiful way.We have the sequence start in the outer circle , so , the inner one is ... Describing The length of Run and obviously that therefore , becomes a continuation of the same sequence ... and then , within it , within it , within it.so rather than one sequence and then the other one referring to it , you have these kind ofconcentric rings of referring , referring , referring , and that 's kind of quite interesting , and quite fun andIf you do all the Twos one color and all the Ones another color , say one black or gray and then one white ... and then you get rid of all the numberswe 're going to get rid of all the numbers , then you see it 's this kind of quite , strikingBrady : But that 's all white , that is.This is all white , and that 's because , it 's a colouring book . ( Silly Brady ... ) Oh.well , you know , it 's a coloring Book but , if I had this , well I do have this , Well I do have this but if I was 'Not Me ' and I was given this , I 'm not Sure I would want to color itin because I think , actually thatwhat you get from contemplating it without color , and you see how it all fits in , is rather beautiful.and you 're looking at it and you 're seeing there are other patterns that you can see , so you 've got this , sort-of blob here.Kind of gets bigger and bigger and bigger because what 's happening , is that asthe ring gets smaller it happens further away , so you get this kind of Shift.Brady : Kolakoski sequence ? Not 'Kowalski ' , who , was n't there a 'Primal Scream ' did a song about that ? I think , I think , yeah , because he was-he was some famousSome filming the guy called 'Kowalski ' or something like that , anyway , but it was not him ! Of the mathematical things that you might want to investigate in the sequence is , are there more 1 's than 2 's ? No one knows . That is another unsolved problem.A bit like the Collatz Conjecturebut , you 'll be a lot less famous if you get this one.Like it , looks like it approaches 50 % ... in the limit.Brady : We do n't know.No , we do n't know.Brady : Greatness awaits.Now you might not be able to color things in as beautifully as Tif here but one thing you canalways make look beautiful Is a website and that 's thanks to Squarespace ; I use them myself all the time for multiple websites.Blogs , Shops and you should too .
