welcome the following is considered astandard part of the algebra 2curriculum and I 'm not really sure whybut here goes let 's graph affectedpolynomials and let 's do this asfollowers suppose you in one of thesenightmares situations I mean literallythat you came to the final exam forcourse but you just realized that younever actually attended the courseitself if you 've got to go to thelectures and suppose one of thequestions on this final exam is graphthe following polynomial which isfactored into these little linear termsso let 's do something like a X plus 10cubed times X plus 4 squared plus X plus2 to the fifth say times X minus fourthousand o to the six times X minus 8 tothe Isles be crazy 96th power alrighthere goes you did n't go to the coursebut nonetheless you 're faced withanswering this question can I sketch agraph of this function well just a groupfour points let 's do the following atleast draw a set of quarter taxes youknow it 's going to be some graph of somekind so here 's the x-axis and here 's they axis the vertical one now if I look atthis beast I can ask myself are thereany interesting x values and there aresome interesting x value is staring mein the face example i know if i put in xequals negative 10 this term becomes 0which gives the whole polynomial come 0so write a note right away i know at xequals negative 10 the graph crosses thex-axis again x equals negative 4 is aninteresting x value put a negative 4into this formula get something x 0 xsometimes or something again at negativefor the graph must cross the x-axis andalso at negative 2 so right now I feellike we 've got a few points withoutknowing anything x equals 4 isinteresting there 's another x interceptand x equals 8 is another interestingpoint so the graph crosses the x-axis ateach of those values great there 's astart so I guess the name of the gamenow is just to keep doing this try to beintelligent without really knowing whati 'm doing and see if i can build apicture of the graph this function justfrom basic cell seeing things outputting in clever choices of X gave methe x-intercepts ah let 's talk about they-intercept is it going to be positiveor negativewell it wo n't work too hard at this butsuppose I put in x equals zero thisfirst term is going to be positive 10cubed this next term is going to bepositive 4 squared this tear would befor positive fact anything to the sixthwill also be positive negative for thesix is a positive number and negative ato the 96 the post up so now at leastsay the y-intercept will be 10 cubedtimes 4 squared x to the fifth timesnegative for the 6 times negative a tothe 96 we 're going to be probably somehuge positive number so these do n't knowthe graph crosses the y-axis as somepositive value all right that was a goodtrick can I go further let 's try anotherinteresting value for x let 's go tosomething extreme what happens if i putx equals a million into this graph wellthis would be a million plus 10 cubethat 's positive this term would bepositive something squared is positiveand million plus 2 to the fifth bepositive when I egg million minus 4 willbe positive especially raised for thesixth power and million minus eight willbe positive special erase this 96 powersI only get this huge positive number soextreme values of x I know my graphwants to be a huge positive value itmust be going up like this let 's just beselling things out I 'm just trying to beclever without doing any work in factwhat 's another good of interesting xvalue how about the other extremesomehow x equals negative a million wellnow things are going to change slightlyif I put in negative a million this willbe negative million-plus 10-q the behuge negative number that 's actuallycubed that will now be negative this guywill be something squared or staypositive this guy with something to thefifth power it be a negative numbernegative a million plus 2 to the fifthpower changes this to negative negativemillion minus 4 or that 'll be a negativenumber but in six power is stillpositive negative million minus eight tothe 96 power be positive so the neteffect is i get negative x positive xnegative x politicians positive so withx equals negative a million i 'll have ahuge positive number so again the graphwants to go up and be huge and positiveat the other extreme all right I feellike I deserve half points right nowI 've graph this function I know acrossthe x-axis of these particular pointsthese five values on the x-axisI know it 's positive at the y interceptI must be huge and positive us to goextremely to the part of the right andwhat 's to be huge and positive us goextremely far to the left now if it wassome sense connect the dots but I 've gotto be a little careful I do n't reallyknow what 's going on between negative 10and negative 4 say so let me examinethis let 's choose a number that'sbetween these two let 's say I knownegative 6 or something that 's inbetween I wo n't actually evaluate thebeast but let me ask will the graph bepositive or negative if I 'm at somepoint like negative 6 that is betweennegative 10 negative 4 so here goes butI put a negative 6 into this first termthis will be a positive number that getscubed by put a negative 6 into thismiddle term second term that would be anegative number that gets squared theywill be positive negative 6 here plus 2is negative 4 to the fifth power that'sa negative number raised to the fifthpower will be negative negative 6 justminus 4 is negative 10 to the sixthpower will be positive whatever thisguy 's be positive fact not able to thinkabout this anything to the pods is evenpower it 's going to be positive positivepositive to think about those once againthey 're always positive terms but fornegative 6 which is between negative 10and 4 negative 4 I can see the wholething must be positive times positivetimes negative x positive positive itwants to be a negative number let 's tryanother value let 's try between negative3 and negative 2 well let 's try say asour negative for names you like negative3 this guy will be negative 3 plus 10that 'd be a positive number cubed willstill be positive this term somethingsquared is still positive middle termnegative 3 plus 2 this negative 1 to thefifth power will be negative stays thesame negative 3 to the sixth power isalways positive negative 3 minus 8 tothe Nemesis power always positive soagain it wants to be negative 2xnegative 4 and 2 well between negative 2and 4 well I 've already done it it wantsto be positive whoops I should n't put anegative one there that 's silly of mejust wants to be negative theretwixt four and eight let 's try I knowsix well this term wants to be positive16 cubed this term must be positive thatis always positive this term wants to besix plus two is eight eight to the fifthpower is positive put in six here thismiles to be positive that is alwayspositive put in six here i get negativetwo but the nicest power is positive thewhole thing wants to be positive andwhat about between eight and up tosomething extreme like see already itwants to be positive well there we go Ican tell that this graph wants to bouncebetween these zeros on the x interceptthese the only places work across thex-axis and wants to be positive at theregion 's I indicate and negative at theother regions so I can actually see whatthe graph has to look like there 's to besomething like this that starts offbeing negative in the negative extremesmust be hugely positive has to touch thex-axis at zero in fact it it wants to benegative next certains to cut throughthe x-axis I can be negative then it'sgoing to go back up and be 0 negative 4and then it wants to be negative againtwix negative 4 and negative 2 so thegraph must come down and be negative fora while and go back up to being 0 atnegative 2 now the graph wants to bepositive tricks negative 2 and 4 so thegraph must do something of the followingilk and then go back down to being 04but it was to be positive at this nextrange positive between four and eight sothe gas graph must bounce up be positivefor a while and then be going back downto zero at eight and then want to bepositive again so I can see that thisgraph must be doing something of thisilk now this is a very crude sketch tobe honest I 'm going to be very strangebut most teachers now tell me off theysay this is valid between four and eighthas to be positive but we do n't reallyknow what the graph is doing betweenfour and eight it 's just being positiveso if I felt like it I have every rightin my mind to draw the graph asfollowers between four and eight dobecause I have no idea whoops one of thedisappeared I have no idea what'sactually going on there so maybe thegraph does something like that thatwould be a valid interpretation as crewssketch this polynomialthat 's fine in fact if you studycalculus you will learn that the graphbetween four and eight has to be just asingle bump but we do n't know that atthis stage so if iOS asked to sketchthis graph I would say that 's a finefeature there it is that 's a validsketch for that particular polynomiallet 's try another one let 's do a muchsimpler one that 's not be as crazy thistime let 's erase all this and we 'll askourself Graphing Factored Polynomials PART I (TANTON Mathematics) Graphing Factored Polynomials PART I (TANTON
