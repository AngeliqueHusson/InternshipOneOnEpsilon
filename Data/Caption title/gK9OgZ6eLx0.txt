understanding surface area cylinder derived interesting look cylinder two blue circular end one top one bottom analyze figure know area circle easily find surface area top bottom circular end important question find surface area curved surface let zoom bit first let separate circular top one bottom understand curved surface cut open vertically make look like cut surface vertically look like rectangle question need ask first length rectangle second breadth look carefully notice length rectangle actually circumference circular base pull open breadth breadth height cylinder let assume height cylinder h radius circular base r breadth h length pi r dont forget area rectangle curved surface area need find total surface area cylinder surface area sum two circle curved surface rectangle area circular base pi r squared since two equal circle write pi r squared plus pi r squared cover surface area bottom surface rectangle breath pir h pi r h actually curved surface area cylinder like term pi r squared write pi r h pi r common term write final formula pi r h given radius base height cylinder formula total surface area surface area cylinder surface area cylinder surface area cylinder surface area cylinder surface area cylinder surface area cylinder
