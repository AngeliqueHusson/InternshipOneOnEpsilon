following used describe geometric shape first name question quadrilateral quadrilateral literally closed shape four definitely closed shape four sides definitely quadrilateral next think whether parallelogram parallelogram quadrilateral two pair parallel sides pair theyre opposite case look side form angle line side also form angle line two sides parallel could make exact argument two sides line form angle side side form angle line right form angle line theyre parallel side parallel side right definitely also parallelogram next ask trapezoid trapezoid interesting sometimes trapezoid defined quadrilateral least one pair parallel sides sometimes defined one pair parallel sides let write trapezoid theres debate completely settled people say least one pair parallel sides thats one definition one possible definition one exactly one pair parallel answer question depend definition trapezoid one people refer actually one right exactly one pair parallel sides think trapezoid think something like side parallel side two parallel sometimes also see least one pair parallel would include parallelogram sit would inclusive parallelogram two pair parallel sides going go definition right exactly one pair parallel sides two pair parallel sides call trapezoid always important clarify people talking people might saya trapezoid least one pair parallel used definition would call trapezoid really depend definition let go rhombus rhombus quadrilateral four congruent rhombus look like four sides length theyre necessarily right angle figure two size length theres information tell side equal side side equal cant make claim necessarily rhombus dont know sure someone told us length equal length thing change sake one going go rhombus rectangle essentially parallelogram four right angle sand already established parallelogram also four right angle one two three four rectangle another way think rectangle opposite sides length four right definitely rectangle square couple way think square could view square rhombus four right straighten little bit rhombus four sides four right one way think square could view rectangle four sides congruent either case four sides congruent order square already established rule rhombus four sides necessarily congruent two pair congruent sides dont know whether side side congruent call square square rhombus trapezoid definition picked less inclusive version say exactly one pair parallel quadrilateral parallelogram rectangle quadrilateral perimeter area volume geometry khan academy quadrilateral perimeter area volume geometry khan academy quadrilateral perimeter area volume geometry khan academy quadrilateral perimeter area volume geometry khan academy quadrilateral perimeter area volume geometry khan academy
