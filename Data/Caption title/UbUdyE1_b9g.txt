We 're asked to subtract and simplify the answer , and wehave 8/18 minus 5/18.So subtracting fractions is verysimilar to adding fractions.If we have the same denominator , the denominatorin the difference is going to be the same as thedenominators in the two numbers that we'resubtracting , so it's going to be 18.And our numerator is going to be the difference between thenumerators.So in this case , it is 8 minus 5 , and this will be equal to 3over 18 , which is the answer , but it 's not completelysimplified , because both 3 and 18 are divisible by 3.So let 's divide them both by 3.So you divide 3 by 3 , you divide 18 by 3 , and you get 3divided by 3 is 1.18 divided by 3 is 6 , so you get 1/6.And just to see this visually , let me draw 18 parts.Let me draw 18 parts here.So it might be a little bit of a messy drawing.I 'll try the best I can.So let me draw six in this direction.So that is three right there.We have another three , so that 's six parts.And then let me split this into three columns.So there we go.We have 18 parts.Now 8/18 is equal to one , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight.That 's 8/18.And now we want to subtract five of the eighteenths , so wesubtract one , two , three , four , five.Now , what do we have left over ? Well , we have three of the eighteenths left over , so youhave that right there.You have three of the eighteenths left over.Now , if you turn three of the eighteenths into one piece , how many of those bigger pieces do you have ? This is one of those big pieces.Now , where are the other ones ? Well , this is another big piece right here.This is another big piece right here , another one , another one , and another one.If you had 18 pieces and you merged three of the piecesinto one , then you actually end up with only six pieces.You end up with six pieces.Hopefully , you see that each row is one of the pieces now , and the blue is exactly one of the six , so 3/18is the same as 1/6 . test
