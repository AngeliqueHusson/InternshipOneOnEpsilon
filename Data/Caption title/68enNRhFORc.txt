all right in this video I want to talkabout determining whether a trigfunction is odd even or neither norcrawl we say it functions even if it'ssymmetric about the y-axis and itsatisfies this equation f of negative xequals f of X if it 's odd we say it 's asymmetric about the origin or if it'ssymmetric about the origin we say it'sodd and that says F of negative x isgonna equal negative f of X well justfor a second let 's talk about you knowsine cosine tangent cotangent secant andcosecant let 's first off think about thegraph of sine and cosinewell I 've graphed a little bit here ofcosine but you know cosine is symmetricabout the y-axis which means it 's evenwhich means in terms of this definitionof what we can say is we can say cosineof negative x is gon na equal cosine of Xthat 's all we 're just using thisequation with cosine so we 'll get paidthis little equation cosine of negativex equals cosine of Xall right you know if you think aboutsine X well sine X is definitely oddit 's symmetric about the origin so againin terms of this definition it would saysine of negative x equals negative sineof X and again that 's what we get we saysine of negative x equals negative sineof X so again this is just using a youknow that kind of generic even oddrequirement with these specificfunctions sine and cosine well hey wecan figure out the others just by usingthese nowso suppose let 's do tangent first solet 's let our function be tangent X thetangent is just sine x over cosine X sonow let 's just use that even oddequation so we 'll plug in negative xthat will give us tangentnegative X but that 's going to be thesame thing as sine of negative x overcosine of negative x well we know sineof negative x is just going to benegative sine X cosine of negative X wesaid is just cosine X well that 's goingto give us just negative tangent X andthat says in fact hey we got negativethe thing we started so that says thattangent is simply going to be an oddfunction and again that makes sense ifyou think about the graph of tangent ofX the graph of tangent of X I 'm justgonna graph one little period of itbetween negative PI over two andpositive PI over two that definitelylooks like an odd functionokay so gon na be true thereyou know the same way if you usecotangent well cotangent of X is justgoing to be cosine X over sine X so thesame way F of negative x we getcotangent of negative X which would becosine of negative x over sine ofnegative x well we already said cosineof negative X is just cosine X and we'llget negative sine X cosine over sine iscotangent so we 'll get negativecotangent X and again that 's thenegative of the function we started withor the negative of our original functioncotangent X so that simply says thatagain cotangent of X is going to be anodd function same way we can do the sameway we can do just secant cosecant andyou know it 's pretty easy to see it'sgonna be you know they 'll be have theexact same type of symmetry that sineand cosine have so secant of X that 's 1over cosine X so if we call this againour function f of X well F of negative xwould be 1 over cosine of negative x butwe already said again that 's gon na giveus just 1 over cosine X which is againjust secant X which is our originalfunction f of X so it says secant of Xis gon na be an even function and lastbut not least we can do cosecant X sothat 's just 1 over sine X so f ofnegative X that would be well cosecantof negative x which is going to be 1over sine of negative x we said sine ofnegative x is just a negative sine X sowe 'll get 1 over negative sine X whichis going to be negative cosecant soagain that 's the negative of theoriginal function f of X so again whatthat tells us is now that this functionis simply odd so not the most thrillingcalculation but again if you can justremember this definition of even and oddyou know this very original where 'd itgo now this very original definition ofeven and odd as long as you remember thegraphs of sine and cosine the moral ofthe story is you can you know if youdo n't remember even the graph say of theother functions you can always sort of ayou know derive this stuff ratherquickly Examples with Trigonometric Functions: Even, Odd or Neither, Example 1 Examples with Trigonometric Functions: Even, Odd or Neither, Example 1 Examples with Trigonometric Functions: Even, Odd or Neither, Example 1
