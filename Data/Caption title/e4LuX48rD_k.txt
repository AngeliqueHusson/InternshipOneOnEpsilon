How to prove Pythagoras ' Theoremin under one minute.So Pythagoras ' Theorem is the famous theoremthat you all learnt in schoolwhich states that for any right-angle trianglethe square of the hypotenuseis equal to the sum of the squareson the other two sides.Or to put it another way , if I label these sides of this triangle a , b and c , then a squared plus b squared equals c squared . [ a^2+b^2=c^2 ] Now , if I want to prove this , all I have to dois to make four copies of the triangle , and arrange them inside this green square.And if I do that , I will create a squarein the center which has sides of length c.And so , this shaded squarein the center will have an areaof c squared . [ c^2 ] Now , I 'm going to rearrange the triangles , like this , and I will createtwo more shaded squareswhich will have areasof a squared up here , [ a^2 ] and b squared here . [ b^2 ] Now , since these all fit inside the same green square , I 've shown that the shaded regionshave the same area.In other words , a squared plus b squared equals c squared . [ a^2+b^2=c^2 ] test
