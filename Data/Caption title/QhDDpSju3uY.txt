Hi , this is Presh Talwalkar . In this video we 're going to talk about extending thefactorial function beyond the whole numbers and described the gamma function.For a brief refresher , the factorial function is a way to count the number ofarrangement of objects in a line.It 's often written with an exclamation point ( ! ) .So 1 factorial is 1 ; 2 factorial is 2 times 1 , which is 2 ; 3 factorial is 3 ... times 2 times 1 , which is 6 ; 4 factorial is 4 times 3 times 2 times 1 , which is equal to 24 and in general n factorial is equal to the product of all the wholenumbers up to n. So let 's play around with the calculator and verify some ofthese calculations . We 'll start out by trying one factorial ; we 'll press one andthen the factorial to get an answer 1 . We 'll then do 2 factorial ; 2 factorial , that 's equal to 2 . Three factorial is equal to 6 , and 4 factorial is equal to 24.So everything is as we expected but let 's say we put in a fraction like .5.We actually get a result ! This is n't an error : you actually get a number , and that 's pretty interesting , and let 's try and figure out what this number is . Let 's say we square the number , and just because I know what the value is what i 'm going to multiply it by 4 , and we end up with 3.14159 ! This is something we recognize ; this is equal to pi ! So , quite remarkably we found out that one-half factorial is equal to thesquare root of pi divided by two ! So where does this come from because it has nothing to dowith the definition that we have just explained which we were all taught in school.So to explain how one half factorial is equal to that value will start out bygraphing the factorial function.So 1 factorial is 1 , 2 factorial is 2 , 3 factorial is 6 , and 4 factorial is 24.So these are the integer whole values of the factorial function and if we want toextend it beyond the whole numbers we can imagine connecting the dots.So one way we could extend the factorial function we just draw a line between anytwo dots , and that could define values for the factorial function for the decimals.We could try at smoothing out the curve ; there actually infinitely many ways wecan smooth out the curve . So we want to figure out a way that we can smooth outthe curve which has desirable properties . So we want to come up with the factorialfunction and we want the factorial of 1 -- we want this to be equal to 1 , so it matches with the fact that one factorial is 1.We also want f ( x + 1 ) equal x*f ( x ) . This allows us to say thefactorial thing that each new number is the product of the ones before it.The final properties we want to graph to be smooth and one way we can do that as wecould say that the log of f ( x ) needs to be convex.So that 's a function - I wo n't get into the details , but the reason we have thisis if you have these conditions there 's actually a unique solution there 's one function : the gamma function , that satisfies these three conditions.So that 's how we can extend the factorial function and it 's a complicated function.The gamma of x is equal to the integral from 0 to infinity of t to the power of x - 1times e to the power of -t , dt.So this will converge for some values of x ; it wo n't converge for other values ; but what we will do then , is we 'll define that x factorial is equal to gamma of x + 1.So this gamma function satisfies all three of the properties to the left , so since x factorial is defined this way we can then evaluate the gamma functionto find out that one-half factorial is equal to square root of pi over 2.So why do we care about the gamma function ? Well , this type of integral actually comes upin many applications like quantum physics , fluid dynamics , statistics , and even number theory.So there 's a really important reason that we want to extend the factorial function , and our calculators can actually evaluate it.I hope you liked this video .
