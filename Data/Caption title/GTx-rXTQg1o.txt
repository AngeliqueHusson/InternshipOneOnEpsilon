okay in this video I want to talk aboutthe rational roots test and the rationalroots test is when you have a polynomialso X raised to some positive wholenumber whatever coefficient same thingand the X is decrease in degree down tosome constant it says if there arerational rootsokay so polynomials can have roots thatare n't rational but it says if there arerational roots it says to get them youbasically look at factors of theconstant you look at factors of theleading coefficient you look at allpossibilities and then plus or plus orminus that so I think it 's bestillustrated with an example so what arethe so the question is what are thepossible rational roots of thispolynomial 2x to the third minus 3xsquared minus 11x plus 6 so againbasically it says what you do is youlook at the factors of the constant asub 0 and then we look at factors of theleading coefficient so that 's our a subn you do n't have to label them this waybut just to kind of correspond to what Ihad a second ago if you think aboutfactors of 6 well factors of 6 we have 12 3 & 6 and then our factors of 2 wellthat 's pretty easy our factors of 2 arejust 1 & 2 and now what we do it saysthe possible rational rootsand remember a rational number is just anumber that can be written as a decimalwho 's who 's who 's either the decimalterminates where the decimal has arepeating pattern to it that 's arational numberit says the possible rational rootsbasically it says you take all possiblecombinations of the numbers here on thetop divided by numbers on the bottom soI 'm going to write them all out and thenjust get rid of duplicates so it saysyou would get positive negative one overone positive negative one over two wouldbe a candidate positive negative twoover one positive negative two over twopositive negative three over onepositive negative three over twopositive negative six over one positivenegative six over two okay these are allthe possible rational roots for thispolynomial and again remember a root isjust a number that if we plug it in forX we 'll get zero out at the end so let'ssee what we have we have 1 over 1 whichis 1 1 over 2 which is 1/2 2 over 1 is 22 over 2 is 1 so we already have that 3over 1 is 3 we have 3 halves we have 6and again 6 over 2 is 3 so we alreadyhave that one listed as well excuse meso these are our possible rational rootsand let 's just check and see maybe wecan figure out what the roots of thispolynomial are so the question could beis x equals 1 a rootso let 's see if x equals 1 is a root sothat means if we plug one in we 'll get 2times 1 cubed minus 3 times 1 squaredminus 11 times 1 plus 6 and the questionis does this equal 0 that 's what itmeans to be a root so all we have to dois just simplify this down well 1 cubedis 1 times 2 is 2 1 squared is 1 times 3is 3 minus 11 plus 6 does that equal 0looks like we get negative 5 minus 11which is negative 16 plus 6 is negative10 well that certainly does n't equal 0which means no x equals 1 is not a rootokay so let 's check let 's check one moreand then I 'll tell you the solutions andyou can you can check them out herebecause I wo n't have time to check themall it will get kind of tedious so maybewe can check is x equals how aboutpositive 3 a rootwell let 's check and see so if we plug 3n it says F of 3 is 2 times 3 cubedminus 3 times 3 squared minus 11 times 3plus 6 3 cubed is 27 27 times 2 is 54 3squared is 9 9 times 3 is 27 minus 33plus 6 okay 54 minus 27 that 's negative27 minus 33 plus 6 well negative 27minus 33 is negative 6 negative 6 plus 6is 0 so yes 3 is a root in this case andyou can actually check I think myarithmetic was okay here x equals 1/2and x equals negative 2 are also rootsokay so in this case my polynomial I setit up to actually have three rationalroots but again that does n't have tohappen at all well one last question ifwe know the roots how does thispolynomial factor well if we know theroots we can factor it as wellyou just take the opposite signbasically so X minus 1/2 is a factor Xplus 2 is a factor and then X minus 3would also be a factor so you canmultiply this thing all out you canmultiply this thing all the way back outand check and see that you actually getthe very original thing back all rightso I hope this video helps if you haveany questions feel free to post themhopefully me or somebody else can canhelp you out test
