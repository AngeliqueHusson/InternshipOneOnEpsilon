video want talk rational root test test polynomial x raised positive whole number whatever coefficient thing x decrease degree constant say rational polynomial root arent rational say rational root say get basically look factor constant look factor leading coefficient look plus plus minus think example question possible rational root polynomial third minus minus plus basically say look factor constant sub look factor leading coefficient thats sub n dont label way kind correspond second ago think well factor factor well thats pretty easy factor possible rational root sand remember rational number written either decimal pattern thats number say possible rational say take top divided bottom going write get rid duplicate would get positive negative one one positive negative one two would candidate positive negative two one positive negative two two positive negative three one positive negative three two positive negative six one positive negative six two possible rational root polynomial remember root number plug x well get zero end already halves already one listed well excuse meso possible rational root sand let check see maybe figure root polynomial question could x equal root let see x equal root mean plug one well get cube minus times squared minus times plus question equal thats root simplify well cube dis times squared times minus plus equal like get negative minus negative plus well certainly doesnt equal mean x equal let check let check one ill tell solution check wont time check get kind tedious maybe check x equal positive root well let check see plug say f times times squared minus times cube times times minus minus thats minus plus well negative negative negative plus yes root case actually check think arithmetic x equal x equal negative also case polynomial actually three doesnt happen well one last question know root polynomial factor well know factor well take opposite sign basically x minus factor x plus factor x minus also factor multiply thing multiply thing way back check see actually get original thing back right hope video help question feel free post hopefully somebody else help rational root test theorem rational root test theorem rational root test theorem rational root test theorem rational root test theorem rational root test theorem rational root test theorem rational root test theorem rational root test theorem
