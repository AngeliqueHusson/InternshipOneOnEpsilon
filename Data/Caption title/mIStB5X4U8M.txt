video want talk little bit mean prime number see video hopefully see video pretty straightforward concept progress mathematical see theres actually fairly sophisticated built top idea prime number include idea cryptography maybe encryption computer could based prime dont know encryption dont worry right need know prime pretty important ill give definition definition might little see example sit hopefully pretty number prime natural number natural number example like essentially starting could say positive integer sit natural number divisible exactly two two natural shouldnt say two say two natural two natural exactly two natural one one two divisible thats didnt want say exactly two natural one number sis doesnt make sense example let figure prime let start natural number number might say look divisible divisible might say hey prime number remember part definition needs divisible exactly two natural divisible one natural number although might little counter intuitive move divisible natural seem meet constraint divisible exactly two natural thats right prime ill circle prime number sill circle well actually let different color since already used color ill circle circle prime interesting even number prime think even number also going divisible beyond wont prime well think future try definitely divisible really divisible anything divisible also prime try switch another color try definitely divisible also divisible times also divisible divisible three natural meet constraint try definitely divisible divisible divisible exactly divisible could divide would get remainder exactly divisible obviously divisible exactly two natural keep going theres kind pattern maybe ill try really hard one tend trip people let try divisible divisible divisible divisible four natural number factor si guess could say way exactly two divisible four move divisible also divisible prime think get general idea many natural learned two year old negative number snot fraction irrational decimal sand rest regular counting positive two divisible one prime way think dont think special case kind building block cant break almost like atom think atom people first thought kind thing know could divide atom sand actually might create nuclear explosion idea behind prime number sin theory prime theory know cant break product smaller natural like could say hey times break notice break product prime kind broken cant break say equal times case really havent broken much actually break actually break times way let think think whether prime let try clearly number divisible number natural number put going divisible always going start find anything else goes know prime could times could times got ton factor beyond prime definitely go doesnt go doesnt none goes prime ill give hard one one trick lot people prime interested maybe could pause video figure prime number find anything divisible seem like wow kind strange number might temp ted think prime going give answer prime also divisible times hopefully give good idea prime hopefully give future video maybe exercise prime factor multiple prealgebra khan academy prime factor multiple prealgebra khan academy prime factor multiple prealgebra khan academy prime factor multiple prealgebra khan academy prime factor multiple prealgebra khan academy prime factor multiple prealgebra khan academy prime factor multiple prealgebra khan academy prime factor multiple prealgebra khan academy
