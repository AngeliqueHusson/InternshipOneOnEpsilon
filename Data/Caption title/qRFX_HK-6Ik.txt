all right in this video we 're going totalk about absolute value and do some afew basic examples and absolute value issometimes described as being thedistance of a number from zero on thenumber line I do n't know I never reallythought about that the way I alwaysthought of it is I almost thought aboutthe bars as being like parentheses soyou 're gon na have to simplify everythinginside at first obviously we 're doing asimple example here basically it saysthe resulting number if the number onthe inside is positive well then itstays positive if it 's negative likenegative five you just again make itpositive and that 's somehow whatabsolute value does it just makes thingspositive so let 's do a couple exampleshere suppose I have two minus eight andabsolute value again you ca n't justbreak up the absolute value and somehowmake this positive two plus positiveeight that 's not the idea again thinkabout this stuff is like it'sparentheses so you want to simplifyinside first so two minus eight that'snegative sixokay I 've now got a single thing theabsolute value of negative six is justplain old positive six and that 's youranswersuppose I have the absolute value ofnegative two minus the absolute value oftenall right well the absolute value ofnegative two just turns into positivetwothe minus sign stays the minus sign it'snot inside the absolute value bars andthen the absolute value of ten is tenand two minus 10 equals negative eightand that 's your solution let 's do a fewmore examples here absolute valuesuppose I have five times the absolutevalue of negative three plus negativeabsolute value of negative eight squaredall right well in this case again we'regoing to do just the same thing we'llsimplify down our absolute value so theabsolute value of negative threethat 's going to turn into just positivethree plus the absolute value ofnegative eight is just positive eightand we still have to square that fivetimes three is fifteen eight times eightis sixty-four if we add these we'regoing to get seventy nine and that 's oursolution maybe one more absolute valueproblem here suppose I have three timesfour minuseight the absolute value of that minustwo times one plus four absolute valueof that again all squaredwell again I 'm going to simplifyeverything down inside the absolutevalue to begin with and then just gofrom there so four minus eight isnegative four again even though it 's anegative four I 'm going to just keepworking on the inside minus two timesone plus four is just five squared sothree times negative 4 that 's negative12 two times five is ten squared theabsolute value of negative 12 is justplain ol positive twelve the minus signagain is not in the inside the absolutevalue so we 'll leave that alone and theabsolute value of 10 is just 10 I stillhave to square that though so 10 times10 is 100 and now at this case I get 12minus 100 what is that I think about itas being 100 minus 12 which is 88 butsince it 's 12 minus 100 I 'll getnegative 88 as my solution and that'sall there is to absolute value so againthe basic idea just simplify everythingdown inside the absolute value barsbefore you start trying to get rid ofyour positives and your negatives andall of that stuff so I hope theseexamples make some sense definitely feelfree to take a look at my website justmath tutoring com should be a link onthe right side of this video that'lltake you therethere 's a whole bunch of other videosthat are nice and organized should beeasy to find some other some othertopics if you 've got other questionsthis helps test
