Let 's start off with segment AB.So that 's point A . This is point B right over here.And let 's set up a perpendicular bisector of this segment.So it will be both perpendicular and it will split the segmentin two.So thus we could call that line l.That 's going to be a perpendicular bisector , so it 's going to intersect at a 90-degree angle , and it bisects it.This length and this length are equal , and let 's call this point right over hereM , maybe M for midpoint.What I want to prove first in this videois that if we pick an arbitrary point on this line thatis a perpendicular bisector of AB , then that arbitrary pointwill be an equal distant from A , or that distancefrom that point to A will be the sameas that distance from that point to B.So let me pick an arbitrary point on this perpendicularbisector.So let 's call that arbitrary point C.And so you can imagine we like to draw a triangle , so let 's draw a triangle where we draw a line from C to Aand then another one from C to B.And essentially , if we can prove that CA is equal to CB , then we 've proven what we want to prove , that C is an equal distance from A as it is from B. Well , there 's a couple of interesting things we see here.We know that AM is equal to MB , and we alsoknow that CM is equal to itself.Obviously , any segment is going to be equal to itself.And we know if this is a right angle , this is also a right angle.This line is a perpendicular bisector of AB.And so we have two right triangles.And actually , we don't even have to worry aboutthat they 're right triangles.If you look at triangle AMC , you have this sideis congruent to the corresponding side on triangleBMC.Then you have an angle in between that correspondsto this angle over here , angle AMC corresponds to angle BMC , and they 're both 90 degrees , so they 're congruent.And then you have the side MC that 's on both triangles , and those are congruent.So we can just use SAS , side-angle-side congruency.So we can write that triangle AMCis congruent to triangle BMC by side-angle-side congruency.And so if they are congruent , thenall of their corresponding sides are congruentand AC corresponds to BC.So these two things must be congruent.This length must be the same as this length right over there , and so we 've proven what we want to prove.This arbitrary point C that sits on the perpendicularbisector of AB is equidistant from both A and B.And I could have known that if I drew my C over here or here , I would have made the exact same argument , so any C thatsits on this line.So that 's fair enough.So let me just write it.So this means that AC is equal to BC.Now , let 's go the other way around.Let 's say that we find some point thatis equidistant from A and B . Let'sprove that it has to sit on the perpendicular bisector.So let 's do this again.So I 'll draw it like this.So this is my A . This is my B , and let 's throw out some point.We 'll call it C again.So let 's say that C right over here , and maybe I 'll draw a C right down here.So this is C , and we 're going to start with the assumptionthat C is equidistant from A and B.So CA is going to be equal to CB.This is what we're going to start off with.This is going to be our assumption , and what we want to prove is that Csits on the perpendicular bisector of AB.So we 've drawn a triangle here , and we 've done this before.We can always drop an altitude from this sideof the triangle right over here.So we can set up a line right over here.Let me draw it like this.So let 's just drop an altitude right over here.Although we 're really not dropping it.We 're kind of lifting an altitude in this case.But if you rotated this around sothat the triangle looked like this , so this was B , this is A , and that C was up here , you would reallybe dropping this altitude.And so you can construct this lineso it is at a right angle with AB , and let me call this the point at which it intersects M. Soto prove that C lies on the perpendicular bisector , we really have to show that CM isa segment on the perpendicular bisector , and the way we've constructed it , it is already perpendicular.We really just have to show that it bisects AB.So what we have right over here , we have two right angles.If this is a right angle here , this one clearlyhas to be the way we constructed it.It 's at a right angle.And then we know that the CM is going to be equal to itself.And so this is a right angle.We have a leg , and we have a hypotenuse.We know by the RSH postulate , we have a right angle.We have one corresponding leg that'scongruent to the other corresponding legon the other triangle.We have a hypotenuse that 's congruentto the other hypotenuse , so that meansthat our two triangles are congruent.So triangle ACM is congruent to triangle BCM by the RSHpostulate.Well , if they 're congruent , then their corresponding sidesare going to be congruent.So that tells us that AM must be equal to BM because they'retheir corresponding sides.So this side right over here is goingto be congruent to that side.So this really is bisecting AB.So this line MC really is on the perpendicular bisector.And the whole reason why we 're doing this is now wecan do some interesting things with perpendicular bisectorsand points that are equidistant from pointsand do them with triangles.So just to review , we found , hey if any pointsits on a perpendicular bisector of a segment , it 's equidistant from the endpoints of a segment , and we went the other way.If any point is equidistant from the endpoints of a segment , it sits on the perpendicular bisector of that segment.So let 's apply those ideas to a triangle now.So let me draw myself an arbitrary triangle.I 'll try to draw it fairly large.So let 's say that 's a triangle of some kind.Let me give ourselves some labels to this triangle.That 's point A , point B , and point C.You could call this triangle ABC.Now , let me just construct the perpendicular bisectorof segment AB.So it 's going to bisect it.So this distance is going to be equal to this distance , and it 's going to be perpendicular.So it looks something like that.And it will be perpendicular.Actually , let me draw this a little differentbecause of the way I've drawn this triangle , it 's making us get close to a special case , whichwe will actually talk about in the next video.Let me draw this triangle a little bit differently.OK.This one might be a little bit better.And we 'll see what special case I was referring to.So this is going to be A . This isgoing to be B . This is going to be C.Now , let me take this point rightover here , which is the midpoint of A and Band draw the perpendicular bisector.So the perpendicular bisector might look something like that.And I do n't want it to make it necessarily intersect in Cbecause that 's not necessarily going to be the case.But this is going to be a 90-degree angle , and this length is equal to that length.And let me do the same thing for segment AC right over here.Let me take its midpoint , which if I just roughly draw it , it looks like it's right over there.And then let me draw its perpendicular bisector , so it would look something like this.So this length right over here is equal to that length , and we see that they intersect at some point.Just for fun , let's call that point O.And now there 's some interesting properties of point O.We know that since O sits on AB 's perpendicular bisector , we know that the distance from O to Bis going to be the same as the distance from Oto A . That 's what we proved in this first little proofover here.So we know that OA is going to be equal to OB.Well , that 's kind of neat.But we also know that because of the intersectionof this green perpendicular bisectorand this yellow perpendicular bisector , we also know because it sits on the perpendicularbisector of AC that it 's equidistant from Aas it is to C. So we know that OA is equal to OC.Now , this is interesting.OA is equal to OB.OA is also equal to OC , so OC and OBhave to be the same thing as well.So we also know that OC must be equal to OB.OC must be equal to OB.Well , if a point is equidistant from two other points thatsit on either end of a segment , then that pointmust sit on the perpendicular bisector of that segment.That 's that second proof that we did right over here.So it must sit on the perpendicular bisector of BC.So if I draw the perpendicular bisector right over there , then this definitely lies on BC 's perpendicular bisector.And what 's neat about this simple little proofthat we 've set up in this video iswe 've shown that there 's a unique point in this trianglethat is equidistant from all of the vertices of the triangleand it sits on the perpendicular bisectors of the three sides.Or another way to think of it , we'veshown that the perpendicular bisectors , or the three sides , intersect at a unique point that isequidistant from the vertices.And this unique point on a triangle has a special name.We call O a circumcenter.And because O is equidistant to the vertices , so this distance -- let me do this in a colorI have n't used before.This distance right over here is equal to that distance rightover there is equal to that distance over there.If we construct a circle that has a center at Oand whose radius is this orange distance , whose radius is any of these distances over here , we 'll have a circle that goes through allof the vertices of our triangle centered at O.So our circle would look somethinglike this , my best attempt to draw it.And so what we 've constructed right here is one , we 've shown that we can construct something like this , but we call this thing a circumcircle , and this distance right here , we call it the circumradius.And once again , we know we can construct itbecause there 's a point here , and it is centered at O.Now this circle , because it goes through allof the vertices of our triangle , wesay that it is circumscribed about the triangle.So we can say right over here that the circumcircle O , so circle O right over here is circumscribedabout triangle ABC , which just means that all threevertices lie on this circle and that every point isthe circumradius away from this circumcenter .
