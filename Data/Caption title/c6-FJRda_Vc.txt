y is directly proportional to x.If y equals 30 when x is equal to 6 , find the value of x when y is 45.So let 's just take this each statement at a time.y is directly proportional to x.That 's literally just saying that yis equal to some constant times x.This statement can literally be translatedto y is equal to some constant times x.y is directly proportional to x.Now , they tell us , if y is 30 when x is 6 -- and we have this constant of proportionality -- this second statement right over hereallows us to solve for this constant.When x is 6 , they tell us y is 30so we can figure out what this constant is.We can divide both sides by 6 and weget this left-hand side is 5 -- 30 divided by 6 is 5.5 is equal to k or k is equal to 5.So the second sentence tells us , this gives us the informationthat y is not just k times x , it tells usthat y is equal to 5 times x. y is 30 when x is 6.And then finally , they say , find the value of x when y is 45.So when y is 45 is equal to -- so we 're justputting in 45 for y -- 45 is equal to 5x.Divide both sides by 5 to solve for x.We get 45 over 5 is 9 , and 5x divided by 5 is just x.So x is equal to 9 when y is 45 .
