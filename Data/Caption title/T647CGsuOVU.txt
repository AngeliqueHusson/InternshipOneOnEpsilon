Imaginary Numbers Are Real [ Part 1 : Introduction ] Let 's say we 're given the function f ( x ) = x^2 + 1.We can graph our function and get a nice parabola.Now let 's say we want to figure out where the equation equals zerowe want to find the roots.On our plot this should be where the function crosses the x-axis.As we can see , our parabola actually never crosses the x-axis , so according to our plot , there are no solutions to the equation x^2+1=0.But there 's a small problem.A little over 200 years ago a smart guy named Gaussproved that every polynomial equation of degree nhas exactly n roots.Our polynomial has a highest power , or degree , of two , so we should have two roots.And Gauss ' discovery is not just some random rule , today we call it the FUNDAMENTAL THEOREM OF ALGEBRA.So our plot seems to disagree with something so important it 's called the FUNDAMENTAL THEOREM OF ALGEBRA , which might be a problem.What Guass is telling us here , is that there are two perfectly good values of xthat we could plug into our function , and get zero out.Where could these 2 missing roots be ? The short answer here is that we do n't have enough numbers.We typically think of numbers existing on a 1 dimensional continuum - the number line.All our friends are here : 0 , 1 , negative numbers , fractions , even irrational numbers like root 2 show up.But this system is incomplete.And our missing numbers are not just further left or right , they live in a whole new dimension.Algebraically , this new dimensionhas everything to do with a problem that was mathematically considered impossible for over two thousand years : the square root of negative one.When we include this missing dimension in our analysis , our parabola gets way more interesting.Now that our input numbers are in their full two dimensional form , we see how our function x^2+1 really behaves.And we can now see that our function does have exactly two roots ! We were just looking in the wrong dimension.So , why is this extra dimension that numbers possess not common knowledge ? Part of this reason is that it has been given a terrible , terrible name.A name that suggest that these numbers are n't ever real ! In fact , Gauss himself had something to say about this naming convention . So yes , this missing dimension is comprised of numbers that have been given ridiculous name imaginary.Gauss proposed these numbers should instead be given the name lateralso from here on , let 's let lateral mean imaginary.To get a better handle on imaginary , I mean , lateral numbers , and really understand what 's going on here , let 's spend a little time thinking about numbers.Early humans really only had use for the natural numbers , that is 1 , 2 , 3 , and so on.This makes sense because of how numbers were used.So to early humans , the number line would have just been a series of dots.As civilizations advanced , people needed answers to more sophisticated math questions ¨Clike when to plant seeds , how to divide land , and how to keep track of financial transactions.The natural numbers just weren¡¯t cutting it anymore , so the Egyptians innovatedand developed a new , high tech solution : fractions.Fractions filled in the gaps in our number line , and were basically cutting edge technology for a couple thousand years.The next big innovations to hit the number line were the number zero and negative numbers , but it took some time to get everyone on board.Since it¡¯s not obvious what these numbers meanor how they fit into the real world , zero and negative numbers were met with skepticism , and largely avoided or ignored.Some cultures were more suspicious than others , depending largely on how people viewed the connection between mathematics and reality.And this is not all ancient history -just a few centuries ago , mathematicians would intentionally move terms around to avoid having negatives show up in equations.Suspicion of zero and negative numbers did eventually fade -partially because negatives are useful for expressing concepts like debt , but mostly because negatives just kept sneaking into mathematics.It turns out there¡¯s just a whole lot of math you just can¡¯t doif you don¡¯t allow negative numbers to play.Without negatives , simple algebra problems like x + 3 = 2 have no answer.Before negatives were accepted , this problem would have no solution , just like we thought our original problem had no solution.The thing is , it¡¯s not crazy or weird to think problems like this have no solutions ¨Cin words , this algebra problem basically says : ¡°if I have 2 things and I take away 3 , how many things do I have left ? ¡±It¡¯s not surprising that most of the people who have lived on our planet would be suspicious of questions like this.These problems don¡¯t make much sense.Even brilliant mathematicians of the 18th century , such as Leonard Euler , didn¡¯t really know what to do with negativeshe at one point wrote that negatives were greater than infinity.So it¡¯s fair to say thatnegative and imaginary numbers raise a lot of very good , very valid questions.Like why do we require students to understand and work with numbersthat eluded the greatest mathmatical minds for thousands of years ? Why did we even come accept negative and imaginary numbers in the first place , when they don¡¯t really seem connected to anything in the real world ? And how do these extra numbers help explain the missing solutions to our problem ? Next time , we¡¯ll begin to address these questionsby going way back to the discovery of imaginary numbers .
