This here is a screenshot of the Khan Academy unit circlemodule.And the whole point here is to getyou familiar with the unit circle definition of trigfunctions , which is just an extensionof the traditional SOHCAHTOA definition.But the reason why the math world did thisis so that we can define the sine and cosines of angles thatare 90 degrees or more , or that have actual negative anglemeasures.So let 's figure out what the sine of 275 degrees is.So we have this dot that's sitting on a unit circle thathas a circle of radius 1.And let 's hit this dot to 275 degrees.Let 's make an angle of 275 degreeswith the positive x-axis.So let 's see , that 's 50 degrees , 75 degrees , 90 degrees.You see the angle measure right over there.So 90 degrees , 180 gets us halfway around.270 gets us at 3/4 of the way around.So 275 is a little bit more than that.And we need to figure out the sine of 275 degrees.The unit circle definition of sineis that it 's the y value of that angle measure on the unitcircle.So we 've made the angle measure.We 've gone 275 degrees counterclockwisefrom the positive x-axis to get to this point right over here.And the y value is this negative 0.996.That is the sine of 275 degrees.Negative 0.996.If they 'd asked for the cosine , then wewould give the x value of this point of this dot rightover here.So the y value is negative 0.996.Let 's check our answer.Very good.Let 's do another one.And we get -- let 's see -- sine of negative 55 degrees.So now we 're going to go below the x-axis.It 's a negative angle.Negative 55 degrees.And it 's sine once again , so we wantto look at the y-coordinate of this point.So the y-coordinate is negative 0.819.Negative 0.819.Check our answer.Very good.Let 's keep doing it.Maybe we 'll see a cosine soon enough.Sine of 285 degrees.So 285 degrees , we're looking right over there.The sine is the y value.Negative 0.966.Let 's check our answer.Let 's do another one.Sine again.2/3 pi.So now it 's in radians.We do n't see that little degree sign.So 2/3 pi.Let 's see -- 2/3 pi is right over here.That 's the angle in radians relative to the positive x-axisgoing in the counterclockwise direction.We care about the sine which is the yvalue of our point sitting on the unit circle.0.866.And one thing that bears mention is the exactis square root of 3/2.And square root of 3/2 if you were to write it as a decimalwould just continue on forever without actually repeating.This is just an approximation.For the sake of this module , we reallyjust want to make you comfortable with the unitcircle , and maybe using this tool.So you really should just type in this approximate number.You do n't have to do the exact numberof what square root of 3/2 is.This is it rounded to the nearest thousand.So 0.866.Let 's check our answer.Let 's do another one.Sine again.Sine of 15 degrees.So 15 degrees.0.259.I 'm going to keep doing this until I get a cosine.So let 's do it again -- cosine ! Very good.2 pi.2 pi radians.Well 2 pi is completely going around the unit circle once.So let 's go all the way around , and wesee that we get back to where we were before.We 've gone around to 2 pi radians.We 're back to where we were before.The cosine is the x value of that point.So the x value of that point is 1.The x value of the point is 1.If we wanted the sine of 2 pi , then wewould get 0 because we have no y value right over here.We 're at the x-axis.Let 's check our answer.Let 's do one.Maybe we 'll see another cosine.There we go.Another cosine.Cosine of 112 pi.So that 's just going to be a little -- let'ssee , 1/35 , 1/18 , 1/12.Cosine.We want the x value , not the y value.The x value is 0.966.So 0.966.Check our answer.And we are done . test
