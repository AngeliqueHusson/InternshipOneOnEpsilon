remember that a planar graph is a graphthat can be drawn in the plane withoutany edges crossing over each other and aplane graph is an example of such adrawing in the plane where we do n't haveany edge crossings so here let 's draw anexample of a plane graph will also markoff the four regions that it creates andcall them r1 r2 r3 and r4 next we wantto take a look at how many verticesedges and regions it has we already sawthat it has four regions so in thisexample we have seven vertices and nineedges and four regions now you maynotice that if you take the number ofvertices minus the number of edges plusthe number of regions you get two okaywell let 's try another example thisgreen plane graph has seven verticeseight edges and three regions and againwe notice that the number of verticesminus the number of edges plus thenumber of regions equals two this is notjust a coincidence it actually holds forevery connected plane graph so thetheorem that we want to prove is that ifG is a connected plane graph with nvertices M edges and our regions then nminus M plus r is equal to 2 this isactually known as Euler 's formula forplane graphs Euler has a lot of formulasfor different areas of mathematics butremember that he actually created thearea of mathematics known as graphtheory we 've seen that this theoremworks for these two examples but now wewant to try to figure out how to proveit in general the proof will useinduction on M the number of edges thebase case is just when M equals 0 so youhave a connected plane graph on no edgesthat means the graph must be k1 just theisolated vertex so that means that n isequal to 1 we know M is 0 and our thenumber of regions is just 1 well clearly1 minus 0 plus 1 equals 2so the base case is done next we makethe inductive hypothesis suppose thatthe theorem is true for all connectedplane graphs with fewer than M edgeswhere m is something bigger than orequal to 1 next we need to use theinductive hypothesis to show that thetheorem will have to hold for anyconnected plane graph on M edges solet 's start by letting G be a connectedplane graph on M edges and let 's say ithas n vertices and our region 's ourproof now divides up into two casesdepending on whether or not our graph Gis a tree remember that a graph is atree if it is connected and a cyclicthat means that it 's connected and hasno cycle if you want a review aboutgraphs which are trees check the linksin the description below for videos allabout trees our first case to consideris the case if G is a treewell that will tell us that M is equalto n minus 1 and the proof of this canbe found in a previous video so checkthe links in the description below nowwe know the number of edges it has alsonotice that there will be exactly oneregion that 's because when you draw atree having no cycle means that noregion is closed off so the only regionis the exterior unbounded region so inthis case n minus M plus R is just equalto n minus n minus 1 plus 1 and we get 2so if G is a tree then we 're done weknow that it will work next we look atthe case where G is not a tree wealready know that G is a connected graphso if G is connected but not a tree thenG must by definition have a cycle C nowwe 'll let e be an edge on our cycle Cnow our aim is to remove that edge E andapply the inductive hypothesis to thesmaller graph G without E we need to becareful of one thing though if we removethe edge e we need to make sure that wedo n't disconnect the graph because theinductive hypothesis only works onconnected plane graphs so think about eif removing e will disconnect ourconnected graph then e would be what'scalled a bridge edge but we 've seen inthe video about bridge edges that anedge is a bridge if and only if it lieson no cycle however e clearly lies on acycle we took it to belong to the cycleC that tells us that E is not a bridgeedge and therefore the graph without theedge e is still connected of course it'sstill planar as well and it has nvertices M minus 1 edges and R minus 1regions to see why this is let 's take alook at a very small example here I'mdrawing a plane graph which has a fewcycles in it so we 're in this case andI 'll highlight a particular cycle andcall that C next I 'll highlight someedge of that cycle call that e and youcan clearly see that if you were toremove that edge you 're not going todisconnect the graph also of course thegraph stays planar now notice of courseyou 've removed an edge so the number ofedges goes down by 1 the number ofvertices stays but look at what happensto the number of regions removing edge emeans that in this example r2 and r3join into one region and in generalremoving an edge of a cycle in a planegraph will just decrease the number ofregions by 1 thus by the inductivehypothesis the theorem holds for thegraph G without e remember G without Eis connected and a plane graph and hasfewer than M edges so we know that it'snumber of vertices - its number of edgesplus it 's number of regions must equal -that 's again by the inductive hypothesisbut if you simplify that you 'll see thatn minus M plus R equals 2 and thereforeby the principle of mathematicalinduction thetheorem holds for all values of M biggerthan or equal to zerothus we know that a connected planegraph with n vertices M edges and ourregions will satisfy the equation nminus M plus R equals two and a proof isdone so we can put the square so torecap we know that a connected planegraph satisfies this equation well whatabout a disconnected plane graph thistheorem actually does generalize so itcomes out as a corollary if G is a planegraph with C of G connected componentsthen the number of vertices minus thenumber of edges plus the number ofregions just equals 1 plus the number ofconnected components let 's take a lookat a small example so here I 'll draw itnotice that it has 3 connectedcomponents and I 'll start to label theregions you 'll see that it has 5 regionsnow the number of vertices in this graphis 12 the number of edges is 13 thenumber regions is 5 of course the numberof connected components is 3 so if youput this all together you 'll see that nminus M plus r is equal to 4 which isclearly the same as 1 plus 3 so thetheorem does generalize to thedisconnected case as well Oilers formulais often talked about in the context ofpolyhedra here I 'll draw a polyhedronwhich happens to be a tetrahedron and ithas five vertices and it has eight edgesand five faces so we 'll write V E and Ffor the number of vertices edges andfaces we can also draw a graph whichlooks like a bird 's eye view of thistetrahedron and that 's the Associatedgraph to that polyhedron notice that ithas five vertices and eight edges andfive regions notice that in this picturethe bottom of the tetrahedroncorresponds to the region that is theexterior unbounded region in our planegraph so in general if V E and F are thenumber of vertices edges and faces in apolyhedron then V minus Eplus f is equal to two this is known asEuler 's polyhedron formula it 's actuallya pretty famous formula so now you knowwhere it comes fromclick here for related videos and staytuned for more new videos on graphtheory topics I 'll see you there Graph Theory: 58.
