the great thing about finding the areaof a trapezoid is that the formula isnot that hard to understand here 's whatit is the area of a trapezoid isone-half times our height times our baseone plus our base two it 's kind of likefinding the area of a triangle but wehave two bases there so we would see wehave a top base here and a bottom baseset whenever you see a trapezoid oranything one looks like that you justadd up your two bases and you multiplythat by the height and take the half ofit may sound confusing let 's put it intoplay and I 'll show you how easy it is tounderstand so we have area is equal to1/2 times our height which is 17 inchesI 'm just going to go ahead and put 17 inhere times our two bases added togetherso it 's 27 and we 'll call that base oneplus 33 that would be base 2 what wouldhappen if you called 33 your base oneand 27 your base - it does n't matterthey 're interchangeable as long as youput them together and add them you'reokay you have to add them first so nowthat equals 1/2 times 17 times 60 okaynow in order of operations what are theyalways tell you work from left to rightcorrect well you can do that and you cantake one half of 17 what I 'm going to dois I 'm going to multiply 17 times 60first whenever my steps are justmultiplication it 's okay I can go inthat order so now I 'm going to say thatit 's 1/2 times 1020 and then I take thehalf of that so the area of thistrapezoid would be 510 and now we'retalking about area right so we go aheadand putour units squared in this case it wouldbe interest so the area of thistrapezoid is 510 inches square it 's nottoo difficult and do n't worry we'regoing to go over some more problems soyou guys have a good understanding ofthis Algebra - Area of a Trapezoid Algebra - Area of a Trapezoid Algebra - Area of a Trapezoid
