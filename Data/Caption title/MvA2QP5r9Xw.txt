what is 0/0 this question is trendingright now because Apple engineersincluded an Easter Egg on the iPhone ifyou ask this question to Siri you willget the following response imagine thatyou have zero cookies and you split themevenly among zero friends how manycookies does each person get see itdoes n't make senseand Cookie Monster said that there areno cookies and you are sad that you haveno friendswhile Siri gives a sarcastic responsethe answer that 0/0 is indeterminate isconsidered an acceptable answer sowhat 's the problem with dividing by zeroone problem is if we could divide byzero we get contradictory results weknow that one times zero is equal to twotimes zero because any number times zerois equal to zero if we could divide byzero the way we normally divide by othernumbers or if zero had a multiplicativeinverse then we could divide thisequation by zero and cancel out thezeros to find that one equals two thiswould clearly ruin everything we knowabout mathematics and this would causealgebra to be meaningless we can in facthave this for any numbers a and B that atimes zero equals B times zero and whenwe divide by zero or multiply by themultiplicative inverse we get a equals Bso one reason we ca n't divide by zero isthat it would n't be a meaningfuloperation relative to the rest ofalgebra and mathematics that we built upbut Siri said that zero dividing by zerois indeterminate so what does that meanwell think about dividing one by smallerand smaller decimals if you takepositive decimals you will eventuallyget that one divided by these smallerand smaller positive decimals will beplus infinity graphically as we approachzero from positive numbers the graphkeeps on going up topositive infinity if you did theoperation from negative numbers as yougot smaller and smaller and closer tozero you 'd get one divided by thesenumbers is negative infinity and thegraph goes the other way so what happenswhen you divide exactly at zero well thelimit approaches both plus infinity andnegative infinity and therefore we saythe limit is indeterminate and that'sanother problem with dividing by zero soSiri does give the correct answeralthough it is accompanied by thesarcastic response I hope you like thisvideo please subscribe to my channel Imake videos on math and game theory youcan catch me on my blog mind yourdecisions which you can follow onFacebook Google+ and patreon you canalso catch me at pressure Locker onsocial media and please check out mybooks there 's a link in the videodescription thanks for watching What Is 0 Divided By 0?
