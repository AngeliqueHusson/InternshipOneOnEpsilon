We 're told that for the past few months , Old Maple Farmshas grown about 1,000 more apples than their chief rivalin the region , River Orchards.Due to cold weather this year , the harvests at both farmswere down by about a third.However , both farms made up for some of the shortfall bypurchasing equal quantities of apples from farms inneighboring states.What can you say about the number of applesavailable at each farm ? Does one farm have more than the other , or do they have thesame amount ? How do I know ? So let 's define some variables here.Let 's let M be equal to number of apples at Maple Farms . Andthen who 's the other guy ? River Orchards.So let 's let R be equal to the number ofapples at River Orchards.So this first sentence , they say -- let me do this in adifferent color -- they say for the past few years , Old MapleFarms has grown about 1,000 more apples than their chiefrival in the region , River Orchards.So we could say , hey , Maple is approximately Old River , or Mis approximately River plus 1,000.Or since we do n't know the exact amount -- it says it'sabout 1,000 more , so we don't know it 's exactly 1,000 more -- we can just say that in a normal year , Old Maple Farms , which we denote by M , has a larger amount of apples thanRiver Orchard.So in a normal year , M is greater than R , right ? It has about 1,000 more apples than Old Maple Farms.Now , they say due to cold weather this year -- so let'stalk about this year now -- the harvests at both farms weredown about a third.So this is n't a normal year.Let 's talk about what 's going to happen this year.In this year , each of these characters are going to bedown by 1/3.Now if I go down by 1/3 , that's the same thing as being2/3 of what I was before.Let me do an example.If I 'm at x , and I take away 1/3x , I 'm left with 2/3x.So going down by 1/3 is the same thing as multiplying thequantity by 2/3.So if we multiply each of these quantities by 2/3 , wecan still hold this inequality , because we'redoing the same thing to both sides of this inequality , andwe 're multiplying by a positive number.If we were multiplying by a negative number , we would haveto swap the inequality.So we can multiply both sides of this by 2/3.So 2/3 of M is still going to be greater than 2/3 of R.And you could even draw that in a number line if you like.Let 's do this in a number line.This all might be a little intuitive for you , and if itis , I apologize , but if it's not , it never hurts.So that 's 0 on our number line.So in a normal year , M is has 1,000 more than R.So in a normal year , M might be over here andmaybe R is over here.I do n't know , let 's say R is over there.Now , if we take 2/3 of M , that's going to stick us someplace around , oh , I do n't know , 2/3is right about there.So this is M -- let me write this -- this is 2/3 M.And what 's 2/3 of R going to be ? Well , if you take 2/3 of this , you get to right about there , that is 2/3R.So you can see , 2/3R is still less than 2/3M , or 2/3M isgreater than 2/3R.Now , they say both farms made up for some of the shortfallby purchasing equal quantities of apples from farms inneighboring states.So let 's let a be equal to the quantityof apples both purchased.So they 're telling us that they bothpurchased the same amount.So we could add a to both sides of this equation and itwill not change the inequality.As long as you add or subtract the same value to both sides , it will not change the inequality.So if you add a to both sides , you have a plus 2/3M is agreater than 2/3R plus a.This is the amount that Old Maple Farms has afterpurchasing the apples , and this is the amount that RiverOrchards has.So after everything is said and done , Old Maple Farmsstill has more apples , and you can see that here.Maple Farms , a normal year , this year they only had 2/3 ofthe production , but then they purchased a apples.So let 's say a is about , let's say that a is that manyapples , so they got back to their normal amount.So let 's say they got back to their normal amount.So that 's how many apples they purchased , sohe got back to M.Now , if R , if River Orchards also purchased a apples , thatsame distance , a , if you go along here gets you to rightabout over there.So once again , this is -- let me do it a little bitdifferent , because I do n't like it overlapping , so let medo it like this.So let 's say this guy , M -- I keep forgetting their names -- Old Maple Farms purchases a apples , gets them that far.So that 's a apples.But River Orchards also purchases a apples , so let'sadd that same amount.I 'm just going to copy and paste it so it 's the exactsame amount.So River Orchards also purchases a , so it alsopurchases that same amount.So when all is said and done , River Orchards is going tohave this many apples in the year that they had lessproduction but they went and purchased it.So this , right here , is -- this value right hereis 2/3R plus a.That 's what River Orchards has.And then Old Maple Farms has this value right here , whichis 2/3M plus a.Everything said and done , Old Maple Farmsstill has more apples . test
