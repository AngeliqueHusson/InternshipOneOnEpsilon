Hi , this is Presh Talwalkar.Let 's discuss an interesting infinite fraction.Let 's say you need to solve for xin the equation , x equals one plus one over one plus one over one plus ... et cetera , repeating infinitely.How would you solve for x ? If you want to take a stab at the problem , you can pause the video . Otherwise , keep watching for the solution.The trick is to observe a pattern.If you circle the terms under the denominator , one plus one over one plus ... et cetera , This exactly is equal to the variable x.This means we can replace everything under the denominator with the variable x.And thus , we have the equation `` x equals one plus one over x . `` If we multiply both sides by x , we get x squared equals x plus one.We can solve this with the quadratic formula.x equals ( One plus or minus the square root of five ) over two.Since x only had positive terms , we get rid of the negative solution.So x is equal to 1.618 , And this is the Golden Ratio.Please subscribe to my channel.You can support me on Patreon.Catch me on my blog , Mind Your Decisions , On twitter , at `` Presh Talwalkar , '' And get my E-Books at Amazon . test
