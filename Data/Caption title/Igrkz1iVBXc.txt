right video going example formula way find area triangle triangle linked side links b c first thing actually going going compute whats semiperimeter take plus b plus c divide get value underneath square root take quantity minus times minus b times minus c thats simply going give us area triangle let little simple example want know whats area triangle sides measuring six inch es nine inch es well first thing would would compute semiperimeter well take four plus six plus nine divide two well let plus plus would think going leave fraction time underneath square root would basically square root let see take subtract away value let well take subtract away value well take subtract away value c let thats going expression area taking semiperimeter semiperimeter side links little bit simplification alright hopefully nothing see weve got could always make guess let write one way got could make weve got could subtract away would let see weve got guess minus would let see minus would give us minus would give us point dont see much anything thats really going know sort simplify nicely know going cancel thats let see times times denominator times want even break little bit always even simplify little bit square root top square root bottom actually write square root let know let get feel let put calculator square root getting roughly equal point two five rounding dividing four point divided getting one nine point five six five area would case nine point five six two five think originally case would nine point five six two inch es thats nothing crazy know maybe formula super familiar kind forget time time actually certainly nice useful know youve got remember formula side length without much anything know normally base times height use know base times height formula well figure height triangle kind dodge need business formula example formula example formula example formula example formula example formula example formula example formula example formula example formula example formula example formula example formula example formula example formula example formula example formula example formula example formula example formula example formula example formula example formula example formula example formula example formula example formula example formula example formula example formula example formula example formula example formula example formula example formula example formula example formula example
