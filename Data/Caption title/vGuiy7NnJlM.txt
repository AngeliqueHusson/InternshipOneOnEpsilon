what 's up everyone welcome to thislesson where we 're going to explore thedifferent triangle congruence theoremsso let 's start out by asking thequestion what does congruence even meanwe like to think of it as this equalsign with the squiggly line over itlet 's just take a few moments to reallyconceptualize what congruence meansespecially in terms of figures so let'slook at a running shoe if I can somehowduplicate this running she would make anexact replica I would say that these twoshoes are congruent because they areexactly the same size and shape now evenif I change the color of one of theshoes or I rotate it around a certainnumber of degrees it 's still congruentto the original sneaker because it 's thesame size and shape and we want toextend this kind of thinking now tocomparing triangles to see whether ornot they are congruent if theircorresponding sides and angles have thesame measure then we can say that thetriangles are congruent and this applieseven when the figures do n't have thesame orientation and visually it 's notso easy to tell whether or not thesetriangles are congruent and this iswhere our theorems are going to comeinto play so the goal of this lesson isto help you to understand why thetheorems that we use prove congruenceand how to know which theorem to use ina particular situation so here are thefive triangle theorems with theirabbreviations we have side side sideside angle side angle side angle angleangle side and hypotenuse leg so nowwe 're ready to go ahead and explore eachtheorem individually now the side sideside triangle congruence theorem statesthat if in two triangles we have threepairs of corresponding sides that arecongruent to each other that means thatthey have the same length then that'senough information to say that thetriangles are congruent to each otherwhich again just means that bothtriangles are exactly the same size andshape so in this instance we can use theside-side-side theorem to conclude thatthe triangles are congruentand that their corresponding sides andcorresponding angles have the samemeasure and remember that thisrelationship is still true even if thefigures have different orientation ournext theorem is side-angle-side now forthis triangle congruence theorem westart with a pair of correspondingcongruent sides and two triangles wealso have a pair of corresponding anglesthat are congruent and another set ofcorresponding sides that are congruentnow see that the letter a is in betweenthe two S 's in the name of the theoremthis corresponds with that congruentangle being in between the two congruentsides now when this is the case we haveenough information to say that the twotriangles are congruent by using theside-angle-side theoremour next congruence theorem is the angleside angle theorem when we have twotriangles with a pair of correspondingcongruent angles a pair of correspondingcongruent sides and another pair ofcorresponding congruent angles we haveenough information to prove congruenceusing angle side angle now it'simportant to notice that the congruentside is in between the two congruentangles and now we can visualize thatwhen this is the case we have enoughinformation to prove that the twotriangles are congruent by angle sideangle which means that all of theircorresponding sides and correspondingangles have the same measurenow our next theorem is very similar tothe one that we just looked at which wasangle side angle this one is calledangle angle side now when in twotriangles we have a pair ofcorresponding congruent angles alongwith a second pair of correspondingcongruent angles as well as a pair ofcorresponding congruent sides now wedo n't want to confuse the last theoremangle side angle and this theorem ofangle angle side because both of theminvolve two congruent angles and onecongruent side the difference is that anangle angle side the congruent anglesare consecutive that is that they areone after the other and then thecongruent side is next to them and setupin between them now even though theorder is different we still have enoughinformation here to prove that these twotriangles are congruent which meansagain that their corresponding sides andcorresponding angles have the samemeasure now our final congruence theoremis kind of a special case it 's calledhypotenuse leg and it applies to righttriangles onlyso let 's start out with the key featureof any right triangle that is a rightangle now we know that the hypotenuse ofa right triangle is its longest side andis always opposite the right angle sothis congruence theorem says that if thehypotenuse in both right triangles arecongruent and if a leg which is one ofthe other sides are congruent that isthey have a pair of correspondingcongruent sides and that is enough tosay that the two triangles are congruentagain which means that the trianglescorresponding sides and correspondingangles have the same measure so now thatwe 've covered the five trianglecongruence theorems you may be askingwhat about angle side side please don'tbe uptight okay so now let 's go aheadand explore why angle side side wouldnot work as a triangle congruencetheorem so if we have a set ofcorresponding angles that are congruentand a set of corresponding sides thatare congruent okay so we have two setswe have an angle followed by twoconsecutive congruent sides the issue iswith that second congruent side since wedo n't know the angle in between the twocongruent sides we do n't exactly knowits position so I could take that sideand swing it over to a new location andstill show that angle side side is stillthe case here no matter how I choose todraw that second triangle and I have theoption of drawing in either way sincethat 's an isosceles triangle so both ofthose sides are definitely congruent toeach other now if I draw it this way asan acute triangle I see that I haveangle side sidehowever the base of each triangleclearly are not the same and thesetriangles clearly are not congruentthank you so much guys for checking usout please subscribe to our YouTubechannel for more free animated mathlessons updated every week test
