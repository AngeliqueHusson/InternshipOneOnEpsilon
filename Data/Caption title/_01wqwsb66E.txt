find common factor monomial snow common factor anything factor divisible talking pure case monomial snow little bit careful talk context algebraic expression like point view include factor necessarily possible number maybe take negative value maybe taking value less square actually going become smaller number think without getting much weed think kind run process understand little bit find common factor let essentially break could call prime factorization kind combination prime factorization part number plus essentially factorization variable write squared rewrite product prime factor prime factorization times prime broken times broken c n know anything else c broken times times c squared written times mean writing monomial essentially product part prime factor sand rest kind expanding exponent snow let third squared right times equal times c third times c times c times cand squared times squared squared times times common factor context well least one least one c let take one c right two common factor context factor two monomial sis going factor going equal times one c common times common times times equal squared kind view put depending whether c negative positive greater less common factor two monomial sit divisible factor possible finding common factor two monomial algebra khan academy finding common factor two monomial algebra khan academy finding common factor two monomial algebra khan academy finding common factor two monomial algebra khan academy finding common factor two monomial algebra khan academy
