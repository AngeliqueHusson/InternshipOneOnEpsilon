Find the greatest common factor of these monomials.Now , the greatest common factor of anythingis the largest factor that 's divisible into both.If we 're talking about just pure numbers , into both numbers , or in this case , into both monomials.Now , we have to be a little bit carefulwhen we talk about greatest in the contextof algebraic expressions like this.Because it 's greatest from the point of viewthat it includes the most factors of each of thesemonomials.It 's not necessarily the greatest possible numberbecause maybe some of these variablescould take on negative values , maybethey 're taking on values less than 1.So if you square it , it 's actuallygoing to become a smaller number.But I think without getting too much into the weeds there , I think if we just kind of run through the process of it , you 'll understand it a little bit better.So to find the greatest common factor , let 's just essentially break down eachof these numbers into what we couldcall their prime factorization.But it 's kind of a combination of the prime factorizationof the numeric parts of the number , plus essentially the factorizationof the variable parts.If we were to write 10cd squared , we can rewrite that as the productof the prime factors of 10.The prime factorization of 10 is just 2 times 5.Those are both prime numbers.So 10 can be broken down as 2 times 5.c can only be broken down by c.We do n't know anything else that c can be broken into.So 2 times 5 times c.But then the d squared can be rewritten as d times d.This is what I mean by writing this monomial essentiallyas the product of its constituents.For the numeric part of it , it 's the constituentsof the prime factors.And for the rest of it , we 're justkind of expanding out the exponents.Now , let 's do that for 25c to the third d squared.So 25 right here , that 's 5 times 5.So this is equal to 5 times 5.And then c to the third , that 's times c times c times c.And then d squared , times d squared.d squared is times d times d.So what 's their greatest common factor in this context ? Well , they both have at least one 5.Then they both have at least one c over here.So let 's just take up one of the c 's right over there.And then they both have two d's.So the greatest common factor in this context , the greatestcommon factor of these two monomialsis going to be the factors that they have in common.So it 's going to be equal to this 5 times -- we only have onec in common , times -- and we have twod 's in common , times d times d.So this is equal to 5cd squared.And so 5d squared , we can kind of view it as the greatest.But I 'll put that in quotes dependingon whether c is negative or positiveand d is greater than or less than 0.But this is the greatest common factor of these two monomials.It 's divisible into both of them , and it uses the most factors possible . test
