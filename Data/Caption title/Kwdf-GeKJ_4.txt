[ Music ] Lehigh is me and we 're doing a wholepolynomial division that you 're happyabout itlet 's get started just to remind you alltotally no meals operate in a basicmachine so you do n't know what 's goingon alright so first problem today we got2x cubed plus 2x squared minus 3x plus 2so here 's that and we 're going to dividethat by X / - okay so just like we didlast time you look for the pattern inthe bottom on the top and then you pushout but oh what look at that you canthere 's only one pattern at the bottomand so you could try to unexploded butthat would n't work here because this isa base X machine so you do n't know thevalue you 'd have to unexploded niftything about this is that you can add anyamount of dots to any of these boxeswhile keeping the value of each box thesame let me show you if I were to put inone dot like this that would be addingone to the two x squared box but if Iwas to add in one ended up like thatthat was the tracked one so these tworight here will be zero and since youneed two more of these guys you can justadd two of these things in not two ofthese days and so you found this poemand now you have these guys so there yougo you have two of these but what aboutall the rest well you can do the samething with the negative numbers that youcan do with the positive ones you canfind the same pattern in the bottom sohere you go right here there 's one ofthe problems this one 's a pattern so andthen you can either same thing where youget one positive dot one F dotso for this pattern boom and boom everytime you see the pattern on the bottomrepeated in the top you get to replacethat with a dot just like thatyeah just like that just like that butoh what auntie docks well - no problemjust as visibility guys have played themwith an auntie doctor the negative sothere you have it this is the finalanswer just like that the 2x cubed plus2x squared minus 3x plus 2 divided by Xplus 2 equals 2x squared minus 2x plus 1all rightyou solve that last row on top we 'll getready boys and or girls to buckle yourseat belts because we 're about to getcrazy get crazy with this new samplewe 're going to do gon na be crazy everystars is alrightnew problem new day let 's get startedtop it is X cubed minus 3x squared minusX plus 3 and that 's being divided by Xplus 1 got that alright so let 's do whatwe did before and find the bought thepattern of the bottom and repeat it atthe top oh look at thatoh no there 's more that we have to doyou ca n't find any more patterns I knowyou 're thinking to yourself all weekjust do what we saw in my last video andget a zero in there with a da dandy doneand I would have a nice grouping wrongyou ca n't do that because it will createmore problems in the futurelook at this you have four negativeshere in the end for anti dots right hereand so you have to put a buck these guysis over in here and it creates more andmore and more until until it is too manyto countso let 's sound something different yousee how we 're dividing it by X minus 1well what 's the opposite of that what'sthe inverse it 'd be negative x plus 1 sowe can actually find that pattern in thetop by creating this C so here you havethe inverse pattern of that or anegative one work I forgot to move thisone sorry about that so you have thishere right I 'll finish what you starteddo that you ca n't you got ta get this guyso there you go for that and oh look atthat you can get even more inversesopportunities are infinite not reallythe only three you can see but here youhave it so we have we 're going toreplace each of these patterns withadult according to their value so righthere this is a positive pattern in thebottom so we place that with one but asyou can see this right here is aninverse pattern so we 'll place I wantthe mini Hertz dot just like that soit 's a negative did I get rinse andrepeat [ Music ] mister peace with these guys right hereand you it 's done we 're done we 're goodwe have x squared or the answer to Xcubed minus 3x squared minus X plus 3divided by X minus 1 isx squared minus two X minus three thathas done we 're done nowall right thanks Rockies Oh what is thisinto my good friend goldfish I think youwere expending celebrity cameo but hereit is so look at this guyalright thanks for watching this hasbeen me yelling at you about dots forlike I do n't know how many minutes isprobably like editing is weird yeah yeahanyway goodbye thanks for watching seeya next videoi'ma go get snacks everybody 's lost [ Music ] test
