good eye welcome to take math troublewell we could be having a look at inthis video is a way of really quicklyand easily working out how long it takesan amount to double whether it be apopulation or money you 're putting thebank how long it would take to doubleand a given interest rate that 's beingcompounded okay it 's not that bad okaythe way that we so pretty much whatwe 're looking at is hello it would takesomething say yeah did we come twice anamount and a given growth rate okay yeahthe way that we do this is as follows weuse this thing called the rule of 72 nowthe rule of 72 is spin around for a fairwhile and it works as follows the timetaken okay so this time taken which isin years equals 72 divided by the growthrate okay so this is the growth ratewhether there 's be an interest rate orwhether the owner or there this be sayyou know the population is growing atfive percent or something like this iswhat I mean by this growth rate so thatis simply we can add its most simple wecan do the followingso say I wanted to know at ten percenthow long it would takeso say interest rate is 10 percent sowhat we would do is we would get 72 andwe would divide by 10 so this would takeseven point two years so we had saysomething at five percent okay so whatwe 're doing is we go 72 divided by 5 weget fourteen point four years so we putsomething at three percentokay 72 divided by three is going to be24 years so we did something at onepercent as you 'll probably see hereseventy-two divided by one it would takeyou 72 years now this is anapproximation this is not exactly theexact exact but it 's fairly it 's that'snot too bad at all and funnily enoughwhat you can really start to notice withthis is how much difference a percentagepoint can make in terms of growth okayso we do this at two percent we couldsay at two percent growth it would take36 years that 's a 12 year difference inthe time it takes something to doublebetween 2 % and 3 % okay if we say 4 % thatway we would n't be at 18 years okaythat 's still a fair degree of differencebetween you know either side there sothat 's a really really handy niftylittle rule there hopefully you like itI find it quite handy actually that'sone of those things that 's really reallygood to know it does n't it 's not thathard to remember all or even use anywayhopefully like that video see you nexttime bye Rule of 72 for compound interest Rule of 72 for compound interest Rule of 72 for compound interest
