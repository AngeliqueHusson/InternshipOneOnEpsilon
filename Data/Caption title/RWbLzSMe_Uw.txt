welcome to finish off my series of forgeometry formers explained let me nowtalk about the surface area of a sphereArchimedes did this once he hit theformula for the volume of a sphere isnow it 's pretty quick and easy to get aform of for the surface of the sphere aswell so here 's a sphere and well sumusradius R radius R and from the form forthe volume being 4/3 PI R cubed here'sour deduce that the surface area thisbeast is 4 PI R squared and let me showyou how we did is you imagine that thesphere is covered with lots littletriangular region so you triangular thesevere basically and tons of thesethings all over and we assume that eachtriangle is basically flat now it 's notgonna be the sphere exactly it could bereally close approximation of the spherebut we could do it this way and he saidthen okay for each of these littletriangular regions we 'll do one overhere draw radii to the center of thesphere for this particular region hereand let 's suppose the area that triangleis be one our court base one the firsttriangle base of triangle one be onethere we go so what is the volume ofthat particular little shape it 's a conenow we 've learnt in a previous video thevolume of cone is 1/3 the area the basetimes the height so the volume of thiscone is 1/3 its base times its height asheight it 's not exactly R but it'sreally close to our and that we do itfor the next cone next to it so it'svolume be 1/3 its base times R and so onI do do this for all the triangles Ihave floating around in fact if I take acommon factor of 1/3 and come effectover R I 'm left with B 1 plus B 2 plus B3 I 'm going to do this for all theparticular triangles that cover theentire sphere this gives anapproximation for the volume of a spherein fact we could argue that if we didtighter and tighter triangles theflatness of them will give a better abetter approximation the sphere so itwould be so much for worry and the trueheight of these little cones wouldactually closer to being truly armed soArchimedes argued that you did finer andfarapproximations this formula really mustbecome the true volume of the cone whichwe know is 4/3 PI R cubed this is whatAlchemy 's argued 1/3 we make sense ofour we make sense of as we do fine andfine approximations these bees arereally just the areas of triangles thatcover the sphere this wants to be thesurface area so he deduced from thisthat she did finally find approximationsthis this form it becomes more and moreexact so we could say that 1/3 times Rtimes the surface every sphere reallydoes want to become 4/3 PI R cubed truevolume multiplied both sides by 3 divideboth sides by r and the left withconcluding that the surface area spheremust be 4 PI R squared which is amazingactually that 's really quite an amazingformula what it says that is if you tookthe equator and imagine this the circlesitting inside the earth this way withradius R that for those bits of materialwe cut them out and mitt to or couldflop and cover these serves the earthperfectly the surface the earth is justfour of those circles there that 's quitea surprise in herethat 's Archimedes achievement comingfrom the volume of the sphereyou might reduce the surface area is 4PI R squared absolutely wonderful thankyou test
