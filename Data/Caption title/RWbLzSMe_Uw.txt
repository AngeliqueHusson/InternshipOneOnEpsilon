welcome finish series geometry let surface area hit formula volume sphere pretty quick easy get form surface sphere aswell sphere well r radius r form volume pi r cube sour deduce surface area beast pi r squared let show imagine sphere covered lots little triangular region triangular severe basically assume triangle basically flat sphere exactly could close approximation sphere could way said little triangular region well one draw radii center sphere particular region let suppose area triangle one court base one first triangle base triangle one one go volume particular little shape weve learnt previous video volume cone area base times height volume cone base times height exactly r really close next cone next volume base times r triangle floating around fact take common factor come effect r left b plus b plus going particular triangle cover entire sphere give approximation volume sphere fact could argue tight er triangle flatness give better better approximation sphere would much worry true height little cones would actually closer truly armed argue finer formula really must become true volume cone know pi r cube argue make sense make sense fine fine approximation bees really triangle cover sphere want surface area deduce finally find form becomes exact could say times r times surface every sphere really want become pi r cube true volume sides divide sides r left concluding surface area sphere must pi r squared amazing actually thats really quite amazing formula say took equator imagine circle sitting inside earth way radius r material cut mitt could flop cover serve earth perfectly surface earth four circle thats surprise thats achievement coming volume sphere might reduce surface area r squared absolutely wonderful thank formula surface area sphere video tan ton mathematics formula surface area sphere video tan ton mathematics formula surface area sphere video tan ton mathematics formula surface area sphere video tan ton mathematics formula surface area sphere video tan ton mathematics formula surface area sphere video tan ton mathematics formula surface area sphere video tan ton mathematics formula surface area sphere video tan ton mathematics
