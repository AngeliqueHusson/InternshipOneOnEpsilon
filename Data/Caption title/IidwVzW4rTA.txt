we have seen examples in which the baseof the logarithm is 10 or sometimes it'se log to the base e is also written asLn of the natural logarithm why is itcalled the natural logarithm we will seethat in another video but for now youshould note that these two are the mostcommonly used bases in logarithms base10 and base E and most of the scientificor the financial calculators have one orboth of these two logarithms so whatwould we do if we are asked to find thevalue of log eight to the base threeusing a calculator we ca n't find thisvalue right that 's where the change ofbase formula comes into the picture thechange of base formula states that logof a to the base B can be written as logof a to the base x over log of B to thebase X log of a to any base x over logof B to that same base X the bases inthe numerator and the denominator shouldbe the same of course the normalconditions about the base and theargument will still exist the base or inthis case X will be greater than zeroand X will not be equal to one and thearguments a and B will be greater thanzero this is the change of base formulaquite easy to remember actually theargument becomes the numerator the basebecomes the denominator and the baseshere will be the same and can beanything coming back to our question howdo we find the value of log of 8 to thebase 3 because the calculator can'treally help us with this we can write itas log of 8 to the base e over log of 3to the base e the argument was writtenin the numerator the base in thedenominator and the common base waschosen as e the calculator can give usthese two values here 's a scientificcalculator we can see that we are giventhe natural log and the log to the base10 buttons we are interested in thenatural log here the numerator is thenatural logof eight the natural log of eightapproximately gives us 2.0 seven ninefour so we write two point zero sevennine four in the numerator in thedenominator we have the natural log ofthree that will approximately give us1.0986 we write this in the denominatorand this value can be easily calculatedusing the calculator two point zeroseven nine four over 1.0986will give us one point eight nine towait approximately that 's one of theways in which change of base helps ussome calculators also give us the valueof log to the base 10 so this can alsobe written as log of eight to the baseten over log of three to the base tenlet 's see what this gives us log to thebase 10 can also be written as log logimplies log to the base 10 log of eightgives us this approximately zero pointnine zero three one now we move on tothe denominator log of three will giveus this zero point four seven seven onewhat do you think this value should beequal to zero point nine zero three onedivided by zero point four seven sevenone gives us this one point eight nineto eight approximately it 's the samevalue and it has to be the same valuethe log of a to the base three has justone value and it 's this does n't matterhow we calculate it that was the changeof base formula and with this formulathere 's one other minor property we canderive we know this formula now if wedivide the numerator and the denominatorby log of a to the base X we get thislook at the denominator now what willthis be equal to using the change ofbase formula again it will equal log ofB to the base a it will equal this weget log of a to the base be equal to oneover log B to the base a and multiplyingboth sides with log of B to the base awill result in thisof a to the base be multiplied by log ofB to the base a will equal oneyou Logarithms – Change of Base Logarithms – Change of Base Logarithms – Change of Base
