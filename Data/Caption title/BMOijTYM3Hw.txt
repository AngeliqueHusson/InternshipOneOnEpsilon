Hello , everybody.I 've got a mathematical card trick for you today.So I 'm going to use mathematics to predict a card.First of all , let 's shuffle the pack.Now , I 've got no fancy shuffles , so I 'll just do something like this.And I 'm going to split the packinto two halves.Two halves of twenty-six cards.That 's not the mathematical bit.So let 's split the pack into two halves.1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 56 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10,11 , 12 , 13 , 14 , 15,16 , 17 , 18 , 19 , 20,21 , 22 , 23 , 24 , 25 , 26.All right -- just tidy those up.Put those over there , because we do n't need them for now.And we 're going to use this half of the packand I can shuffle it if I wantto make three pilesand then count up to ten.So three piles , count up to ten.Picture cards count as ten.Five , six , seven , eight , nine , ten.And seven , eight , nine , ten.Right . If I add up the values of the cards , what have I got ? I 've got jack is a ten , fifteen , twenty-two.OK , I 'm going to take the twenty-second cardin the pile.Well , we 've got three piles here.So I 'm going to say the card is a nine , and -- what -- the right-most is a diamond , we 've got two spades , a diamond -- OK , so I 'm going to say it 's a diamond , so I 'm going to say that the twenty-second cardin the pack is the nine of diamonds.OK , let 's do it.Let 's take the pack , and count out the twenty-second card.1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 56 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10,11 , 12 , 13 , 14 , 15,16 , 17 , 18 , 19 , 20,21 -- the twenty-second card is the nine of diamonds.Let 's have a look.And it is ! And that 's how you use mathematicsto predict a card.So if you have been , thanks for watching . test
