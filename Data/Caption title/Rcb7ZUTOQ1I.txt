If we know some circle has an area of 36pi -- so it has an area of 36pi -- can wefigure out what the circumference of this circleis ? And I encourage you to pause this video , and try to think about that question.Well , from the area , we could figure out what the radius is , and then from that radius , we can figure outwhat its circumference is.So we know that the area , which is 36pi , is equal to pi r squared.And so if you look at it on both sides of this equation , if we divide -- let me rewrite it so it 's a little bit clearerin a different color.So we could set up an equation pi r squared is equal to 36pi.Now , if we want to solve for the radiusthe first thing that we might want to dois divide both sides by pi.Then , we 're left with r squared is equal to 36.Now , if we just solve this as a pure math equation , you might say , OK , we could take the positive and negativesquare root of 36.r could be plus or minus 6 , but weneed to remember that r is a distance , so we only care about the positive.So if we take the principal root of 36 , we get r is equal to 6.From there , we can use this to figure out the circumference.So the circumference is equal to 2 pi r.Circumference is equal to 2 pi r.And in this case , r is equal to 6.So it 's equal to 2 pi times 6 , whichis going to be equal to 12pi.So that 's straightforward , area 36pi , we leverage pi rsquared to figure out that the radius was 6 , and then from that we were able to figure outthat the circumference was 12pi . test
