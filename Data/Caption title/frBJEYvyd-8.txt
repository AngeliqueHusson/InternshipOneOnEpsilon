We 're told to plot these values on a number line.And you see every one of these values have anabsolute value sign.So let 's take a little bit of a review of what absolutevalue even is.The way I think about it , there 's two waysto think about it.The first way to think about it is , how far issomething from 0 ? So let me plot this negative 3 here.So let me do a number line.This is n't the number line for our actual answer , or to thiscommand -- plot these values on a number line.I 'm just first going to plot the numbers inside theabsolute value sign , and then we 're going to take theabsolute value and plot those , just like they'reasking us to do.So on this number line , if this is 0 , if we go to thenegative , we 're going to go to the left of 0.So this is negative 1 , negative 2 , negative 3.Negative 3 sits right over there , so this is negative 3right there.The absolute value of negative 3 is essentially saying , howfar are you away from 0 ? How far is negative 3 from 0 ? And you say , well , it's 1 , 2 , 3 away from 0.So you 'd say that the absolute value of negative 3 is equalto positive 3.Now that 's really the conceptual way to imagineabsolute value.How far are you away from 0 ? But the easy way to calculate absolute value signs , if youdo n't care too much about the concept , is whether it'snegative or positive , the absolute value of it 's alwaysgoing to be positive.Absolute value of negative 3 is positive 3.Absolute value of positive 3 is still positive 3.So you 're always going to get the positive version of thenumber , so to speak.But conceptualy , you 're just saying how far awayare you from 0.So let 's do what they asked.So that first value , on this number line , so all of theseare absolute values.So they 're all going to be positive values.So they 're all going to be greater than 0.So let me draw my number line , like this.I can do a straighter number line than that.Let 's see.Well , that 's a little bit straighter.And let 's say , if this is 0 , this would be negative 1 , thenyou 'd have 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7.I think that 'll do the trick.So this first quantity here -- I 'll do it in orange -- theabsolute value of negative 3 , we just figured out , that ispositive 3.So I 'll plot it right over there , positive 3.Then this next value , right here , the absolute value of 7.If we look over here , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7.7 is how far away from 0 ? It is 7 away from 0.So the absolute value of 7 is equal to 7.So you already see the pattern there.If it 's negative , it just becomes positive.If it 's already positive , it just equals itself.So plotting this value , I 'll just placeit right over there.So the absolute value of 7 is 7.Absolute value of negative 3 is positive 3.Let me mark out the 0 a little bit better , so you seerelative to 0.Now we have the absolute value of 8 minus 12.Well , first of all , let 's figure out what 8 minus 12 is.So if you take 12 away from 8 , you 're at negative 4.12 less than 8 is negative 4.And you can do that on a number line if you do n't quiteremember how to do this.But if you , you know , if you take 8 away from 8 , you 're at0 , and then you take another one , you 're at negative 1 , negative 2 , negative 3 , all the way to negative 4.So this is equal to the absolute value of negative 4.If we just plot negative 4 , we go 1 , 2 , 3 , negative 4 isright over there.But if we 're taking its absolute value , we 're sayinghow far is negative 4 from 0 ? Well it 's 4 away from 0.1 , 2 , 3 , 4.So this is equal to positive 4.So we 'll plot it right here.This number line is the answer to this command up here.So the absolute value of 8 minus 12 , which is negative 4 , is positive 4.Then we have the absolute value of 0.So how far is 0 from 0 ? Well , it 's 0 away from 0.The absolute value of 0 is 0 , so you can just plot it rightover there.And we have one left.Let me pick a suitable color here.The absolute value of 7 minus 2.Well , 7 minus 2 is 5 , so this is the same thing as theabsolute value of 5.How far is 5 away from 0 ? Well , it 's just 5 away.It 's almost , you know , too easy.That 's what makes it confusing.If I were to plot 5 , it 's 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5.It is 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 spaces from 0.So the absolute value of 5 is 5.So you plot it just like that.So conceptually , it 's how far you are away from 0.But if you think about it in kind of just very simpleterms , if it 's a negative number , it becomes a positiveversion of it.If it 's a positive number already , it just equals itselfwhen you take the absolute value . test
