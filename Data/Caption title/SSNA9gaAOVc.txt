comma negative solution plus equal two ways think could substitute x value equation see well way first graph equation could see point graph would also mean solution equation let first plus equal let substitute instead x let us put x times plus times negative plus times negative needs equal put question mark sure yet times times negative negative left hand side minus needs equal course minus equal works solution question also want show way substitution graph equation could also graphically let give graph equation setting multiple ways graph could put slope intercept form rest set table x value sand graph given graph want see actually obviously already shown fact could try point negative actually graph could table wo n going give graph let try x equal times plus times equal x equal going going plus equal going equal x equal plus equal subtract sides get equal get equal x x well well actually enough us graph could keep could even put point negative let try graph rough sense right let draw x axis right let draw point let say negative negative negative negative could keep going direction little bit could keep going positive x direction let plot point si x x draw line dotted line make sure connect dot si better job though look something like someone gave line say oh well negative line let assume drew really nicely scalelet try one last attempt going look something like someone ked negative could visually always hard actually n substitute n know maybe little bit look say x equal well go equal negative point comma negative general n want rely inspect ing negative tell looking graph always want substitute make sure really equal equality really hold true point looking graph important realize graph really another representation equation ordered pair solution equation graph ing slope algebra basic khan academy ordered pair solution equation graph ing slope algebra basic khan academy ordered pair solution equation graph ing slope algebra basic khan academy ordered pair solution equation graph ing slope algebra basic khan academy ordered pair solution equation graph ing slope algebra basic khan academy
