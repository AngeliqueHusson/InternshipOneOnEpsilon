now you can see what I 'm gon na do I'veby the way I 've rubbed off my lineswhich I know you might not wan na do asyou go just so you can see it moreclearly because it gets pretty busy withall these lines flying around so 15.4 isgonna be here right okaynow what you 'll notice is especially ifyou have done this like on your piece ofpaper and you know your LED pencil orwhatever you 're using it has width rightso as you go across I think most of youwill find that it 's somewhere in betweenhere and here now do you see that now ifI go all the way down to the bottom it'sfive to six okay that 's that 's thenumbers I 'm reading at the bottom nowjust pause for a moment before I answerthe question what should I actually sayif you 're between five and six then ifyou ask someone who 's like five yearsand say 11 months old if you have somehow old are you what would you answerokay so at that very small age you mightdo it in half supporters or whatever butjust generally speaking you 'd say I'mfive well I have n't turned six yetyou 're not six until you 've passed rightover six so everyone in here in thisspace here they 're all what we wouldcall five years on okay so therefore myanswer what age group is the median BMIequal to fifty point four is onfive-year-olds I think that 's the answerokay all right let 's keep going Part Dboys are considered to be obese if theirBMI is greater than the 95th percentilefor their age okay now by the way thisis such a better way of doing thingsthe UM percentiles because as timeprogresses and as culture changes thenumbers themselves will also changeright like everyone here is way tallerthan they were a hundred years agobecause we have better nutrition andhygiene like I do so where 's the 95thpercentile for nineteen year olds have alook you might need to draw yourself avertical line that 's what I 'm gon na doyep okay so when I 've dropped myvertical line up from age 19 and I getin closer for a better view you can seehere 's a here 's 30 let me put in as aseparate color for you here 's 30 andoops a bit I 'm a bit wonky yeah 30 wouldgo straight across there and if you gofive units down that 's where 29 is rightso where does my point land up here I'dprobably say it 's closest to I 'll get mypoint out of the way now it 's quick I'msorry it 's up to about twenty nine pointeight I think that 's the closest okayyou 've got limits of reading here if itwas really close to our point six pointeight that would be okay you 've stillread the thing properly okay and it wasdown to accuracy so I would say a BMIabove twenty nine point eight that meansyou 're above the 95th percentile rightokay let 's talk about this nine-year-oldhis BMI is twenty one point five is heconsidered obese according to this chartso I 'm gon na look for his age his BMIand see where where he 's rated okay solet 's have a looknine years old nine years old so here'smy vertical line up from nine years oldokayand when I look for my 21.5 is that'shalfway between 21 and 22 so yeah that'sright you can see as I draw across to methere he is right there okay so is youabove the 95th percentile it 's up yes soaccording to this chart they wouldclassify him as obese okay they 're gonnaask the same thing for Part II but inReverse they 're looking for underweightso rather than looking above a certainline we 're looking for right yeah you'llbe both a Q so you can see what 's theBMI below which four-year-old boys Iconsidered underweight so 5 % is the it'sthe lowest curvy line rightyeah yeah unfortunately that 's that'snot how via so you can see it looks likeit 's right there do you see it okay yeahthat 's right it looks pretty much bangon 14 so if you 're gon na be my below 14that would be classified as underweighta 13 your boy has a BMI of fifteen pointeight is he under way let 's go acrossthe thirteen years olddraw up your vertical line and what beam I am I looking for again fifteenpoint eight and he looks okaywhat up if you were looking at this andhad to make an estimation what would yousay his percentile is what do you reckonyeah it 's between ten and five betweenfive to ten it 's sort of a little moretowards a ten so it 's like an A or anine or something like thateighth or ninth percentile roughly okayokay we 're on the homestretch Part F theBMI of boys is considered to be normalif it 's between fifth and 85thpercentile so then asked about 17 yearold boys this seems relevant thank youokay so we 're looking for 17 so I'mgoing to draw up my vertical line from17 so you can see I 'm actually not goingto draw the whole line I 'm just going todraw the part that 's relevant to thisquestion right so you can see I 've gotfrom the bottom curvy line the 5thpercentile that guy all the way up tothe 85th one and what 's outside that isirrelevant to me so can you read acrossto the left-hand side what range wouldyou describe what 's the lowest andwhat 's the highest yeah I thinkseventeen point six is pretty much bangon all the way up to 25 exactlyyeah I think oopsy-daisyI probably say 24.8 is closest isclosest right so 25 is close but I thinkour graph gives us more accuracy thanthat last one interquartile range youneed to remember a few things herequartiles right the interquartile rangeis between q1 and q3now this graph does n't tell you whichones they are you have to remember whichpercentile is which so where 's q1 it'sgoing to be 25 right so you may like towrite on the right-hand side here25 is q1 50 that 's the median q2 andthen of course q3 is 75 so you got yourupper and lower quartiles now so whatage group are we interested in now age 8sir you 're gon na have to come over tothe left-hand side and you want tofollow it looks like the fourth linefrom the top and the third line from thebottom for eight-year-oldsokay so I think this is what we'regetting right now remember it 's askingfor an interquartile range so they don'twant you to tell them what the quartilesare they want to know though thedifference between those that 's therange in the quartiles so I need to takethe top one subtract the bottom line itlooks like 17 take away how do you readit yeah I think 14 days when it 's prettymuch bang onso therefore the difference betweenthose is the inter quartile range makesense can you can you ask minute whichlads you 're talking about yep yeah okayso interquartile range is only between25th percentile and the 75th Pacific cuztheir quartiles right so the percentilesinclude the quartiles in them you justgotta know which one okay okay yes yeahthat 's a great question and it 's areally good question to askI need the ages you can see the graphstarts high and then it comes down lownow remember I said the higher thenumbers are the kind of high proportionfactor but then it dips down why is itdipping down what would make think aboutthis what would make a BMI get loweryeah think about this right remember Idid n't I did n't write it up here againBMI is weight over height squaredremember that now I think we'represuming that under normalcircumstances these people are not notIrish so it 's lovely the weight isdecreasing but their high it shoots upright so here we got exactly rightin proportion here this has a bit of agrowth spurt right so this sort of dropsdownand then as you go to the riot why doyou think it continues going up yeahthat 's right sir and that 's because likesort of puny happens around here so theystart to get muscle mass well somepeople I do n't know what happened withthat Deciles and Percentiles (2 of 2: Using Deciles and Percentiles to
