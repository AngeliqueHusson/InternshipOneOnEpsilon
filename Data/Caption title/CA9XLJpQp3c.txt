If you¡¯ve been learning math for a while , then you probably already know a thing or two about fractions.And if you¡¯ve ever had to break a cookie in half to share with a friend , well then you¡¯ve used fractions in real life.Oh¡­ well , thank you¡­ Mmmmm ! That¡¯s because fractions are used to represent smaller pieces or parts of things.When you¡¯re first learning about fractions , it can help to draw pictures to see how they work.So let¡¯s start by drawing a circle.This circle represents what we call a whole.No , not the kind of hole that you could fall into ! More like a whole cookie , or a whole pizza.Now , if we divide that circle , or whole amount , into four parts , then we call each of those parts a fraction of the original whole circle.Because this is Math class and not Art , we can¡¯t just keep on drawing pictures.We need to learn how to write out fractions using the language of math.Yep , you guessed it ! That means using numbers.Unlike a regular number , to write a fraction you need two numbers ; one number on top , one number on bottom , and a line between them.I¡¯ll explain exactly what the line is for later in the video , but for now , let¡¯s figure out what the two numbers mean.Remember , fractions are used to represent parts of something , and the number on the bottom tells us how many parts that something is divided into.The number on top tells us how many of those parts we have . [ 'elevator ' music ] For example , let¡¯s write a fraction for our drawing here.I divided the circle into four parts , right ? So the number on the bottom will be ¡®4¡¯.And I still have all four of those parts , so the number on top will also be ¡®4¡¯.I have ¡®4¡¯ out of ¡®4¡¯ parts . That means I still have a whole circle.But what if someone came by and took away one part from the circle.Well¡­ the circle is still divided into four parts , so the bottom number would still be ¡®4¡¯.But I only have three of those parts left , so that means the top number will change to ¡®3¡¯.So I have ¡®3¡¯ over ¡®4¡¯ , or three-fourths of the circle.¡­make sense so far ? Good ! Let¡¯s try another example.Let¡¯s say that I divide a rectangle up into eight parts , and I give you three of those parts.Since the total number of parts is eight , the bottom number will be ¡®8¡¯ , and since you have three of those parts , the top number will be ¡®3¡¯.So the fraction I¡¯m giving you is¡­ ¡®3¡¯ over ¡®8¡¯ , or three-eighths of the rectangle.No , no , no¡­ no need to thank me.Oh¡­ and it¡¯s important to remember that for fractions to work right , the parts that you divide the whole up into have to be equal.We can¡¯t take like¡­ well¡­ take a candy bar and say , ¡°well I¡¯m gon na divide it into two parts . So this is your half , and here 's my half¡±.Let¡¯s look at a few more examplesso you can really see the pattern of how fractions can represent parts of objects.This rectangle is divided up into three equal parts , and two of them are shaded red.So ¡®2¡¯ over ¡®3¡¯ , or two-thirds of the rectangle is shaded red.This circle is divided into twelve equal parts , and seven of those parts are shaded green.So , ¡®7¡¯ over ¡¯12¡¯ , or seven-twelfths of the circle is shaded green.This hexagon is divided into six equal parts , and five of those parts are shaded blue.So ¡®5¡¯ over ¡®6¡¯ , or five-sixths of the hexagon is shaded blue.Alright , so you can see how fractions can be used to represent parts of objects like circles and rectangles , but fractions can be used for more than that.They can be used to represent parts of¡­ well , anything ! Like¡­ like pets for example.Let¡¯s say you have seven pets ; four dogs , two cats , and a big , fat , hamster.That means that ¡®4¡¯ over ¡®7¡¯ , or four-sevenths of your pets are dogs , and ¡®2¡¯ over ¡®7¡¯ , or two-sevenths of your pets are cats , and ¡®1¡¯ over ¡®7¡¯ , or one-sevenths of your pets are hamsters.It also means that your house probably smells like a pet store . [ laughter ] Okay¡­ so fractions can be used to represent anything from parts of a circle to kitty-cats.But did you know that fractions can also be used represent things you can¡¯t even see ? Well , like a test score for example¡­Let¡¯s say you take a math test and there¡¯s 20 questions on the test , and you get 17 of those questions right.That means that you got ¡¯17¡¯ over ¡¯20¡¯ , or seventeen-twentieths of the questions right.Alright¡­so that¡¯s the basic idea of how fractions can be used to represent parts of things , but there¡¯s a lot more to fractions than that.In the next section , we¡¯re going to be looking at some of the other things we can do with fractions.But before that , let¡¯s review¡­Fractions are used to represent parts of a whole.Fractions are written in the form of a top number over a bottom number with a line between them.The bottom number represents how many parts the whole is divided into.And the top number represents how many of those parts you have.And finally¡­ the parts that a whole is divided up into must be equal for fractions to work right.To really understand how fractions are used to represent parts of things , be sure to do the exercises , and I¡¯ll see you in section two.Learn more at www.mathantics.com Math Antics - Fractions Are Parts Math Antics - Fractions Are Parts Math Antics - Fractions Are Parts
