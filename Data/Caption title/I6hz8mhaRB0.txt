Identify the hypothesis and conclusion of the followingstatement , and determine whether the statement isalways , sometimes , or never true.And the statement here is , the absolute value of x is greaterthan 0 for all real numbers x.Now if I want to decide what the hypothesis and conclusionis here , it 's usually a lot easier to figure them out ifyou rewrite this statement , this exact statement , as anif/then statement.So what this statement is saying is , if x is a realnumber , then the absolute value of x is greater than 0.So let me rewrite that.If x is a real number , then the absolute value of x isgreater than 0.These are equivalent statements.Now when you write it like this , it 's much easier toidentify the hypothesis and the conclusion.The hypothesis you can view as it 's the if part of thisproposition.So this right here is the hypothesis.x is a real number.That is the hypothesis.And the conclusion is the then part.Sometimes it 's called the consequent.It 's this part right here.It 's this part , x.Absolute value of x is greater than 0.This is the conclusion or the consequent.And over here , if you wanted to circle them , this is theconclusion.That is the conclusion.And the hypothesis is for all real numbers.It 's a little bit easier to identify when you see itwritten like this.This is the hypothesis.Now I do n't want you to get confused with the idea of ascientific hypothesis , which is related buta little bit different.A scientific hypothesis is an explanation for some phenomenathat can be tested.So a scientific hypothesis might be something likesaying , blueberries -- which I 'm writing in blueintentionally.Blueberries help reduce the risk of cancer.This right here is a scientific hypothesis.You could then go feed a bunch of people blueberries for along period of time and see if they have a less likelihood ofdeveloping cancer than people who never got blueberries andeverything else is equal.And so it would be testable.You could see if it 's true.And the conclusion would be whether this is true or not.But this is in the scientific hypothesis world , not to beconfused with the notion of hypothesis thatwe 're using right now.And I do n't want to confuse you too much , so I 'm justgoing to leave this on the side here.But when you 're in Algebra I and especially -- these areaccording to the California standards.The hypothesis in this context is the antecedent of thisproposition.Or it 's the if part of this proposition.Now , the more interesting question iswhether it is true.I mean , we can sit and label statements all day , but that'snot interesting.The more fundamental thing is , is this a true statement ? Is it true that if x is a real number , then the absolutevalue of x is greater than 0 ? Well the one number that pops out of my mind that disprovesthis is if x is 0.0 is a real number.That 's true.But -- and I 'll write but in caps.BUT the absolute value of 0 is equal to 0.It 's not greater than 0.So this disproves this statement.It 's definitely not always true.Now , if you pretty much have any other real number , thiswill be true.Because any other real number is some distance away from 0.That 's what the absolute value measures.So if you took a 1 or a negative 1 or whatever , theabsolute value of those are greater than 0.So this is sometimes true .
