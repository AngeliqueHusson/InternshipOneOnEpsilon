presentation going learn graph trig function without kind graph point point hopefully presentation also trig function able figure actual analytic definition function well let say f x let make sure right let say f x equal sine x look couple interesting thing different regular sine function well multiplying whole function also coefficient x term seen video made know term affect amplitude term period inverse period frequency either way depend whether talking one inverse one let start amplitude tell us amplitude function going amplitude would going times let draw little dotted line equal another dotted line equal negative know amplitude know function going somehow oscillate two point figure fast going oscillate two point period give little formula function equal amplitude times let say sine would also work cosine amplitude function times sine divided period function times x right p might completely obvious comes want maybe video maybe future video well experiment see change coefficient think start make sense equation let take kind act faith right divided period coefficient x say divided period equal coefficient know extremely messy separate divided period equal could say period equal period equal know amplitude equal period equal figure period equal used formula divided period coefficient set divided period equal solve period start well f well x equal whole term sine sine remember guess could use calculator thats something remember could relook unit circle remind sine times f draw right know period mean function going repeat go repeat back kind draw function take little bit practice actually draw explore little bit well function going look like oh boy difficult thought keep going direction well notice period could distance long take function repeat go one cycle could also want could measure distance distance would also period function course amplitude function right amplitude period figured equation another way could thought let say let erase stuff let say didnt stuff right say n know function let get rid stuff saw graph ked go graph try figure function would see long take function repeat well take radian function repeat able visually realize period function would say well amplitude amplitude easy would see high goes goes right amplitude n whole swing much swing positive negative direction amplitude wrong color period question would well oscillating periodic function sine cosine function well cosine function assuming shifting future module shift along x axis assuming shifting cosine sine function well going sine function would use formula x equal amplitude times sine period times x would know function f x equal amplitude times sine period x course cancel cancel becomes sine xi know little difficult read ask question would function look like f x equal cosine x well going look going different point cosine x equal whole term equal learned f equal write f equal different draw cosine function different color would start equal everything else amplitude period going look like hope n mess difficult function going look like going go going rise side going thing keep going notice cosine sine awfully similar way differentiate well general easiest way happen input function happen axis x equal angle input equal unless shifting n worry shifting future module sine cosine would since multiplying times factor right times number right becomes graph cosine x graph sine x little bit preview shifting notice pink graph cosine x similar green graph way well case pi right actually something period coefficient general cosine x actually sine x left n want confuse much time video another video couple like graph ing trig function graph ing trig function graph ing trig function graph ing trig function graph ing trig function graph ing trig function graph ing trig function graph ing trig function graph ing trig function graph ing trig function graph ing trig function graph ing trig function graph ing trig function graph ing trig function graph ing trig function graph ing trig function graph ing trig function graph ing trig function
