In this presentation we're going to learn how to graphtrig functions without having to kind ofgraph point by point.And hopefully after this presentation you can also lookat a trig function and be able to figure out the actualanalytic definition of the function as well.So let 's start.Let 's say f of x.Let me make sure I 'm using all the right tools.So let 's say that f of x is equal to 2 sine of 1/2 x.So when we look at this , a couple interesting things here.How is this different than just the regular sine function ? Well , here we 're multiplying the whole function by 2 , and also the coefficient on the x-term is 1/2.And if you 've seen some of the videos I 've made , you 'll knowthat this term affects the amplitude and this term affectsthe period , or the inverse of the period , whichis the frequency.Either way.It depends whether you're talking about one or theinverse of the other one.So let 's start with the amplitude.This 2 tells us that the amplitude of this functionis going to be 2.Because if it was just a 1 there the amplitude would be 1.So it 's going to be 2 times that.So let 's draw a little dotted line up here at y equals 2.And then another dotted line at y equals negative 2.So we know this is the amplitude.We know that the function is going to somehow oscillatebetween these two points , but we have to figure out how fastis it going to oscillate between the two points , or what 's its period.And I 'll give you a little formula here.The function is equal to the amplitude times , let 's say , sine , but it would also work with cosine.The amplitude of the function times sine of 2pi dividedby the period of the function , times x.This right here is a `` p. '' So it might not be completely obvious where this comes from.But what I want you to do is maybe after this video ormaybe in future videos we'll experiment when we see whathappens when we change this coefficient on the x-term.And I think it 'll start to make sense to you whythis equation holds.But let 's just take this as kind of an act of faith rightnow , that 2pi divided by the period is the coefficient on x.So if we say that 2pi divided by the period is equal to thecoefficient , which is 1/2.I know this is extremely messy.And this is separate from this.So 2pi divided by the period is equal to 1/2.Or we could say 1/2 the period is equal to 2pi.Or , the period is equal to 4pi.So we know the amplitude is equal to 2 and theperiod is equal to 4pi.And once again , how did we figure out that theperiod is equal to 4pi ? We used this formula : 2pi divided by the period is thecoefficient on the x-term.So we set 2pi divided by the period equal to 1/2 , and thenwe solved that the period is 4pi.So where do we start ? Well , what is f of 0 ? Well , when x is equal to 0 this whole term is 0.So what 's sine of 0 ? Sine of 0 is 0 , if you remember.I guess you could use a calculator , but that'ssomething you should remember.Or you could re-look at the unit circle to remind yourself.Sine of 0 is 0.And then 0 times 2 is 0.So f of 0 is 0.Right ? We 'll draw it right there.And we know that it has a period of 4pi.That means that the function is going to repeat after 4pi.So if we go out it should repeat back out here , at 4pi.And now we can just kind of draw the function.And this will take a little bit of practice , but -- actually I'mgoing to draw it , and then we can explore it a littlebit more as well.So the function 's going to look like this.Oh , boy.This is more difficult than I thought.And it 'll keep going in this direction as well.And notice , the period here you could do it from here to here.This distance is 4pi.That 's how long it takes for the function to repeat , orto go through one cycle.Or you could also , if you want , you could measure thisdistance to this distance.This would also be 4pi.And that 's the period of the function.And then , of course , the amplitude of the function , which is this right here , is 2.Here 's the amplitude.And then the period of 4pi we figured out from this equation.Another way we could have thought about it , let 's saythat -- let me erase some of the stuff -- let 's say I didn'thave this stuff right here.Let 's say I did n't know what the function was.Let me get rid of all of this stuff.And all I saw was this graph , and I asked youto go the other way.Using this graph , try to figure out what the function is.Then we would just see , how long does it take forthe function to repeat ? Well , it takes 4pi radians for the function to repeat , soyou 'd be able to just visually realize that the periodof this function is 4pi.And then you would say , well what 's the amplitude ? The amplitude is easy.You would just see how high it goes up or down.And it goes up 2 , right ? When you 're doing the amplitude you do n't do the whole swing , you just do how much it swings in the positiveor negative direction.So the amplitude is 2.I 'm using the wrong color.The period is 4pi.And then your question would be , well this isan oscillating , this is a periodic function.Is it a sine or is it a cosine function ? Well , cosine function , assuming we 're not doing any shifting -- and in a future module I will shift along the x-axis -- butassuming we 're not doing any shifting , cosine of 0 is 1.Right ? And sine of 0 is 0.And what 's this function at 0 ? Well , it 's 0.Right ? So this is going to be a sine function.So we would use this formula here.f of x is equal to the amplitude times the sine of 2pidivided by the period times x.So we would know that the function is f of x is equal tothe amplitude times sine of 2pi over the period -- 4pi -- x.And , of course , these cancel out.And then this cancels out and becomes 2 sine of 1/2 x.I know this is a little difficult to read.My apologies.And I 'll ask a question.What would this function look like ? f of x equals 2 cosine of 1/2 x.Well , it 's going to look the same but we 're going tostart at a different point.What 's cosine of 0 ? When x is equal to 0 this whole term is equal to 0.Cosine of 0 , we learned before , is 1.So f of 0 is equal to 2.Let me write that . f of 0 is equal to 2.Let me do this in a different color.Let me draw the cosine function in a different color.We would start here.f of 0 is equal to 2 , but everything else is the same.The amplitude is the same and the period is the same.So now it 's going to look like this.I hope I do n't mess this up.This is difficult.So now the function is going to look like this.And you 're going to go down here , and you 're goingto rise up again here.And on this side you're going to do the same thing.And keep going.So notice , the cosine and the sine functionslook awfully similar.And the way to differentiate them is what they do -- well , what they do in general.But the easiest way is , what happens when you inputa 0 into the function ? What happens at the y-axis , or when x is equal to 0 , or whenthe angle that you input into it is equal 0 ? Unless we 're doing shifting -- and do n't worry about shiftingfor now , I 'll do that in future modules -- sine of 0 is 0while cosine of 0 would be 1.And since we 're multiplying it times this factor right here , times this number right here , the 1 becomes a 2.And so this is the graph of cosine of x.This is this graph of sine of x.And this is a little bit of a preview for shifting.Notice that the pink graph , or cosine of x , is verysimilar to the green graph.And it 's just shifted this way by -- well , in thiscase it 's shifted by pi.Right ? And this actually has something to do with the periodof the coefficient.In general , cosine of x is actually sine of x shiftedto the left by pi/2.But I do n't want to confuse you too much.That 's all the time I have for this video.I will now do another video with a couple of moreexamples like this . test
