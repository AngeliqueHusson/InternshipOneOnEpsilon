the discriminant is this part right herein the quadratic formula the b squaredminus 4ac so without doing the entirequadratic formula you can zero in thatjust on this quantity here b squaredminus 4ac without the square root andyou can find out the nature of the rootsor the number of solutions that thequadratic formula will have and so theway you would do that is you calculatewhat b squared minus 4ac is okay andjust keep in mind that this is in theform ax squared plus BX plus C equals 0so the a is the coefficient front of thex squared term the B is the coefficientin front of the X term and then the C isthe constant make sure everything is onone side and it 's set equal to zero butwhen you calculate this if it 's greaterthan zero meaning that it 's positive youthen want to evaluate is it a perfectsquare like 4 9 16 25 36 if it is thenyou 're going to have two real rationalsolutions if it 's not a perfect squareyou 're going to have two real solutionsbut they 're going to be irrationalmeaning like square roots that you can'tsimplify like square root of 17 orsquare root of 21 now if it comes out to0 you just get one real solution and thereason is is if this is 0 whether youadd 0 or you subtract 0 this quantity isyou know cancelling out you 're justgonna have B over 2a now this is calleda repeated root okay and what that meansis that if you were to factor thequadratic you would get the samesolution twice okay and then the thirdcase is that b squared minus 4ac is lessthan 0 meaning it 's negative thisquantity underneath the square rootwould be negative when you take thesquare root of a negative numberthat 's where you get the imaginarysolutions or what they call it complexsolutions and you 're going to get two ofthose negative B plus that quantitynegative B minus that quantity so let'sget right into these examples and we'lltake a look at how it works so in thisexample you can see that a is 1 B ispositive 5 and C is 4 so if we do our bsquared minus 4ac what do we get Bsquared is 5 squared which is 25 minus 4times a which is 1 times 4 which is theC value so this comes out to 25 minus 16which equals 9 and you can see that 9 isgreater than 0 it 's positive and it 's aperfect square so we get two realrational solutions okay so now we 're notactually solving for what the solutionsare at this pointwe 're just figuring out what 's the typeof solution and how many okay so thenext example we 've got b squared minus4ac okay so let 's write that down so bsquared would be negative 6 squaredminus 4 times a which is 1 okay times Cwhich is 1 and you get 36 minus 4 whichis 32 now notice that 32 is positivemeaning greater than 0 but it 's not aperfect square so we 're getting 2 realbut they 're irrational solutions so twoof them but irrational this one herewe 've got B squared which is 4 squaredminus 4 times a times C which gives us16 minus 16 which equals 0 so you cansee here that 's this case here we haveone real solution but it 's a repeatedsolution what that means is that if youwere to graph this parabola okay thisis n't the exact graph but basically whatit 's going to do is just going to touchthe x-axis just at one point and thatpoints going to be the vertex okay sothen the last case here we 're going todo b squared minus 4ac again so 2squared minus 4 times 3 times 2 that 's 4minus 24 which gives us a negative 20now notice this is less than 0 that'sthis last case here which means we'regoing to get two imaginary solutions orwhat you call complex solution test
