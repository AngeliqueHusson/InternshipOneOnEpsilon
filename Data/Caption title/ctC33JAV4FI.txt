JAMES GRIME : So recently , we had big maths news , did n't we ? We had that new prime number that was found.And it was the biggest prime number ever found.And it was big news.And we were all quite excited about it.It was lots of fun.But it got me thinking about one of the classic proofs inmathematics , and that is the proof that there areinfinitely many primes.So even though we found this huge , 17-million-digit primenumber , it is still not the biggest prime number of all.Because there 's infinitely many of them.So shall we do this classic proof ? So I 'll say before I start that many of you may have seenthis proof before.It goes way back.But for those who have n't seen it before , this is whatmathematicians consider an elegant and a beautiful proof.So we 're going to prove infinitely many primes.To do that , first of all , we 're goingto assume the opposite.So I 'm going to say there are finitely many primes.So if there 's finitely many of them , we can write a list.And let 's do that.And I 'm going to call them prime 1.Do n't know what it is particularly , but let 's callit prime 1.Prime 2 , prime 3 , and I 'll just go on until I get to thelast one , which I'll call prime n.The point I want to make , though , is that this is acomplete list.So that 's important.OK , the next thing I 'm going to do -- I 'm going to make a new number.It 's a whole number.I 'm going to call it Q . So let's call it Q . And to makethis number , I 'm going to multiply all these together -- prime 1 times prime 2 times prime 3 , all the way up to thelast one there , prime n.So there 'll be only one way to write Q . As a product ofprimes , it 's a unique expression.So there 's only one way you can write Q.And then I 'm going to add 1.Q is either prime , or it 's not.That 's the only options it has.If Q is prime , then it 's a new prime that 's not on this list.That 's bad.So hopefully , it's not a prime.If it 's not a prime , then it is made up from primes bymultiplying primes together.Now , those prime factors of Q will divide Q exactly.And here 's the problem -- none of these primes on my list divide Q exactly.They 'll divide this number perfectly , butnot this plus 1 number.You 'll always have 1 left over.So the prime factors are not on this list.So this list is not complete.I said if there 's finitely many of them , I can have acomplete list.You can not .And that 's the proof that there areinfinitely many primes.So the definition of a prime is that it 's the buildingblocks of other numbers.So all other whole numbers are made bymultiplying primes together.So Q is a whole number , and it is made bymultiplying primes together.And in this case , the problem is none of the primes on mylist do that trick.They do n't divide the number exactly.So there 's primes missing.What I 've got here is a copy of a book called `` Euclid'sElements . '' And this is a textbook written by a Greekmathematician called Euclid.Now , Euclid lived in 300 BC.So this textbook is 2,300 years old.It 's never been out of print.And it 's second only to the Bible in that respect.It 's one of the most important books in mathematics.It 's one of the most important books in human history.And the proof that there are infinitely manyprimes is in here.And I checked it out earlier.It was on page 227 , which is Book Nine , Proposition 20.And it is right there , the proof that there areinfinitely many primes.There 's a couple of differences from this proof towhat I did.One difference is my proof there was something called aproof by contradiction.It 's something that mathematicians do a lot.It 's really useful.What Euclid did was slightly different.He assumed that there was a list of primes.And he said , but you can keep adding to it.So you can never complete the list , which is thesame sort of idea.The other difference is that this book was written in thedays before algebra.So he did n't have algebra to use like I did.So all his proofs are using straight lines and circles.So it looks quite different , but it 's actually quite easyto translate into modern terms.You see , mathematics is the search for truth.And this book is as true today as it was 2,300 years ago.We know a prime number can only be divided by 1 anditself , by no other factors , so how did Euclid define it ? It 's actually in here.I was quite excited when I found this.So let 's have a look.In Definitions -- look here -- at the beginning of BookSeven , he defines terms.Look at that . `` A prime number is that which is measured by a unit alone . `` So only units fit into the prime number.It was all measured with lines , so a line with length aprime can only fit units into it.You ca n't fit 2 's and 3 's and other lengths into it.So if we had something that was prime length -- let 's make it 7.There we go -- then you can fit 1 's into it -- 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7.But you would n't be able to fit 2 's into it.So here 's a 2.And that would not fit into my length 7.Or if I tried 4 's or 3 's , it would n't fit into my length 7.So a prime length would only fit units into it and itself.And that 's the definition of primes we have today.BRADY HARAN : So what does that mean for that new prime numberthat was found ? It 's just -- JAMES GRIME : It 's tiny.That new prime number , 17 million digits long ? Tiny.Nothing.Insignificant.To the whole infinity of prime numbers , it is small fry.BRADY HARAN : My understanding is that prime numbers becomeless frequent the higher you go.Their density becomes lower.Does that mean the next prime number is likely to be a longway away from those 17 million digits ? JAMES GRIME : They become more spaced out.You are right about that.And there 's -- we 're getting into other things here.But there are some fantastic theories , or theorems , abouthow the prime numbers are spaced out , the density ofprime numbers.But we are slipping into other realms there.BRADY HARAN : Sounds like another video.JAMES GRIME : It does sound like another video.It 'll be a good one , as well .
