Round 423,275 to the nearest thousand.So let me rewrite it : 423,275.And so the thousands place is the 3 right here , and so if wewere round it up to the nearest thousand , we would goto 420 -- let me write it so we just focus on the 3 -- we wouldgo up to 424,000 if we wanted to round up , 424,000 , and ifwe wanted to round down , we would go to 423,000.We would get rid of the 275.423,000.So this is our choice.Round up to 424,000 or round down to 423,000.And to figure it out , we just look at the digit one place tothe right of the 3 , so we look at the 2 right there.If that digit is 5 or greater , you round up.So this is 5.So if this is greater than or equal to 5 , 5 orgreater , you round up.If it 's less than 5 , you round down.2 is definitely less than 5 , so we just round down , so itis 423,000.Now just to visualize what this means to the nearestthousand , if I were to do a number line -- and you don'thave to do this.We 've gotten the answer , but just to have a little bitbetter visualization of it , if I were to increment bythousands , you might have 422,000 , 423,000.You have 424,000 , and then maybe over here , you have425,000 , and you could keep going.Now 423,275 is going to be someplace right around here.And so when we round to the nearest thousand , we have topick between that and that.We see that it much closer to 423,000 than to 424,000 , so weround it right there.But you just use the rules we just came up with , and werounded down to 423,000 .
