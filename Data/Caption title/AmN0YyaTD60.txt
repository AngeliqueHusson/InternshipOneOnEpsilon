Hexaflexagons -- they're cool , hip , and hexa-funto play with , right ? Wrong.Hexaflexagons are not toys.With the increasing number of hexaflexagons finding their wayinto homes and schools , it 's important to be awareof proper flexagation regulationswhen engaging in flexagon construction and use.Taking proper precautions can help avoid a flexa-catastrophe.Do not wear loose clothing when engaging in flexagation.If you have long hair , tie it back , so it does n't get caught in a flexagation device.Ties are also a common source of incidents.Stay alert.Never flexagate while under the influence.When using a hexaflexagon , sudden unexpected sidesmay appear , and drugs like alcohol can slow reaction time.If you are n't sure what kind of flexagon you 're dealing with , it 's safer to temporarily disable the flexagon.Flexagons can be disarmed by using scissorsto cut them apart.You can cut across the original seamwhere the paper strip was taped together , which may appear on the edge or through the faceof the flexagon.In an emergency , however , flexagonscan be cut apart right through a triangle , or on three edgesif you want to retain symmetry , or into nine separate trianglesif you really want to be safe.You can even cut them in half down the length of the paperstrip like this , into two separate -- Once you cut your flexagon apart , you can figure out what kind it is.If it has nine triangles , that 's 18 triangle sides.So at six triangles per hexagon side , that 's three sides of trihexaflexagon.Note that some flexagons might bemade from a double strip of triangles that have been foldedin half , so that marker does n't bleed through.Do n't let yourself be fooled by the extra triangles.Avoid danger during hexaflexagon construction.If you 're not working from a printed pattern , you might start your flexagon by picking a pointon the edge of a strip of paper , folding that 180 degreeangle into thirds to create 360 degree angles , and then using the equilateral triangle that resultsas a guide to fold the rest of the strip of paper , zigzagging back and forth.Without proper attention and focus , this could easily lead to becoming unreasonably amusedwith the springy spring of happy triangles that results.Always keep your hexaflexagon in good working order.Pre-creasing all the triangles both waysbefore configuring them into hexaflexagonal formationwill help your flexagon operate properly and avoid accidents.Keep a close watch on the chirality of your hexaflexagon.That is , whether it is right or left handed.Notice how in this hexaflexagon , water flowsclockwise down under the flaps , evenif you flip it over or flex it.Well , in this hexaflexagon , it flows counter-clockwise.They 're mirror images.The chirality is decided when you fold and tapeyour triangles into a twisty loop , and once taped , it is impossible to change from oneto the other without cutting it apart , at least in three-dimensional euclidean space.A change in chirality could be a signthat your flexagon has been flippedthrough four-dimensional space and is possibly a highlydangerous multi-dimensional portal.With experience , a hexaflexagon mastercan construct a hexaflexagon in mere seconds.Some forgo tape and scissors entirelyby folding a double strip that 's too longand tucking the extra in.This is an advanced technique that should notbe attempted without prior training.Beware topological changes.This family seems safe from this philosoraptor , because they live on separate planetswith a cold , empty vacuum of space between them.But after a single flex , the unfortunate victimsare now doomed , protected only by the inconsequential barrierof their domicile.Your stars might explode , your frowns may become smiles , your most pointy of triangles mightbecome the roundest of circles.Perfectly healthy snakes may turn into snake loops , or worse , become decapitated.Either state is fatal for the snake , as having no head can lead to starvation.This can be avoided by simply marking where connections willbe across neighboring triangles first.Afterwards , the lines can be filled in however you like.Be aware that with the trihexaflexagon , there are two variations to each face.So you can simply draw one side where triangles connect , and flip and draw the other.But in the hexa-hexaflexagon , the main threefaces each appear four different ways.If you use hexaflexagons , keep an eyeout for signs of dependency.Overuse can lead to addiction and possibly an overdose.Some users of hexaflexagons report confusion , mind-blown syndrome , hexaflexaperplexia , hexaflexadyslexia , hexaflexaperfectionism , and hexaflexa-Mexican-food-cravings.If you find yourself experiencingany of these symptoms , stop flexagon use immediately , and see the head of your math department.With proper precautions , flexagatingcan be a great part of your life.Follow these simple safety guidelines , and you should be ready for a fun and safe hexaflexagonexperience . test
