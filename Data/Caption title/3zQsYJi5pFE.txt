So in my last video I ranted about a taxi driver who almost hit me in the crosswalkbecause they couldn¡¯t brake fast enough in the rain , and I was thinking about thisproblem in a few ways.They couldn¡¯t stop before the crosswalk , but really it¡¯s that they couldn¡¯t decreasetheir speed fast enough to get from 50 to 0 before hitting the crosswalk , or maybe it¡¯sreally that the slope of their decreasing speed , out of all possible slopes , was nota steep enough slope.Too little deceleration.Now , some people after seeing my last video protested my use of the term deceleration.Deceleration : is it even a thing ? Or should we say¡­ negative accelleration ? Because the opposite of speeding up isn¡¯t slowing down , it¡¯s negative speeding-up.And that¡¯s the problem with cars ; they have separate modes for forward and reverse.When you¡¯re coming up to a stop light you do n't slow down by putting the car into reverse , you hit the brakes.And after you slow to a stop using the brakes , if you want to start going backwards backout of the crosswalk , it 's not like you do it by just holding down the brakes real hard.Deceleration stops when the speed of the car reaches zero , and negative accelleration startswhen you go into reverse , and when you brake while in reverse , slowing down your slowingdown , that¡¯s negative deceleration.Which is also known as acceleration.Yep , hitting the brakes while in reverse actually speeds you up , in the positive direction , because really we¡¯re talking about velocity not speed.Velocity : it¡¯s speed that cares.About direction.Care-Speed.BUT IF WE HAD HOVERCARS , there¡¯s no frictional attachment to the relative zero position ofthe earth , no friction-based brakes that care about things like whether you¡¯re stoppedor not.In a hover car , you¡¯d be zooming up to the crosswalk and instead of decellerating byhitting the brakes , because there are no brakes , you 'd hit the reverse thrusters that accellerateyou backwards , which would slow you down , I mean negatively care-speed you up to speedzero but instead of stopping , the hovercar would keep on the reverse thrusters and smoothlycontinue the deceleration curve until it were back out of the crosswalk.And possibly very far away so that I don¡¯t come after it on my hoverboard.Like , here 's the regular taxi : vroooom eeeeeee-shnk . mrhhhhshnk.And the hovercar : vvvvvv pffwhshhh.Clearly superior , and a much smoother ride.Good drivers avoid these sorts of nondifferentiable changes in accelleration ... y'know , the sudden-changeanglybits.Although in real life there¡¯s lots of little slope-iness going on everywhere in here ... Mm , slopes.I always found that weird , that you 'd get a smoother ride if you kept decelleratingin a hovercar until you 're going backwards , than if you just stop.Which is why to understand what it 's like to drive a hovercar I find it helpful to lookat the 2nd derivative , oh , did I mention care-speed is the 1st derivative of position over timeand accelleration is the 2nd ? Calculus.The art of lookin¡¯ at slopes.Side note : I 'm pretty sure the reason Newton gets the credit for inventing calculus insteadof Leibniz was that someone was like hey , newton , what are you doin ' , and he was like , I am integrating the derivatives of the differential calculus , and it sounded so fancy that theydecided kids just had to memorize all of it , while when someone asked Leibniz what he wasdoing , he was probably like , I 'm lookin ' at slopes , I like slopes.Do you like slopes ? I like slopes.Anyway that 's how it goes in my head.But it¡¯s the second derivative I care about , because when you¡¯re driving that¡¯s whatyou have control over.You can accelerate and decelerate using gas and brakes , that¡¯s it.Unless you¡¯ve got fancy cruise control that lets you directly input a speed , in whichcase you can sometimes work on a 1st-derivative level.And someday we¡¯ll all use self-driving cars where you just put in the position you wantto go and they calculate the rest , ah technology , lowering derivatives for the common good.Although if we were going to work directly with position rather than acceleration I¡¯dprefer straight up teleportation but if you like differentiable modes of transportationthen hovercars are the mathematically more beautiful choice of vehicle with which tonarrowly avoid hitting pedestrians , just look at that smooth flat deceleration that createsa constant sloping down-wards speed that goes right through the stillness of 0 to continuebackwards , which means your position over time as you approach the crosswalk and backaway again is the perfect smooth curve of a parabola.And whenever you buy a hovercar you should always check the range of your second derivativebecause more powerful thrusters means steeper slopes for your first derivative and tighterparabolas.Parabola ! It 's got all the slopes ! Look at the slopes ! It 's calculus ! ( lookin ' at slopes ) . test
