so in this video we 're going to find theinverse of a 2x2 matrix so let 's say wehave the matrix a and inside the matrixwe have the numbers a b c and d then theformula for the inverse of this matrix ais going to be equal to 1 over thedeterminant of matrix a this symbol thatlooks like the absolute value means thedeterminant of matrix a and this is allmultiplied by another matrix and in thismatrix notice these numbers in the reddiagonal notice how they switchpositions in the original matrix the awas in the top left position and nowit 's in the bottom right position andthe D in the original matrix was in thebottom right position and now in theinverse it 's in the top left position sothe numbers in the red diagonal have toswitch places and now we can take a lookat this green diagonal notice in thisgreen diagonal the C and the B theyactually stay in the same position asthe original matrix however in theinverse the signs switch in the originalmatrix they are positive notice and inthe inverse now they 're negative solet 's use this formula to find theinverse of a 2x2 matrix using realnumbers so here we have the 2x2 matrix Bwith the numbers 2 4 1 & 3 and the firstthing you want to do is find thedeterminant of this matrix B in order tofind the determinant of a 2 by 2 matrixthe only thing that you need to do ismultiply the red diagonal and thenmultiply the green diagonal and thensubtract them from each other so that'swhat I 'm going to do right now thedeterminant of matrix B is equal and thefirst thing I need to do is multiply thered diagonal notice how we have a 2 anda 3 so I 'm going to multiply 2 times 3and then we need to subtract andmultiply the green diagonal and noticein the green diagonal we have 4 times 1so I 'm going to multiply 4 times 1 sothe determinant of matrix B is equal to2 times 3 which is just sick- 4 times 1 which is 4 6 minus 4 isequal to 2 so we know from our formulabefore that the inverse of a was equalto 1 over the determinant of a so theinverse of matrix B is going to be equalto 1 over the determinant of matrix Band we know from before that thedeterminant of matrix B is equal to 2 soI 'm going to replace the determinantsymbol with the number 2 and now theonly thing that we need to do is fill inthe inside of our 2x2 matrix so firstlet 's take a look at the red diagonal weneed to switch the positions of thosenumbers so in the original matrix B thered diagonal has a 2 and a 3 notice howthe 2 is in the top-left cornerso in the inverse is going to be in thebottom right corner and notice how thenumber 3 is in the bottom right cornerof the original matrix B so in theinverse is going to be in the top-leftcornerso now let 's take a look at the greensagonal we have a 1 and a 4 they actuallystay in the same position in the inverseas they are in the original matrix B soI 'm going to keep them in the sameposition however they switch sides sincethey 're both positive in the originalmatrix they 're both going to be negativein the inverse matrix so now we havetaken the inverse of matrix B howeverthis 1 over 2 is a scalar and can bemultiplied by all the numbers so I needto simplify this matrix a little bitfurther the inverse a matrix B is equalto 1 over 2 times 3 which is 3 over 2 1over 2 times negative 4 is just negative2 1 over 2 times negative 1 is negative1/2 and 1 over 2 times 2 is justpositive 1 so this is our final answernow we have found the inverse of matrixB test
