Unbeknownst to many , there are two ways of tying your shoelace . You see , the first step is usually like this.In the second step , you caneitherdo it like this , in which case , you see , the knot becomes kind of perpendicular to the direction of the lace at the end.Or , you can do exactly the mirror image of what you have just done.And it is slightly wrong , actually , when you do this.But that 's a nice way to do it.When you do that , in this case , the knot becomes kind of parallel , if you see what I mean , to the shoelace.What did I do ? So , there are two ways of doing it , right ? You can do , start from , like , this , or the other direction . So let 's do it in this direction , in some sense.Now , that determines one of the orientations.So , one way to do it is to , from my point of view , the right hand , and pull it over , and then do this , which produces aperpendicular knot.The other way isto make the loop with myleft hand , and then turn it over and through , and then make the knot , in which casethe knot becomes parallel to the shoelace . That 's quite interesting . Now , it turns out that these two things have a difference.And I 'd like to show one of the differences . Which is also a nice trick to know in practice , in daily life . Let 's make a knotby first doing this , and then , secondly , by doing that . If you think of this as a mirror , this is notsymmetric with respect to this mirror . Because you see , this strand goes under this loop , whereas this one goes over this loop.It 's kind of more like a , you know , rotation symmetry . Whereas if I put them in this configuration , that 's symmetric , in the sense that they 're both going under.And you can see that it is symmetric . Now , Brady : `` So which one matches which shoelace ? `` I think this one matches the parallel one , and the rotation one matches the perpendicular one.I 'm not entirely sure about this . You explore . Okay.So , let 's make a tight knot with this . And this is a fairly tight knot . This was the symmetric one.And , you know , if you wanted to undo this knot , you have to go in , and it 's really a bothersome.But there is actually a nice trick to undo this knot.Let me show it to you first . I hold it like this . It comes straight off.What did I do ? Let 's do it in slow motion and in detail . Again , this is the symmetric one . And when Iclose it , it 's like that.You grab those two or those two . It does n't matter which one , let 's . And when you pull them taut , you get the straight line.And it turns out that the knot , the entire knot , can slide across the , along the straight line.And it just comes off the endand undoes itself.So this kind of symmetric knot is quite fragile.Or , if you like , if you knotted it like this , as far as it 's somewhere in the middle , it 's quite tight , and it 's , it 's secure . But if you want to untie it , you do n't have to go in and mess around with just undoing that , I need to , a little bit.You can pull it off , slide it off completely . Whereas , if you made the otherrotational knot , which one is it ? It 's I think this one.Brady : `` This is a the asymmetric . `` Asymmetric one . And this one goes over , this one goes under . It 's not symmetric with respect to the similar.That 's a very secure knot . You ca n't really undo it . The only way to undo it is to actually go in.So it 's useful to know , by the way.You know , what is this thing ? It certainly has a lot of crossings . But againwe 're looking for the minimal number of crossings , so we try to untangle this and open it up as much as we possibly can.And if you 're patient enough and do that test
