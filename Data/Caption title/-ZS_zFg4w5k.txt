at the turn of the 20th centuryalongside thinking about themechanization of physical work peoplebegan to ponder the mechanization ofmental work one way to think aboutmental works or mental labor is theprocess of thinking that unfolds whenmaking difficult decisions which leadsone to some state of belief aboutsomething and at the time peoplewondered a complex decision making couldbe mechanized and only in recent yearsas anyone allowed their judgment so tospeak with regard to making decisions bemade by a computer instead of by humanbeingsfor example IBM the counting machineswould perform a series of calculationsand store the intermediate resultsallowing it to build on previous resultsto arrive at final answers in about twoweeks during which we had maybe a dozenhours of actual calculation we did workthat would have taken a man with a deskcatheter a hundred years and immediatelypeople wanted flexibility in terms ofwhat these machines did so the abilityto change the sequence of operationsbecame important at first this was donewith plug boards allowing one toreprogram the machines operationphysically and people began thinkingabout how far we could take this processembedding a sequence of mathematical andlogical operations into a mechanism sothat I can think for us Hilbert wasfamous to challenging the academiccommunity to think about the possibilityof the mechanical process that isautomatic machines which could answerquestions for example one of hischallenges was a machine which couldanswer yes or no as to whether a givenstatement about mathematics is true insuch a mechanical process existing itwould completely automate the work ofall mathematiciansand at the time calculation machineswere well-known of course but thinkingmachines were not and so the mechanismsof these decision machines were n't yetdefined people were still speculated andthis is where Alan Turing enters thestory since childhood he was fascinatedwith the complex mechanisms behind thehuman mindTuring simplified everyone 's conceptionsof what physical form these decisionmachines would actually take and in 1928he published a historic paper thatdirectly addressed Hilbert 's challengesin it he imagines a machine that can doanything any other machine might doknown as a universal machine and hebegins by imagining a machine as a humanin a box with a pencil and a stack ofpaper and they are handed a book ofinstructions to follow so in order tochange what this human does you mustalter the instructions in the bookthat 's the deep inside he had definingbehavior with symbols instead ofmechanisms this was a very clever trickat the time so he spends the first 60 % of his paper laying out precisely how itwould work and what form these writteninstructions or algorithms would take asfollowsthink of each page in this book ofinstructions as a single decision firstcomes an observation which is the IFShalf of the conditional statement andwhat the person is observing isprecisely where their pencil is pointingin the rough work in our example it'sthe first symbol of the input he callsthis their awareness so they are onlyever aware of one symbolnext they look at their instructions andcompare the symbol in their memory to alist of possibilities in the firstcolumn to find a match once a match isfound they move on to the second step ofthe conditional statement the operationstep and what they do here isinterestingtouring observes that no matter what theinstructions are or what language theyare in they are only ever going to bewriting down symbols on the paper and ormoving their attention to some newlocation and so the last column in thetable callednext state lists the next page to jumpto in this book analogy each page in thebook is a new step touring calls thesesteps states of the machine and when thenext state is arrived at their currentawareness where their pencil iscurrently pointing is observed again andthen they scan to find a match in thesame way once they do they follow thesequence and then jump to the next stateand this process continues state afterstate and so the process of computationis exactly like turning pages in a bookand at each page making a decision aboutwhat to do next based on where thepencil is pointing on a separate pageand note that this book would n't be readin the same linear order it 's more likea choose-your-own-adventure at each pagebecause the sequence in which they flowthrough the pages or States will dependon the input they receive but eventuallythis process leads to a final statewhere they write down an answer and Hulkor stuck and they output their resultand that 's how it worksnotice the decision-making power of thismachine is stripped away from the humanall of the logic of their behavior isbased on how the book or algorithm isdesigned what we call the program andtouring notes that all of these stepscould be done with pre-existingtechnology we do n't need a human asfollowsor reading symbols off the paper touringimagines a certain scanner tag which canmove around and read individual symbolsone at a time into some form of memoryknown as a read operation and then itwould move to the current state andidentify when a value in the firstcolumn matches the scanned symbol andonce a match is found it moves over tothe operation step and lastly it alsocontains a printer so it can outputsymbols given by the instructions knownas print operation and that 's all itdoesfree move script over and over and overagain and to further simplify thistouring reminds us that the book youprovide or the algorithm and the rufflescould all be done on one big piece ofpaper and that paper could be arrangedin a long array instead of a 2d sheetleading to his famous complication of amachine which is essentially a roll ofpaint and a scanner printer head and anysymbolic process performed by a moderncomputer can be performed by this simplemachines Turing states that anything hisUniversal machine can write down is whatwe call computable so a computableproblem is a problem that a Turingmachine could be programmed to solvegiven enough time and space to do it acomputer as we know today is a devicewhich can accept information in someform store it process it and produceanswers in an acceptable read ofreadable form with this definition ofcourse goes the injunction if we'regoing to call it a computer that it mustbe able also to stores on instructionsand process them from within the machineand so touring shows that all the powerof machines are the feature computerswould be based on how you design theinstruction table instead of needing anycomplex mechanism inside the machineitself he then turns to the largerquestions in the second half of thispaper what can or ca n't be written downby an automatic mechanism is thereanything that ca n't be computed what isuncomputable [ Music ] test
