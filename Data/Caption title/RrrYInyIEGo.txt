hello professor v welcome u seen set real visualize number linea line object number line represent real point space every real number correspond single point space vice previous lecture dis cussed operation c artesian product lecture see c artesian us construct mathematical correspond point two saw last lecture c artesian product two set bis formed one element set form ordered collection ordered pair formed c artesian product form new set contain ordered pair represent ing every possible combination first element set second element set b c artesian product written symbol look like multiplication symbol display ordered pair c artesian product grid form simple system specify ing colors element locate horizontal vertical position within grid necessary operand c artesian product different set instance form c artesian product set written c artesian product squared locate horizontal vertical position within grid specify ing colors element instead set contain ing colored square set could locate position grid specify ing numerical value first second element ordered pair set finite set also create c artesian product infinite instance set could set integer z forming c artesian product set integer infinite set ordered pair element every possible combination two course would need infinitely large grid represent ordered pair writing every ordered pair ordered pair position pair corresponding unique point locate position point pair number ordered pair first element correspond position horizontal number line second element correspond position vertical number line point formed c artesian product set integer form infinite grid point spaced one unit apart instead set integer z form c artesian product set real r create continuum point completely fill every ordered pair two real unique point space system ordered pair real point sis cal led c artesian system element ordered pair correspond point cal led point led system ne book la algebra geometry single subject analytic geometry describe geometric algebraic algebraic equation visualize geometric possible soon see algebraic equation define set vie wed c artesian system appear perpendicular number c artesian system refer red axes horizontal vertical axes often cal led x axis two axes refer red abscissa ordinate point axes meet represent number zero axis cal led origin system origin correspond ordered pair infinite plane contain ing x axes refer red c artesian plane axes divide four region cal led first fourth starting upper right quadrant counterclockwise quadrant usually mathematician prefer draw number arrow pointing towards positive direction direction increasing value seen number line correspond set real r forming c artesian product set real number equivalent forming c artesian product number line form c artesian plane number line consist continuum space point correspond unique real number c artesian plane consist continuum point siding space point correspond unique ordered pair real c artesian system graphically display set ordered pair group point space later see algebraic equation describe infinite set vie wed system appear two dimension sin next lecture see c artesian system allow us visualize set ordered triple three dimension algebra c artesian system algebra c artesian system algebra c artesian system algebra c artesian system algebra c artesian system algebra c artesian system algebra c artesian system algebra c artesian system algebra c artesian system algebra c artesian system algebra c artesian system algebra c artesian system
