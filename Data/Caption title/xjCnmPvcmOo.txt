We 're asked to simplify d times 4d to the 1/2 power.So let 's see what we can do here.And I think there 's multiple ways to kind of simplify it , and we 'll explore all of them.So d times 4d to the 1/2.4d to the 1/2 , let me just focus on that right there.4d to the 1/2.If you take the product of two things and you raise that toan exponent , that 's the same thing as taking each of thoseterms to that exponent and then taking the product.So 4d to the 1/2 is the same thing as 4 to the 1/2 times dto the 1/2.And of course , you have this d out front.And I could put the parentheses here , but itdoes n't matter at this point.Now you just have three things that you'retaking the product of.So I 'll put this d out front just like that.And now there 's a couple of ways you could think about it.You have this 4 to the 1/2 power and you 're taking itsprincipal square root , so its positive square root.So that right there is going to be 2.So 4 to the 1/2 , that right there is goingto be equal to 2.And then , there 's a couple of ways you could think about it.You have this d out front.And then you have a d to the 1/2.And there 's several ways that you can now represent this , depending on what you feel -- I do n't know -- aesthetically pleasant.You could say , well look , this is d to the first power.This is d to the 1/2 power.I could add them.So one way to say it is it 's 2 times d to the 1 plus 1/2.You can either say 1 and 1/2 power or 3/2power if you want.So that 's one simplification of this expression.Another simplification would be well , you could say , look.d to the 1/2 , that is the same thing as the square root of d.So you could say this is the same thing as 2 times d timesthe square root of d.So any of these are actual simplifications , but it'sinteresting to see that they 're really allrepresenting the same thing . test
