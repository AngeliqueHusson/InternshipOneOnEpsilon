find the circumference of the circlethat has a radius of 12 inches so if Iwere to draw the circle right over herethe radius so that 's the center of thecircle the radius here is 12 inches weneed to figure out how what 's thedistance to go around the circle thedistance of the if if I were to make astring here and go actually around justlike this so the first thing to realizeis that there 's a very special numbercalled pi that we use when we deal withcircles and pi is actually defined asthe ratio between the circumference andthe diameter of a circle this is one ofthe ways that one can define pi and piis denoted by the Greek letter pi andthis is and we can keep adding digits toit but it 's 3.14159 and some people makesport out of trying to memorize as manydigits of pi as possible but it 's one ofthose weird wacky numbers that show upthroughout nature and it just keeps onrepeating for actually it keeps themgoing on forever but it does not repeatwhich is crazy I mean maybe you knowthere why was n't the ratio of thecircumference of the diameter of circlesthree it 's just this you know insteadit 's this kind of wacky wacky wackynumber but with that out of the waythrough this definition of what pi is weactually get a formula for if you knowpi and if you know one of these twothings you can get the other one so ifyou will know the diameter and you wantto come out of the circumference youmultiply both sides of this really thisdefinition of pi you multiply both sidesby D and you get C is equal to pi timesD or another way to think about itbecause the diameter of a circle is tworadii the length of a diameters twotimes the length of the radius you canreplace your diameter with two times theradius and so that gives you and this iskind of a famous formula C is equal toor circumference is equal to two pi twopi R or here it 's pi times two times ouryou switch them around you get two pi Rand we just apply that our radius istwelve inches so this is going to be 12we need to calculate the circumferenceour circumference is going to be twotimes pi times 12 that is 24 timespi if we want the exact number rememberpi is an actual number it 's 3.14159keeps on going on and on forever let'sactually get our calculator out so wecan multiply we can multiply 24 and thenwe have to find pi here pi is right inyellow there so I press second and thatright over there 24 pi which literallyjust means 24 times the number pi whichis 24 times 3.14159 on and on and on andwe get 75 point three nine eight sodepending they have n't told us exactlyexactly how much precision they wantover here but if we round to the nearestactually even if we round to thehundredths place we get seventy fivepoint four oh so I 'll go with that sothis is equal to approximately equal toseventy five point four oh and we'redone test
