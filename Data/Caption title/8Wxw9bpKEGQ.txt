Divide x squared minus 3x plus 2 divided by x minus 2.So we 're going to divide this into that.And we can do this really the same way that you firstlearned long division.So we have x minus 2 being dividedinto x squared minus 3x plus 2.Another way we could have writtenthe same exact expression is x squared minus 3x plus 2 , all of that over x minus 2.That , that , and that are all equivalent expressions.Now , to do this type of long division -- we can call it algebraic long division -- you want to look at the highest degree term on the x minus 2and the highest degree term on the x squared minus 3x plus 2.And here 's the x , and here 's the x squared.x goes into x squared how many times ? Or x squared divided by x is what ? Well , that 's just equal to x.So x goes into x squared x times.And I 'm going to write it in this column righthere above all of the x terms.And then we want to multiply x times x minus 2.That gives us -- x times x is x squared.x times negative 2 is negative 2x.And just like you first learned in long division , you want to subtract this from that.But that 's completely the same as adding the opposite , or multiplying each of these terms by negative 1and then adding.So let 's multiply that times negative 1.And negative 2x times negative 1 is positive 2x.And now let 's add.x squared minus x squared -- those cancel out.Negative 3x plus 2x -- that is negative x.And then we can bring down this 2 over here.So it 's negative x plus 2 left over , when we only go x times.So then we say , can x minus 2 go into negative x plus 2 ? Well , x goes into negative x negative one times.You can look at it right here.Negative x divided by x is negative 1.These guys cancel out.Those guys cancel out.So negative 1 times x minus 2 -- you have negative 1times x , which is negative x.Negative 1 times negative 2 is positive 2.And we want to subtract this from that , just like you do in long division.But that 's the same thing as adding the opposite , or multiplying each of these terms by negative 1and then adding.So negative x times negative 1 is positive x.Positive 2 times negative 1 is negative 2.These guys cancel out , add up to 0.These guys add up to 0.We have no remainder.So we got this as being equal to x minus 1.And we can verify it.If we multiply x minus 1 times x minus 2 , we should get this.So let 's actually do that.So let 's multiply x minus 1 times x minus 2.So let 's multiply negative 2 times negative 1.That gives us positive 2.Negative 2 times x -- that 's negative 2x.Let 's multiply x times negative 1.That is negative x.And then x times x is x squared.And then add all the like terms.x squared , negative 2x minus x -- that 's negative 3x.And then 2 plus nothing is just 2.And so we got that polynomial again .
