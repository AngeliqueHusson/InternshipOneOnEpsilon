welcome video ellipses start example want basic thing know start homework problem wrote two different ellipse equation one left right notice plus sign middle equation see equation look like dont see plus sign ellipse theres negative sign middle going hyperbola make sure look whenever homework example another thing want go notice squared term left side thats necessarily time squared term actually biggest number squared term b squared term theyre denominator whatever bigger number squared whatever smaller number b squared basic thing want start example said right away problem minus squared plus x minus squared equal notice plus sign middle equation know ellipse first thing going going find center ellipse right going find center center usually written form h k h x center k center h term always next x notice next number x always opposite sign since negative next x h term going positive k term actually number thats next term since next negative going number always sign always opposite center ellipse center one plot graph going go right two one two going one unit center ellipse point two one right plotted center need find vertices next thing going going find vertices right talking squared b denominator helpful telling us vertices first thing going going find term like said squared always bigger number denominator number denominator left number number denominator right bigger number going squared right order find take square root squared equal square root number helpful finding vertices distance center ellipse vertices distance distance center vertices let go center dont know direction goes vertices right vertices dont know going explain know direction vertices like find direction need go look squared term term x value notice x numerator squared term x value since squared term x value know vert ice going x direction x direction goes parallel x axis mean goes right left right know vertices going x direction theres one vert ice make big dot also another left university going erase dot wrote middle weve plotted actually actually find actual vertices vertices left goes right goes one unit know point six one left goes left one two goes one unit know point negative positive alright let plot two vertices use b squared term help b squared term going tobe smaller number denominator number know since b squared equal b found taking square root b equal square root equal since b squared term notice b squared value know b going go direction b center direction let go center direction going go gon na go plotted vertices direction plot find come vertices bottom go one two go one two point positive negative vert ice top go go point positive positive right weve plotted vertices make rough sketch ellipse usually look really bad artist though apologize try right ellipse last thing need need plot foci right thing use find distance center foci c squared formula find c squared value c squared going equal minus b squared trouble formula like think c squared equal bigger number squared minus smaller number squared big number squared minus b squared b squared smaller number denominator c squared value equal minus equal c equal find value c taking square root c equal square root square root somewhere square root square root little bit closer value would say little bit less right plot point c distance center ellipse foci right direction need go always direction direction longer axis ellipse tell longer axis ellipse one going x direction much longer one going direction know c value going go x direction since longer since longer direction square root seven little bit less three going go right center little bit less three one two three ill go little bit left little little bitless three also going go left little bit less three one two three little bitless plotted foci alright exact value since need write exact know center distance know foci square root seven right gon na add square root seven one goes one unit foci left know center ellipse foci square root left center subtract square root one unit hope video gave better idea ellipse graph important point video hyperbola well havent already made stay tuned next video see later ellipses conic section ellipses conic section ellipses conic section ellipses conic section ellipses conic section ellipses conic section ellipses conic section ellipses conic section ellipses conic section ellipses conic section ellipses conic section ellipses conic section ellipses conic section ellipses conic section ellipses conic section ellipses conic section ellipses conic section ellipses conic section ellipses conic section ellipses conic section ellipses conic section ellipses conic section ellipses conic section ellipses conic section ellipses conic section
