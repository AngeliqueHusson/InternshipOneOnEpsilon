hi p resh geometry textbook following problem right triangle hypotenuse equal altitude hypotenuse equal area triangle figure story goes teacher ask problem class every single student quick submit ted calculation teacher said none calculation correct figure give problem try ready keep watching video solution going approach problem drawing diagram right triangle hypotenuse altitude hypotenuse equal area triangle equal base times height divided apply formula might help rotate triangle hypotenuse becomes base altitude becomes height substituting formula get area equal correct answer problem reason dimension problem correct let see imagine hypotenuse equal two end point line segment make two point triangle want know draw third point third vertex make right triangle every point make right triangle point form right triangle want figure locus point place third vertex make right triangle figure third vertex form angle going subtend arc think hypotenuse diameter circle third vertex anywhere else circle form right triangle point form right triangle hypotenuse altitude hypotenuse vertical distance third point hypotenuse vary depending point circle want know altitude make well move altitude way point possible altitude right triangle exactly equal radius one half diameter mean altitude could equal correct answer problem typo textbook right triangle hypotenuse equal altitude hypotenuse equal altitude equal half hypotenuse would figure thanks watching video please subscribe channel make video math catch follow face book go ogle catch social media video please check links video description evil geometry problem evil geometry problem evil geometry problem evil geometry problem evil geometry problem evil geometry problem evil geometry problem evil geometry problem evil geometry problem evil geometry problem evil geometry problem
