before we discuss what exactly is thelargest number we need to set a fewconditions in place so that things don'tgo crazy okaycondition number one the largest numbermust be useful in some way even if ithas a very very very very tiny amount ofviews ' that would be fine as long asthere is some use to such number secondof all the number must not be arbitraryfor example 1 million and how did youget to that 1 million I know you said itbut how did you get to that 1 million sothe number must not be arbitrary thirdof all you ca n't say the largest numberanyone could think of plus one that isnot allowed and that 's cheating okayfourth of all and most important of allknow infinity the number must be finitenow that last point I 'd like to stay onfor it because infinity is a veryinteresting concept it paves much moredifferently than your normal numbers toexplain how that is let me give yousomething called Hilbert 's paradox ofthe Grand Hotel let 's say that you arethe manager of a hotel with an infinitenumber of rooms and your hotel is fullybooked there 's an infinite number ofguests let 's say that someone shows upand would like to check in in your hotelhow do you solve this problem do youtell them that it 's fully booked wellyou do n't have to because your hotel isvery special how do you solve thisproblemyou tell the guests in room number 1 tomove to room number 2 and you tell theguests in room number 2 to move to roomnumber 3 and you tell the guests in roomnumber 3 to move the room number 4 theywill keep doing this throughout theentirety of the hotel and now you haveroom number 1 empty and you can tell thethe guests to check in that that meansinfinity is equals to infinity plus 1yeah very weird but it gets weirderlet 's say that an infinite number ofguests show up and would like to checkin in your hotel do you tell them thatit 's fully booked now again your hotelis very special how do you solve thisproblemthe guest in room number one to move toroom number two and you tell the guestsin room number two to move to roomnumber four and you tell the guest inroom number three to move to room numbersix and then you tell the guests in roomnumber four to move to room number eightand you keep doing this throughout theentirety of the hotel and now you havean infinite number of rooms and you canaccommodate an infinite number of gueststhat mean that means infinity plusinfinity equals infinity you see theproblems with infinity good we can moveon so with that said let 's try and findthe largest number first we need anarbitrary number I know I 've said thatthe largest number can not be anarbitrary number but this is only acomparison point we 're going to try andfind useful numbers and see whether theyare larger than the arbitrary numberclear good so let 's pick a goggle agoggle is our comparison point a Goganis ten to the power of a hundred or itis one with a hundred zeros next to itokay so is the number of atoms in yourbody larger than a Gogan the number ofatoms in your body are around sevenoctillion so no it is not larger than ago Google is it the number of atoms inearth that would be about 133 onedecision and no again not larger than agogit how about the number of atoms inthe observable universe that would beabout a hundred quadrillion regiontrillion nope still not bigger than agoogol this is the number of atoms inthe observable universe and we can'teven be a Google however there are otherareas of mathematics that could beuseful that could be ita goggle one way is through this crazyRubik 's Cube over here which has thismany ways to arrange that is a numberthat is larger than a googol so we beaton Google can we beat a number evenbigger than Google can we beatgoogolplex which is 10 to the power of agoogol can we do that let 's see howabout the number of different possibleuniverses calculated by and where theyended up with 10 to the power of 10 tothe power of 16 nope not larger than agoogolplex how about once they assumethat if we were not limited as observersto distinguish more universes how aboutthat number that number is 10 to thepower of 10 to the power of 10 to thepower of 7 and that number is largerthan a googolplex so let 's pick our nextarbitrary number how about a Googleelection which is 10 to the power of agoogolplex can we find a useful numberlarger than it now beyond this point Iwill not get into too much detail aboutwhy the number that I will mention areuseful all you have to know is thatthere is some usefulness to them ifyou 'd like to know why I 've put links inthe description anyway with that destroyand meet a Google election which is 10to the power of you go with Lex so howabout this guy 's numbers here there wasone that was 10 to the power of 10 tothe power of 10 to the power of 34 so noit does n't beat a googolplex Ian butthen there was 10 to the power of 10 tothe power of 10 to the power of 963 sowe built a Google black Chien beyondthis point I 'm not gon na mention anyarbitrary comparison points like aGoogle Google Plus or Google pledgingbecause the numbers that I will mentionuseful numbers still useful numbers areso big so large so ridiculously hugethat you ca n't even write them downthat 's how big they are about to get sowith that said we have next up Williamsand number so what exactly is Graham'snumber Wayne 's number is the upper boundto a certain solution in somethingcalled Ramseyfear we this bound is between 11 andgrams number the solution to thisproblem falls in that range as I saidI 'm not going to get in too technicalabout why this number is useful you ifyou want to understand it link is in thedescription Reims number is so big it isdifficult to explain in what with usingnormal mathematical notation so we needto learn a new form of mathematicalnotation called knots up our ownnotation in order to express howridiculously big Graham 's number reallyis so what exactly is not up ournotation let 's begin with a 3/3 okay andput an up arrow that 's not up ournotation and another three you will findout that this is very simple this is 3to the power of 3 the answer to that 27nothing too complicated about it so farso far let 's now put two arrows threearrow arrow three that would be threearrow three arrow 3 that 's 3 to thepower of 3 to the power of 3 and theresult of that something like sevenpoint six trillion as you can see thatwe went from 27 to seven point sixtrillion with only adding one additionalarrow but things after this point getsstart to get a bit crazy so let 's takethree now and put three arrows betweenit and another three that 's three arrowarrow arrow three cool now this meansthis is three arrow arrow three arrowarrow three that 's three arrow arrowseven point six trillion this means thisis three ^ 3 ^ 3 ^ 3 ^ 3 ^ 3 ^ 3 ^ 3 andyou keep saying this seven point sixtrillion times do you see how the numberjust exploded from just having one arrowto 3 in order to find Graham 's numberyou have to begin with three arrow arrowarrow arrow three that 's four arrows sothree arrow arrow arrowthree we already know that three arrowarrow arrow three with three arrows isan unbelievably large number so you cansee that the number that you 'll get fromhaving four arrows this is the reactionthat you would have to it speechlesswhat Graham 's number is is even muchmuch larger than that okay so what youneed to do is you need to take theresult of three four arrows three andyou call that G one I would suggest youwould sit on a toilet right now becausethings are about to get insane not justcrazy so what happens next what happensnextyou take G 1 which is the result ofthree arrow arrow arrow three fourarrows of three and then call that G oneright down another three are you sittingdown and you put next to it ad onenumber of arrows and once you finish youwrite down another three b-big really beyou 're not done you 're not done youstill have to progress a bit more thenwhat you need to do is take the resultof that and you call it G - cool youtake G - again you write a 3 and then aG - number of arrows between it anotherthree okay you take the result of thatand you call it G 3 take G 3 write downthe three G 3 number of arrows three youtake the result of that call it G 4 andso on and so forth - keep going untilyou end up with G 64 and G 64 isGraham 's number you can see how just biggrapes number really is it'sridiculously big really really reallybig and what 's surprising about this isthat there are even larger usefulnumbers then Graham 's number now beyondthis point beyond this point I have toconfess here my understanding of thosenumbers of numbers larger than Graham'snumber starts to collapse I do n't getthem I do n't understand them so I willhave to trust my friends our friends atGoogle adji wewhich is a wiki dedicated entirely tovery very big numbers and yeah so let'sgo into that be prepared for it bepreparedlet 's go one of those numbers is threethree three three is so big so massivethen I feel like I 'm going to suffocatefrom how big three three really is youknow at least with Wang 's number wecould visualize how we got to beresolved through knots up our notationbut not our own notation is not enoughto express how large three three reallyis there is something called chainedarrow notation which is like knots ofour own notation but on crack you couldget a number that 's close to Graham'snumber using this notation throughwriting this down this is a number closeto Graham 's number but even change ournotation three three would laugh at itthree three is that what it is that bignow I tried I tried to find a simpleexplanation of three three and as I'vesaid before it is in unbelievablydifficult to comprehend numbers afterGraham 's number three three is a largeI 've looked up I really looked up peoplethat write that try to explain whatthree three really is in in laymen termsbut I 'm convinced I 'm really convincedthat it is impossible to really explainwhat three three really is it 's anunbelievable number and what 's reallyunbelievable is that there is a numbereven larger and then three three andthis is where we arrive at loadersnumber loaders number is big its largeit 's stupidly large its horrendously bigit is much larger than three three it ismuch much larger than Graham 's numberyou see at this point all I have for youto give you some sense of how bignumbers are at this point is just toexplain it to you through words youca n't even imagine the process forgetting thenumbers at least I could tell you howloaders number came to be it was theresult of a contest that was held thecondition was to write AC program in 512characters or less that will generatethe largest possible output the winnerof which is a guy called Ralph loaderhence why it 's called loaders number buteven then there 's a larger number thanthere and this is where we arrived attry use number rise number is biggerthan anything else I 've mentioned so farit is very very very large that 's howbig it really is so how did why usenumber came to be well there was thiscontest and MIT contest that pitted twopeople against each other and amalga andAugustin arrived there was even a posterfor the competition now the point ofthis competition was to find the largestnumber possible but according to certainrules first you could not use primitivesemantic vocabulary for example youcould n't say the smallest number biggerthan any number named by a human so farthat is not allowed you also had toexplain any sort of unusual notation tothe audience for example I explained toyou earlier something called knots upour own notation which is probablysomething that is new to you so if theyused any kind of new notation they hadto explain it to the audience they alsohad to fit this expression that wouldname the largest number in aregular-sized chalkboard and finally noinfinity so as you can see the rules arekind of similar to what I mentionedearlier in the video now that we knowthe rules this is what happened duringthe competition why you went first heapproached the board and he wrote onenot the largest number I was just tryingto start okayeh and then Elgar came in and heretaliated by writing nein nein neinnein nein nein nein so on and so forththen Rio countered by writing 1 1 1 1 11 1 he actually got a large numberbecause one takes less space than anight so you could write more of them onthe board and then Elgar came back witha brilliant idea instead of the ones hestarted putting exclamation marks allthe way until he was left with only 2ones so now you had an 11 with a lot ofexclamation marks next to itnow of course exclamation marks indicatethat this is a factorial operation sothe number that you get at the end of itis is pretty bigthings started to get complicatedafterwards and weird notation started toget used until Ryu won how with thefollowing expression the smallest numberbigger than any finite number named byan expression in the language of settheory with the Google symbols or lessnow that is not the final expression ifyou would like to find the finalexpression I will suggest you read anarticle written by I am self link is inthe description where he takes thatexpression and dissect it down to whatgives birth to ryos number now you mighthave this thought swimming about thatsays hold on a minutedid n't you mention in the beginning ofthe video that the largest number mustbe useful in some way it must not bearbitrary ryos number came as a resultof a contest that wanted to find thelargest number how is it useful and howis it not arbitrary to that here is myargument you can be convinced by it andyou can not be convinced by it it 's up toyou at the end of the day now thatcontest was actually an exercise to showhow our philosophy and mathematicsactually intersect with one another sothere 's your usefulness right there andwhen it comes to be to it not beingarbitrary you have to remember that thecontestants they had to work withconditions in order to findlargest number so in this case thenumber is in exactly arbitrary and it isuseful however this is at the end of theday my target at the same time they alsowanted people to be entertained in thatcontest and to take them so there 's moreusefulness for you right there I don'tknow it 's up to you it 's up to you atthe end of the day I did n't want toactually point that out for youaugustin Ryu you know the guy that cameup with rice number is actually mainly aphilosopher not a mathematician okay soit is very interesting how a guy that'sinvolved in philosophy actually came upwith a number that is so big so largelike or I use number okay now I alsohave to point that that in an interviewor are you mentioned that after thecontest he wanted people to get out andhave this idea in their head that howcan I come up with a number that islarger then ryos number and you probablycan still do that go ahead read thearticle that Ryu has written and if youcan understand how always come how do Iuse number came to be try and come upwith a number that is larger than ryosnumber but for now Ryu 's number is thelargest number and with that that hasbeen my take on what exactly is thelargest number thank you very much test
