okay so welcome to my video on binomialdistribution and it 's really importantto know that this method of probabilityis only possible if there is twooutcomes so what do I mean by this aneasy example would be flipping a coinfive times when you flip a coin there'sonly two possible outcomes it 's eithergoing to be heads or it 's going to betailsso it is possible to use the binomialdistribution to to solve the probabilityof how many of those five coin tossesare heads and how many are tails and I'mgoing to talk about this a little bitmore in this example just remember thatthis method is only possible when thereare two outcomes so let 's get startedright away with this example okay inthis example it says a student guesseson all five questions of amultiple-choice quiz each question hasfour possible answers and it 's asking uswhat is the probability that the studentgot exactly 4 questions correct now it'simportant to recognize that there 's onlytwo possible outcomes for this problemone of the outcomes is that the studentis going to get the question correct andthe other outcome is that the student isnot going to get the question correct sosince there 's two possible outcomes wecan solve this this problem usingbinomial distribution okay so let'swrite down everything that we know inthe first line it says a student guesseson all five questions of the quiz so thetotal number of guesses or the totalnumber of trials which we 're going towrite with the letter n we know that thetotal number of trials is equal to fiveokay and this question is asking us whatis the probability that the student gotexactly four questions correct so out ofthe five total guesses he 's going tosucceed four times he 's going to getfour questions correct so so the numberof times he succeeds which is the letterKis equal to four so we know if there'sfive total questions on the quiz and thestudent got four correct that means thathe must have got one incorrect and wecan write the number that he gotincorrect or the failures with theletters n minus K the total number nwhich is 5 minus the number right K forfive minus four is equal to one so nowlet 's talk about the probability ofsuccess or you could say the probabilitythat a student gets a question correctit says in the problem that eachquestion has four possible answers andonly one out of those four answers isthe correct answerso if the student guesses there 's only aone in four chance that he got thequestion correct so so the probabilityof success is equal to one and four oryou could say twenty-five percent so weknow that both probabilities theprobability of success and theprobability of failure must equal 100percent so we know that if theprobability of success is equal to 25 % then then the probability of failure oryou can say the probability that astudent got the question wrong is equalto two 75 % 25 % plus 75 % gives us a totalprobability of a hundred percent okay sonow we have everything that we need toplug into our formula and before I giveyou the formula I 'm just going to scrolldown a little bit just to give myself alittle bit more space and the formulafor binomial distribution looks muchworse than it really is so just bearwith me and basically all this formulasays is that the probability of anyevent X is equal to the total number ofcombinations and I shortenedcombinations by just writing combos sothe probability is equal to the totalnumber of combinations multiplied byprobability of success with a K in theexponent K is just the the total numberof successes all multiplied by theprobability of failure with a n minus Kin the exponent and n minus K is justthe total number of failures okay solet 's plug everything into our formulawe 're trying to find the probabilitythat the student got four questionscorrect so so the probability that astudent got four questions correct isequal to the total number ofcombinations and I 'm going to talk aboutD combinations a little bit later so I'mjust going to leave that blank for nowand this is all multiplied by theprobability of success which we know theprobability of success is equal to 25 % or you could say 0.25 with our number ofsuccesses K in the exponent and we knowthat our K is equal to 4 so I 'll put a 4in the exponent and this is allmultiplied by the probability of failurewhich we know the probability of failureis equal to 75 % or 0.75 with the numberof failures in the exponent n minus Kand we know that the number of failuresis equal to 1 so I 'm going to put thatone in the exponent so now let 's go backto the first part of the formula andtalk about the total number ofcombinations but we have to find thetotal number of combinations that astudent can get four questions correctum so let 's say he could get the thefirst question incorrect and the rest ofthe four he gets correct the X meansincorrect and the O means correct or hecould get the the second questionincorrect and all the rest of themcorrect he could get the third questionincorrect and all the rest of themcorrect so on and so forthfourth question incorrect and the lastcombination is if he gets the first fourcorrect and the last question he getsincorrect so now let 's count howcombinations we have we have 1 2 3 4 5we have 5 different combinations wherethe student gets 4 questions correctso in our parenthesis our total numberof combinations we can put the number 5and for the more difficult problems it'smuch easier to find the total number ofcombinations using the formula nfactorial all divided by the number ofsuccesses K factorial multiplied by thenumber of failures and minus K factorialonce again this is the formula for thetotal number of combinations if weplugged everything into our formula wehave n which is the number 5 so we have5 factorial all divided by the letter Kour number is a set of number ofsuccesses which is 4 factorial allmultiplied by our number of failureswhich is 1 factorial and if you don'tknow what factorial means 5 factorialjust means 5 times 4 times 3 times 2times 1 this is all divided by 4factorial which is just 4 times 3 times2 times 1 multiplied by 1 factorialwhich is just 1 and if you plugged allthis into your calculator you would getour total number of combinations whichis 5 so going back to our originalproblem we 're finding the probabilitythat a student got exactly fourquestions correct so the probabilitythat a student got 4 questions correctis equal to 5 x 0.25 with a 4 exponentall multiplied by 0.75 with the oneexponent and if you plug that into yourcalculator we get an answer rounded tofour decimal points of 0.01 forsix or you could say one point four sixpercent so what is the probability thata student got exactly four questionscorrect that is one point four sixpercent so I hope this gave you a betteridea on binomial distribution and usingthat to find probability there are alittle bit more difficult examples whichI will make some more videos on so staytuned so I really hope that you areenjoying these and I will see you in mynext one Binomial Distribution - Probability Statistics Binomial Distribution - Probability Statistics Binomial Distribution - Probability
