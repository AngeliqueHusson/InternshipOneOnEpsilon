hello my name is Maria Miller from mathmom of calm in this video we are goingto look into comparing fractions nowfirst I have here some easy cases so tospeak where you can easily compare thetwo fractions and find out which one isbigger or more for example if we havetwo eighths and three eighths obviouslythree eighths is more you can see thatthe picture ' plus you can see thatthere 's more the pieces all you have toremember it is that if there are eightand eight it 's like the same size piecesall you do is compare how many piecesthey are so comparing like fractions thefractions with same kind of pieces iseasy it 's another type of situation wehave the same amount of pieces fourpieces and four pieces but it is stilleasy to compare because we know thatninths are bigger pieces than tents andchildren need to learn this principlethat they can not look at this number tenas making this fraction bigger theyinstead have to think that okay thereare less nines making whole pie you knownine 9 's makes a whole pie and then ifyou divide at the same point the tenseach piece is smaller so tenths aresmaller than ninth so this is more andit might be easily visible it might bevisible from the pictures to my picturesof course a hundred they are not superaccurate here in the video now it'sanother type of easy situation where wecompare to one half three sevenths isclearly less than on new half as you cansee the picture but even if you didn'thave other pictures you can still figurethat out easily because you know threeand a half over seven would be exactlyone half if we are if I had a threepoint five over seven that would be 1/2equal to half but it is three over sevenit is less than that okay and let 's sothese three also using these easyprinciples one halfand 712 okay now 6/12 would be exactlyone-half if you had 12 pieces and tooksix of them then that would be exactlyone half but I have more than 612 sothis is more than 1/2 here 6 eleventhsand 6/10 there are the same number ofpieces six pieces and six pieces buttents as pieces are bigger pieces thaneleventh so this is more here actuallynone of these principles work as suchbut most of us can easily visualize inyour mind that one fifth is thestill-living not very much you know onefifth and six nine it 's way more thanone half so it is obviously much moreokay this exercise has to do withfractions on a number line and a task isto order these three fractions fromsmallest to greatest and here to thesethree from smallest to the greatestwe 're going to use these three numberlines to help us this first number linegoes from zero to one and it is dividedinto three parts first part second partand third part so therefore from here tohere this much is one-third right thisfrom here to here is 2/3 and has threethirds and similarly here this numberline is divided into five parts is thefirst path second path the third pathetc and so from here to here is 1/5 fromhere to here this much is 2/5 and so onand the last one is divided into eightparts so it has eight 1/8 two eighthsand so on so I 'll just find 3/8 herethree dates would be this much this longone third would be from hereyeah and two fifths would be from hereto here and now I can see which fractionis the greatest or smallest or greatestokayby comparing the lengths of these linesI drew this one here is the shortest oneone-third sois the smallest and then it comes thisone 3/8 and lastly 2/5 is the greatestnow similarly here I 'm gon na find 2/3it 's this Mach here 2/3 would be thismuch 5/8 would be this long a line andthen 3/5 I 'm still hereand now 3/5 is the shortest and thencomes this 5/8 and lastly 2/3 this isjust a nice exercise even though itdoes n't really teach you any tricks asthe heart to compare fractions it stillhelp students understand how to seefractions on a number linenow sometimes none of these easy trickswork for comparing fractions but then westill have one more method to use andthat takes the most work but that alwaysworks it is that we will convert thesefractions to be compared so that theyhave the same denominator and to do thatwe need to find a common denominatorjust like when adding fractions this isthe same exact method we find a commondenominator and for 8 and 12I 'm looking at 8 and 12 I have to find anumber so that 12 goes evenly into itand 8 goes evenly into it a numberthat 's in the multiplication table of 8and in the multiplication table of 12now 24 works great okay and 8 times 3 is24 so 5 times 3 15 12 times 2 7 times 214 and now can compare 15 places is morethan 14 pieces ok it might not be aseasily visible in the picture because Ichose these fractions so that theyare n't fairly close here I 'm gon na usethe common denominator of 30 so simply 3times 10now go 3 times 10 so 1 times 10 and 10times 3 so 3 times 3okay again the fraction on this side isgreat let 's do a few more of those kindif I have two fractions here I cannotquite tell which one is bigger here I'mgonna change this to so that it has thenominal 10 5 times 2 is 10 2 times 2 is4 this I 'm not gon na change because nowas you can see I have the same amount ofpast 4 and 4 but tenths are bigger pastand elements so this is more I couldhave converted both fractions so thatthey would have 50 50 55 also hereI 'm gon na do the staff right then withthe same denominator the thing about thedenominator I 'll go in the multiples of16 16 32 32 is not divisible by 6 andthen 48 48 works ok 3 times 16 is 48 so3 times 13 39 then here 6 times a so 5times 8 what okay this one is moreslightly more I bet you could n't tellthe difference is philippi of thefraction so we need to use this morecomplicated method and here 9 8 and 13over 11 note that these are improperfractionsI could write them as mixed numbers butfor comparing it does n't matter I canjust use the same method as I did here Iwould now have to choose my denominatoras 88 eight times 11 is 88 so 8 times 11and then 9 times 11 and here11 times 8 so 13 times 8 which is 18plus 24 okaythat 's practically smallyou test
