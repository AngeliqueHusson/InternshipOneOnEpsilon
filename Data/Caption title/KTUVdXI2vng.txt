music mathematics math math happen bottom grounds mathematics turtle way cumulative build thats part take fairly prescribe order matrices big block procedure multiplying matrices need know matrices defined word fundamental object reason uncommon view mathematics giant pyramid object concept thing pick concrete example different type real integer remember counting taken include zero building pyramid define integer result subtract ing theyre possible get subtract ing one natural number another integer minus negative integer minus precisely define integer equivalence class particular collection pair natural example integer collection integer negative collection definition integer also inherit structure natural example integer associated x less equal integer associated x plus w less equal z plus order integer defined natural integer associated x plus integer associated z w equal integer associated x plus z comma plus w integer addition defined number addition check structure align intuition integer integer natural build theyre possible get dividing one integer another like divided similar previous construction integer define rational term integer one step also construct rational bit tricky something cal led cut cut split rational two set one set made rational cut set made rational cut let make cut rational less inone set rational equal another set cut way splitting rational rational number upper set cut define real number notice lower set doesnt biggest element rational number immediately rational number example always another rational number let define new cut lower set rational x x squared less upper set rational squared greater equal case element upper set would square root rational debtor cut number square root particular way split thought definition number square root two defined possible ways cut split cut element upper set one exist like three otherwise gap like square root two starting natural possible ways get integer divided possible ways get split rational possible ways get structure type number defined previous type way possible statement like pi less e squared reduced statement natural mathematical object thing defined term mathematical object math built simpler math hence pyramid idea process simplification word hold bottom late early real crisis mathematician mathematics foundation worried mathematics seeming lack foundation along advocate philosophical position known lotus ism logic plus ism basically say bottom pyramid mathematics logic mathematics logic essentially logic word goal lotus ism show pure mathematics follow purely logical term reduced statement statement loge assist want reduce natural everything else logic lead like exactly logic log ism philosophical position intended meaning word logic fundamentally philosophical mathematical definition difficult pinpoint different lodge assist mathematician generally lodge assess thought logical proposition proposition complete generality true virtue form rather content example law exclude middle composition p either p p logic feel simple natural never thats allow ground mathematics sit base pyramid late first person earnestly attempt carry loge assist project spent year develop ing extensive system logical axiom notation foundational system derived basic law arithmetic project alow success famously ruined f reges book going pointed f reges contradiction basic law v one could derive set set contain even though specific error inspired central give mathematics logical foundation together alf red north continued push low gen da three volume work reducing large section mathematics axiomatic system famously exhausted first hundred one plus one equal two axiom used pure logic essentially status mathematics system set theory axiom z f set theory even without sometimes controversial axiom choice one derive classical mathematics reduce known math eight nine axiom lotus success know thanks girdle never axiom system math impossible prove z f axiom never produce contradiction none found far another good sign unfortunately z f considered pure logic example axiom infinity exist infinite reasonably considered axiom pure form assert something content something basic logic snapper joke since least two nine axiom z f logical proposition sense ism fair say school percent give mathematics firm foundation log ism huge portion modern mathematical logic historical crisis mathematics weve never really figured whats bottom pyramid along way weve discovered ton fascinating mathematics philosophy hello lot awesome response episode pseudo random comment nature randomness come paradoxically excellent said believe hear pi past statistical randomness test never repeat also random thats interesting point maybe pass believe pass lot test randomness one believe pi normal number really mean distributed evenly theyre spread equally likely talk lot episode combining pi e check pan ked great question come random also really get question also say class cryptography basically ask people come upwith random number theres certain theyre gon na come upwith thats kind fun experiment maybe want give try related version actually tried class ask people sequence hundred random say pretend flip coin hundred times write head tail hundred times people actually flip coin hundred times write sequence look different people afraid let say five head row think doesnt seem random actually flip coin hundred times pretty good chance get something like five head row five tail row unlikely people write sequence actually random thats really fun experiment run classroom another comment c link click key fand randomly try guess one gon na click next pretty good see random make sequence whether interpret pattern next key time really beat maybe weve linked description really fun check crisis foundation mathematics infinite series crisis foundation mathematics infinite series crisis foundation mathematics infinite series
