today going take look continuity point pretty typical p response question give type function ask determine whether function continue given point along function right remember definition continuity point right going want answer question every time always ask justify answer refresh memory definition continuity point right function f continuous c following met right f c defined limit x approach es c f x exist third part limit x approach es c f x equal f c right going show determine whether function continuous x equal c value right going justify answer going touse three part right long one true hold going continuous c one three part exist function continuous point right usually way like set tell student response since say justify answer assume person gray paper know thinking going tobe right since determine whether f continuous x equal right going literally write right might start something like f tobe continuous x equal following must met point may probably realize oh hey discuss three point definition continuity point right however point telling continuous following must met soon show one condition met would continuous able show three part sare continuous met show continuous right outline nicely right first thing going consider first part right defined word one since c one got show f must defined first part show right going going f going plug see get well x function f equal right defined right say f equal defined right would probably good enough part written showing f equal f one going defined find good first condition tokay second part limit c f x exist right word one limit x approach es f x exist right trying prove one going calculate limit limit x approach es f x equal snow let say figure limit coming left less equal right limit would one right coming right x greater equal coming right plug one two minus one going one limit limit f equal limit exist alright proved second part true right let check third part limit definition limit x approach es f x must equal f limit x approach es f x must equal f k already calculated right show limit f x said already calculated part say f equal said condition two thing must equal obviously equal right conclusion therefore limit x approach es f x equal f k one fail one met one mad one therefore function continuous one right overall conclusion right therefore since use definition continuity point say definition continuity point f continuous x equal right question determined whether f continuous answer writing absolutely everything took definition continuity point took took individually draw conclusion individually could look whole determine overall definition continuous right nice well written answer p free response question deal continuity thanks watching video go ahead give like share friend thanks p calculus b f r question continuity point p calculus b f r question continuity point p calculus b f r question continuity point p calculus b f r question continuity point p calculus b f r question continuity point p calculus b f r question continuity point p calculus b f r question continuity point p calculus b f r question continuity point p calculus b f r question continuity point
