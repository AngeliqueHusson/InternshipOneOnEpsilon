a professor at the University of Maryland asked thisawesomely evil test question you have the opportunity to earn extra points forthis examselect whether you want two points or six pointsbut there 's a small catch if more than 10 percent in the class pick six pointsthen no one will get any points only I will see your selection it will beanonymous to the rest of the classdo you pick two points or six points ? when this question wasposted to Twitter it went viral with a lot of people discussing the questionit looks like there 's a dilemma here and a lot of people thought thatlook if we at least pick two points everyone can cooperate then at least wecan get twobut that 's not the game theory way to think about this questionso let 's try and to analyze what the correct strategic decisionshould be given the incentives of this questionyou want to think about your choicerelative to what the other people in the class are doingand the relevant characteristic is how many peopleare picking 6 it could be that more than 10 percent in the class is picking 6it could be the case that fewer than 10 percent in the class is picking sixor there 's a small probability that may be exactly 10 percent of the otherpeople are picking 6we 'll construct a matrix based on what the other people are doingto see what your payoff will be if more than 10 percent in the classis picking 6 then it does n't matter whether you pick two or sixeveryone is going to get zero pointsnow , if fewer than 10 percent to the other people are picking sixsay everyone else is picking two then you are going to get the number pointsthat you pickif you pick two points you get two , if you pick six points you get sixand now you can see something very interesting you arealways better off at least as good of picking 6as if you are picking two so picking six hereis a logical choice whether the class is more than 10 percent picking 6or less than 10 percentpicking 6 you are always going to score more points if you pick 6versus 2 now there 's onethird case to consider that may be exactly 10 percent pick 6in this case you would get two if you picked twobut you would ruin it for everyone and get zeroif you pick 6 you would , you know , increase the threshold beyond 10 percentso in this one small scenarioyou 're actually better off picking two points but is kindarare and there 's no way you can know that exactly 10 percent in the classis picking 6 so in a class of ten that would beexactly one person picking 6 and everyone elsepicking two this is a very unlikely scenarioso you can kinda disregard this third possibility and you could say picking 6is the logical thing to dobut there 's another reason to think about why picking six is logicalexams are not usually based on the absolute number of points you getit 's not usually a point threshold that ninety percent is in a eighty percent is a Bthat 's usually true in grade school or high school but once you get to collegeeverything is usually graded on a curve your gradeis based on how much better you do relative to everyone elseso you do n't want to think about the absolute number of points you 're gettingyou want to think about how many more points you 're getting than other peopleso when you think in this relativistic methodif you get 2 and everyone else gets 2 your getting zero extra pointswhereas if you get six and other people get 2then you have a chance to get four extra points so we want to reduce the payoutswhen points are awarded by twoso if the class is getting more than 10 percent 's picking 6 no one 's gettingpoints anywayif you fewer than 10 percent are picking 6then when you pick two if everyone gets two , you 're not getting any more points than anyone else who 's picking 2but if you get six and other people are getting two you get four extra pointsand then look at the third scenario where exactly 10 percent is picking sixso say one in 10out of your ten percent class is picking six andone person 's picking six and every one else is picking twothen you 're not going to do any better than the people who are picking twoand if you pick six and spoil it for everyone then youget zero so when you look at the payouts nowpicking six is always at least as good as picking twoso in this case picking 6 is the logical choiceand it 's what 's known as a weakly dominant strategy so when you have aweakly dominant strategy you 're gon na wan na play itnow the unfortunate outcome even though everyone individually is thinking aboutpicking six and they all pick sixyou end in a situation that everyone ends up with zero pointsbut this is not because any individual person is thinking wrongthis game is sorta rigged so that the group outcome sorta says oh you pick 6you 're selfishbut that 's not really the case I think it should be your decision to pick sixand that 's the logical thing to do thanks for watching this videoif you like more videos about game theory and math please subscribe to mychannelyou can catch me on my blog mind your decisions which you can follow onFacebook Google+ and Petronyou can also catch me on social media at Presh Talwalkerand if you like this video please check out my books I 've written a book aboutgame theory an introduction to strategic thinkingwhich will help you understand this example and many more ways to usemath tooutsmart your opponents test
