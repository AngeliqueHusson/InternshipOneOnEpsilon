today going take really brief introduction indefinite integration take two topic nice brief introduction video going part right second example well go example right really need foundation start beginning chapter textbook starting deal integration use older word introduce introduce give formal definition right later classes particularly id usually dont use word anti derivative differentiation indefinite integration thats use formal definition um definition function capital notation izle mean lot function function capital f little f interval capital f prime x equal f x x interval yes formal definition might totally make sense right basically get idea anti derivative thinking undoing derivative right thats nice little easy way ease right really let say ended function get really simple function x equal say right want try find trial error think process sort thing right need come capital f according definition capital f x right function took derivative end thinking power rule exponent front subtract ing one right would x squared right anti derivative take derivative would two front subtract ing exponent kind undoing derivative right really really simple right let say another one might little bit harder f x equal maybe say x squared right would right well ended two took derivative would three subtract one right question ended one would three two x two ghetto well hopefully see would one third right theres anti derivative k three one third times three would give one subtract ing exponent would give two right kind like little game kind thinking work right really really simple function really simple deal going simple k going come general solution right let take general solution get definition alright want connect maybe start calling indefinite integration act also cal led indefinite going call integration thats common word today use regular basis alright start indefinite mean going general solution formal definition textbook integral symbol shape right alright going integrate f x x equal capital f x plus c right want go define thing right tell us looking function right scalled integrand thats integrand right x x right tell variable integration right variable integration function written term written term letter dont always x right right going anti derivative f x right plus c constant integration give us general solution constant integration right able read understand whats going going kind really important like textbook use capital f little formal definition show student little bit something different normally name capital letter right usually dont say capital f whatever take derivative usually use little f denote function derivative f prime formula let go ahead put red right notation commonly thats used class integrate derivative x x going get back original function classic would plain f x c lower case letter sand derivative f whats commonly class kind seem make sense student right thought id point k going go take four basic integration rule right going call quits part one first basic integration rule want take integrate x right time integrate x get constant right stop think random number like four whatever take derivative goes right thats one self explanatory one integrate number x thats going integrate number x plus c right let pull example going integrate according right would answer plus c alright ask stop think make sense right x derivative get right make sense right third rule say integrate got number times function x pull front integral sign go ahead continue integrate like normal right look example without actually integration let say maybe sine x function right sine x theres number front pull front integration sign pull four front got sine x x alright would continue integrate come final answer alright going right one getting basic right last basic integration rule basically say two function right either subtract ing really doesnt make difference usually put square bracket around everything inside especially youve got minus es keep integral sign set separate take break whoops take break two separate integral right notice youve got integral f x x youve got make sure put x plus minus whichever would happen g x x important thing make sure every time youve got integral sign youve got also x variable integration one right first video really really brief introduction anti differentiation
