Let 's say you 're me , and you 're in math class , and you 're supposed to be learning about factoring.Trouble is , your teacher is too busytrying to convince you that factoringis a useful skill for the average person to know , with real-world applications ranging from passing your stateexams all the way to getting a higher SAT score.And unfortunately , does not have the timeto show you why factoring is actually interesting.It 's perfectly reasonable for youto get bored in this situation.So like any reasonable person , you start doodling.Maybe it 's because your teacher 's soporific voicereminds you of a lullaby , but you 're drawing stars.And because you're me , you quicklyget bored of the usual five-pointed starand get to wondering , why five ? So you start exploring.It seems obvious that a five-pointed staris the simplest one , the one thattakes the least number of strokes to draw.Sure , you can make a start with four points , but that 's not really a star the way you 're defining stars.Then there 's a six-pointed star , whichis also pretty familiar , but totallydifferent from the five-pointed starbecause it takes two separate lines to make.And then you're thinking about how , much like you can put two triangles togetherto make a six-pointed star , you can put two squares togetherto make an eight-pointed star.And any even-numbered star with p points can be made out of twop/2-gons.It is at this point that you realizethat if you wanted to avoid thinking about factoring , maybe drawing stars was not the greatest idea.But wait , four would be an even number of points , but that would mean you could make it out of two 2-gons.Maybe you were taught polygons with only two sidesca n't exist.But for the purposes of drawing stars , it works out rather well.Sure , the four-pointed star does n't look too star-like.But then you realize you can make the six-pointed star outof three of these things , and you'vegot an asterisk , which is definitely a legitimate star.In fact , for any star where the number of pointsis divisible by 2 , you can draw it asterisk style.But that 's not quite what you 're looking for.What you want is a doodle game , and here it is.Draw p points in a circle , evenly spaced.Pick a number Q.Starting at one point , go around the circleand connect to the point two places over.Repeat.If you get to the starting place before you'vecovered all the points , jump to a lonely point , and keep going.That 's how you draw stars.And it 's a successful game , in that previously youwere considering running screaming from the room.Or the window was open , so that 's an option , too.But now , you 're not only entertained but beginningto become curious about the nature of this game.The interesting thing is that the more points you have , the more different ways there is to draw the star.I happen to like seven-pointed stars because there'stwo really good ways to draw them , but they 're still simple.I would like to note here that I 've never actually lefta math class by the window , not that Ican say the same for other subjects.Eight is interesting , too , because not only arethere a couple nice ways to draw it , but one 's a composite of two polygons , while another can be drawn without picking up the pencil.Then there 's nine , which , in additionto a couple of other nice versions , you can make out of three triangles.And because you're me , and you 're a nerd , and you like to amuse yourself , youdecide to call this kind of star a square starbecause that 's kind of a funny name.So you start drawing other square stars.Four 4-gons , two 2-gons , even the completely degenerate caseof one 1-gon.Unfortunately , five pentagons is already difficult to discern.And beyond that , it 's very hard to see and appreciatethe structure of square stars.So you get bored and move on to 10 dotsin a circle , which is interestingbecause this is the first number whereyou can make a star as a composite of smallerstars -- that is , two boring old five-pointed stars.Unless you count asterisk stars , in which case 8 was two4s 's or four 2's or two 2 's and a 4.But 10 is interesting because you can make itas a composite in more than one waybecause it's divisible by 5 , whichitself can be made in two ways.Then there 's 11 , which can't be made out of separate partsat all because 11 is prime.Though here you start to wonder howto predict how many times around the circlewe 'll go before getting back to start.But instead of exploring the exciting worldof modular arithmetic , you move on to 12 , which is a really cool number because ithas a whole bunch of factors.And then something starts to bother you.Is a 25-pointed star composite madeof five five-pointed stars a square star ? You had been thinking only of pentagonsbecause the lower numbers did n't have this question.How could you have missed that ? Maybe your teacher said somethinginteresting about prime numbers , and you accidentallylost focus for a moment.I do n't know.It gets even worse.6 squared would be a 36-pointed star made of six hexagons.But if you allow use of six-pointed stars , then it 's the same as a composite of 12 triangles.And that does n't seem in keeping with the spiritof square stars.You 'll have to define square stars more strictly.But you do like the idea that there'sthree ways to make the seventh square star.Anyway , the whole theory of what kind of starscan be made with what numbers is quite interesting.And I encourage you to explore this during your math class .
