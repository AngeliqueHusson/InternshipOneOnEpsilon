g'day I 'm James from the global mathproject and have a very unusual questionfor us today it 's a very human questionbut does n't seem that way at firstin fact the global math project is allabout our human relationship withmathematics in two sense of the wordmath makes itself is for these wonderfulstorylines of beauty intrigue mysterychallenge delight and joy plus there 's ahuman historical relationship inmathematics after all we 've been doingmathematics that thousands of yearsthere 's got to be something to it thatthe story of the development math isfull of intrigue mystery and joy as welland we want to talk about both aspectsin particular during the global mathweek we 'll come up with one particularstory of mathematics which isastoundingly joyful all right veryexciting for 2017 but for now here 's myinteresting question my very humannon-human question goes as follows howmany degrees are in a Martian circlewell indeed a very non-human question atfirst it seems okay how many degrees ina Martian circle happen I possibly pickmy way through that okay why should oneapproach one approach let 's ask theanalogous question hit us on earth howmany degrees are in an Earthling circlewe know the answer that 360 degrees habut that begs another question 360 thinkabout it that 's a very strange numberwho chose the number 360 out of the bluewhat 's that got to do with there here tothink of a number this is on your honorwhich account 360 is the first choicevery strange so where did that come fromwell actually if you look at the historyof mathematics as you go on the internetwill look at the history books you'llfind math the stories are actually clearon why us humans chose that particularnumber than other degrees in a circlethere 's certainly lots of theories outthere there 's one very compelling theorythat I 'm going to go with today so let'sstick with this one theory one of themany and let 's use it as a wonderfulthought exercise to go from theEarthlings answer and ask see now it'sanalogous question for Martians okayhere goesit is known that this number 360 wasbeing used by the Babylonians some threethousand years ago so the question iswhat made them choose the number 360well let 's think of it this way okay soimagine you an Earthling plunked on thisparticular planet and charged with thetask come up with a good number ofdegrees for a circle hmm so you 're gonnathink circles circle cycles what 's agood enough of a cycle for a circlewhat I 'm an Earthling on this planetthere 's one very natural cycle thatsticks in your brain it 's actually thenumber of days in the year we experienceyears all the time we go from winter tospring to summer to fall from winter tospring to summer to autumn we go througha nettle cycle so I think cycle Inaturally think days of a yearso the Babylonians were very well thanother days in the year the newest 365news 365 and a watervery clever folk back then so that makesyou then wonder well then why didn'tthey choose the number 365 and a quarterof the number degrees in a circle ifwe 're going with this particular theoryfor that origin of that number all rightnow let 's be very human again let 's behuman 365 water think about it do youwant to in mathematics the number 365and a quarter all the time it 's horribleno of course you do n't so you probablywant to round that to a friendliernumber so let 's think about this whatwould you run it to now 365 the quarterif I round to the nearest integerI get 365 so maybe we 'll work with thenumber 365 for the number of degrees inthe circle instead or actually you mightchoose to round it not to the nearestinteger but say to the nearest 10 thesolicitor 's go for a big chunkier number365 there 's 10 actually rounds up to 370the core to this theory the balancedid n't round up to 370 they chose thestead to round down to 360 surroundingthere 's ten I 'd naturally choose 370 whythey go down to 360 in this particulartheory ha all right now let 's be ourhuman cells again let 's take our waythrough this all right we 're doingmathematics 3,000 years ago and all webasically our heads we got no person topay we have to do it all in their headsso often in math notes you want to havethings to take thirds of things andquarters and so forth and fifths soarithmetic which of these numbers isfriendliest of the arithmetic what I'mhaving 365 is not very friendly it 's notfeels about 2 so I probably would n't gowith 365 only because there 's notnatural to Harvard I can have 370 I'mhalf 360 little bit dividing 2 3 taking1/3 or something well 360 is Tamila by3s that 's good but actually 370 is n't soif you just want to 1/3 370 has beenawkwardwe 're not quarters actually 360 studentsby 4370 is n't all three cities looking goodin fact 360 is divisible by five as wellas she saw us 370 360 is also divided by6370 is n't de Vil 's y7 actually reallyany he 's double was 7 somewhere s 7 860 is divisible by 8 370 is not 9 3 6 /9 370 is not 10all right the post was about 10 11 yeahawkward no 12 is it was about 12 bye-byewhat 15 and 18 and 20 is there 's lots ofthings 360 is a highly divisible numberso if you 're doing with fatigue in yourhead it 's a very friendly number to workwith 370 is not rude to visible or notthere is one many things at all so let'snot go over 370 let 's make math easy forourselves and go with 360 that is a veryhuman answer that why but money go fromthe number two the number 360 from to365 and a quarter great alright so thereis one very plausible theory about whywe Earthlings came up with a number 360so what be the analogous reasoning forMartians all right so now you 're aMartian being plunked on the planet Marsand you 're being charged with the taskof cope with a number of degrees of acircle so how would you reason well thisthis approach is say okay a naturalcycle I 've experienced is it Martianhere how many days are in a Martian yearwell actually have to know the Asterthat we Earthlings do n't call them dayswe actually call them souls and I happento know there are 668 souls in a Martianyear so if you 're on Mars you'llexperience the cycle of 6 from 6 t8souls so you 're putting that naturallyassociate the number 608the circle now here 's the questiondelete Martians want to do arithmeticwith the number 6 from 68 all the timesince it 'll be full experiment for youwhat w-would you personally round thisto to make life easy for you if you'redoing net arithmetic on Mars so how manydegrees are in a Martian circle do youthink lovely stuff thank youyou test
