Rewrite the expression below applyingthe commutative and associative properties of addition.And then show that both expressionsyield the same result.So one , we could just evaluate the expression the wayit 's written.And then we can kind of mess aroundwith it using the commutative and associative propertiesof addition.So let 's first add 17.5 plus 3.So that 's going to give us 20.5.So this is going to be 20.5.And then to that , we're going to add negative 7.5.Now , adding negative 7.5 is the exact same thingas subtracting 7.5.So this is going to be equal to -- the 0.5 's cancel out.And then 20 minus 7 is 13.So that 's our first way of getting the answer.And we kind of adhered to the parentheses.Now let 's use the commutative property.The commutative property tells usthat the order does n't matter.We can commute these numbers around.They can move , commute.It 's like you 're going to work.They can move around.So let 's just move the numbers around.Let 's make it -- actually , we coulddo all sorts of crazy things.We could just change the order here.We could make this negative 7.5 plus 17.5 plus 3.We could keep the parentheses , just like that.So we would have essentially just changedthe order of this expression right over here.But let 's use both the commutativeand the associative properties.So now we 've commuted everything around.And now we can re-associate everything.So instead of putting the parentheses like that , we could put the parentheses like that.So that 's what the associative property tells us.So let me write this down.So associative property of additiontells us that a plus b plus c -- we do a plus b first -- is the same thing as a plus b plus c , where you do b plus cfirst.The commutative property tells usthat a plus b is equal to b plus a , that you can move these guys around.So let 's evaluate this one.We actually got here using both the commutativeand the associative property.So we get negative 7.5 plus 17.5.This is the exact same thing as 17.5 minus 7.5.It might be easier for you to realize , OK , I 'm adding two numbers of different signs , so what I could do is take the difference between the two.And since the larger number is positive , I have a larger number.Or you could just view this as 17.5 minus 7.5.So 17.5 minus 7.5 -- the 0.5 's cancel out.17 minus 7 is 10.So this part right here becomes 10.And then we still have the plus 3 there.And that , once again , is going to be equal to 13.And we could keep commuting this aroundand keep re-associating it.No matter how we do it , we are going to get 13 .
