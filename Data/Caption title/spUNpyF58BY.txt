This right here is what we 're going to build to , this video : A certain animated approach to thinking about a super-important idea from math : The Fourier transform . For anyone unfamiliar with what that is , my # 1 goal here is just for the video to be an introduction to that topic . But even for those of you who are already familiar with it , I still think that there 's something fun and enriching about seeing what all of its components actually look like . The central example , to start , is gon na be the classic one : Decomposing frequencies from sound . But after that , I also really wan na show a glimpse of how this idea extends well beyond sound and frequency , and to many seemingly disparate areas of math , and even physics . Really , it is crazy just how ubiquitous this idea is . Let 's dive in . This sound right here is a pure A . 440 beats per second . Meaning , if you were to measure the air pressure right next to your headphones , or your speaker , as a function of time , it would oscillate up and down around its usual equilibrium , in this wave . making 440 oscillations each second . A lower-pitched note , like a D , has the same structure , just fewer beats per second . And when both of them are played at once , what do you think the resulting pressure vs. time graph looks like ? Well , at any point in time , this pressure difference is gon na be the sum of what it would be for each of those notes individually . Which , let 's face it , is kind of a complicated thing to think about . At some points , the peaks match up with each other , resulting in a really high pressure . At other points , they tend to cancel out . And all in all , what you get is a wave-ish pressure vs. time graph , that is not a pure sine wave ; it 's something more complicated . And as you add in other notes , the wave gets more and more complicated . But right now , all it is is a combination of four pure frequencies . So it seems ... needlessly complicated , given the low amount of information put into it . A microphone recording any sound just picks up on the air pressure at many different points in time . It only `` sees '' the final sum . So our central question is gon na be how you can take a signal like this , and decompose it into the pure frequencies that make it up . Pretty interesting , right ? Adding up those signals really mixes them all together . So pulling them back apart ... feels akin to unmixing multiple paint colors that have all been stirred up together . The general strategy is gon na be to build for ourselves a mathematical machine that treats signals with a given frequency ... ..differently from how it treats other signals . To start , consider simply taking a pure signal say , with a lowly three beats per second , so that we can plot it easily . And let 's limit ourselves to looking at a finite portion of this graph . In this case , the portion between zero seconds , and 4.5 seconds . The key idea , is gon na be to take this graph , and sort of wrap it up around a circle . Concretely , here 's what I mean by that . Imagine a little rotating vector where each point in time its length is equal to the height of our graph for that time . So , high points of the graph correspond to a greater disance from the origin , and low points end up closer to the origin . And right now , I 'm drawing it in such a way that moving forward two seconds in time corresponds to a single rotation around the circle . Our little vector drawing this wound up graph is rotating at half a cycle per second . So , this is important . There are two different frequencies at play here : There 's the frequency of our signal , which goes up and down , three times per second . And then , separately , there 's the frequency with which we 're wrapping the graph around the circle . Which , at the moment , is half of a rotation per second . But we can adjust that second frequency however we want . Maybe we want to wrap it around faster ... ..or maybe we go and wrap it around slower . And that choice of winding frequency determines what the wound up graph looks like . Some of the diagrams that come out of this can be pretty complicated ; although , they are very pretty . But it 's important to keep in mind that all that 's happening here is that we 're wrapping the signal around a circle . The vertical lines that I 'm drawing up top , by the way , are just a way to keep track of the distance on the original graph that corresponds to a full rotation around the circle . So , lines spaced out by 1.5 seconds would mean it takes 1.5 seconds to make one full revolution . And at this point , we might have some sort of vague sense that something special will happen when the winding frequency matches the frequency of our signal : three beats per second . All the high points on the graph happen on the right side of the circle And all of the low points happen on the left . But how precisely can we take advantage of that in our attempt to build a frequency-unmixing machine ? Well , imagine this graph is having some kind of mass to it , like a metal wire . This little dot is going to represent the center of mass of that wire . As we change the frequency , and the graph winds up differently , that center of mass kind of wobbles around a bit . And for most of the winding frequencies , the peaks and valleys are all spaced out around the circle in such a way that the center of mass stays pretty close to the origin . But ! When the winding frequency is the same as the frequency of our signal , in this case , three cycles per second , all of the peaks are on the right , and all of the valleys are on the left.. ..so the center of mass is unusually far to the right . Here , to capture this , let 's draw some kind of plot that keeps track of where that center of mass is for each winding frequency . Of course , the center of mass is a two-dimensional thing , and requires two coordinates to fully keep track of , but for the moment , let 's only keep track of the x coordinate . So , for a frequency of 0 , when everything is bunched up on the right , this x coordinate is relatively high . And then , as you increase that winding frequency , and the graph balances out around the circle , the x coordinate of that center of mass goes closer to 0 , and it just kind of wobbles around a bit . But then , at three beats per second , there 's a spike as everything lines up to the right . This right here is the central construct , so let 's sum up what we have so far : We have that original intensity vs. time graph , and then we have the wound up version of that in some two-dimensional plane , and then , as a third thing , we have a plot for how the winding frequency influences the center of mass of that graph . And by the way , let 's look back at those really low frequencies near 0 . This big spike around 0 in our new frequency plot just corresponds to the fact that the whole cosine wave is shifted up . If I had chosen a signal oscillates around 0 , dipping into negative values , then , as we play around with various winding frequences , this plot of the winding frequencies vs. center of mass would only have a spike at the value of three . But , negative values are a little bit weird and messy to think about especially for a first example , so let 's just continue thinking in terms of the shifted-up graph . I just want you to understand that that spike around 0 only corresponds to the shift . Our main focus , as far as frequency decomposition is concerned , is that bump at three . This whole plot is what I 'll call the `` Almost Fourier Transform '' of the original signal . There 's a couple small distinctions between this and the actual Fourier transform , which I 'll get to in a couple minutes , but already , you might be able to see how this machine lets us pick out the frequency of a signal . Just to play around with it a little bit more , take a different pure signal , let 's say with a lower frequency of two beats per second , and do the same thing . Wind it around a circle , imagine different potential winding frequencies , and as you do that keep track of where the center of mass of that graph is , and then plot the x coordinate of that center of mass as you adjust the winding frequency . Just like before , we get a spike when the winding frequency is the same as the signal frequency , which in this case , is when it equals two cycles per second . But the real key point , the thing that makes this machine so delightful , is how it enables us to take a signal consisting of multiple frequencies , and pick out what they are . Imagine taking the two signals we just looked at : The wave with three beats per second , and the wave with two beats per second , and add them up . Like I said earlier , what you get is no longer a nice , pure cosine wave ; it 's something a little more complicated . But imagine throwing this into our winding-frequency machine ... ..it is certainly the case that as you wrap this thing around , it looks a lot more complicated ; you have this chaos ( 1 ) and chaos ( 2 ) and chaos ( 3 ) and chaos ( 4 ) and then WOOP ! Things seem to line up really nicely at two cycles per second , and as you continue on it 's more chaos ( 5 ) and more chaos ( 6 ) more chaos ( 7 ) chaos ( 8 ) , chaos ( 9 ) , chaos ( 10 ) , WOOP ! Things nicely align again at three cycles per second . And , like I said before , the wound up graph can look kind of busy and complicated , but all it is is the relatively simple idea of wrapping the graph around a circle . It 's just a more complicated graph , and a pretty quick winding frequency . Now what 's going on here with the two different spikes , is that if you were to take two signals , and then apply this Almost-Fourier transform to each of them individually , and then add up the results , what you get is the same as if you first added up the signals , and then applied this Almost-Fourier transorm . And the attentive viewers among you might wan na pause and ponder , and ... ..convince yourself that what I just said is actually true . It 's a pretty good test to verify for yourself that it 's clear what exactly is being measured inside this winding machine . Now this property makes things really useful to us , because the transform of a pure frequency is close to 0 everywhere except for a spike around that frequency . So when you add together two pure frequencies , the transform graph just has these little peaks above the frequencies that went into it . So this little mathematical machine does exactly what we wanted . It pulls out the original frequencies from their jumbled up sums , unmixing the mixed bucket of paint . And before continuing into the full math that describes this operation , let 's just get a quick glimpse of one context where this thing is useful : Sound editing . Let 's say that you have some recording , and it 's got an annoying high pitch that you 'd like to filter out . Well , at first , your signal is coming in as a function of various intensities over time . Different voltages given to your speaker from one millisecond to the next . But we want to think of this in terms of frequencies , so , when you take the Fourier transform of that signal , the annoying high pitch is going to show up just as a spike at some high frequency . Filtering that out , by just smushing the spike down , what you 'd be looking at is the Fourier transform of a sound that 's just like your recording , only without that high frequency . Luckily , there 's a notion of an inverse Fourier transform that tells you which signal would have produced this as its Fourier transform . I 'll be talking about inverse much more fully in the next video , but long story short , applying the Fourier transform to the Fourier transform gives you back something close to the original function . Mm , kind of ... this is ... ..a little bit of a lie , but it 's in the direction of the truth . And most of the reason that it 's a lie is that I still have yet to tell you what the actual Fourier Transform is , since it 's a little more complex than this x-coordinate-of-the-center-of-mass idea . First off , bringing back this wound up graph , and looking at its center of mass , the x coordinate is really only half the story , right ? I mean , this thing is in two dimensions , it 's got a y coordinate as well . And , as is typical in math , whenever you 're dealing with something two-dimensional , it 's elegant to think of it as the complex plane , where this center of mass is gon na be a complex number , that has both a real and an imaginary part . And the reason for talking in terms of complex numbers , rather than just saying , `` It has two coordinates , '' is that complex numbers lend themselves to really nice descriptions of things that have to do with winding , and rotation . For example : Euler 's formula famously tells us that if you take e to some number times i , you 're gon na land on the point that you get if you were to walk that number of units around a circle with radius 1 , counter-clockwise starting on the right . So , imagine you wanted to describe rotating at a rate of one cycle per second . One thing that you could do is take the expression `` e^2π*i*t , '' where t is the amount of time that has passed . Since , for a circle with radius 1 , 2π describes the full length of its circumference . And ... this is a little bit dizzying to look at , so maybe you wan na describe a different frequency ... ..something lower and more reasonable ... ..and for that , you would just multiply that time t in the exponent by the frequency , f. For example , if f was one tenth , then this vector makes one full turn every ten seconds , since the time t has to increase all the way to ten before the full exponent looks like 2πi . I have another video giving some intuition on why this is the behavior of e^x for imaginary inputs , if you 're curious 😉 , but for right now , we 're just gon na take it as a given . Now why am I telling you this you this , you might ask . Well , it gives us a really nice way to write down the idea of winding up the graph into a single , tight little formula . First off , the convention in the context of Fourier transforms is to think about rotating in the clockwise direction , so let 's go ahead and throw a negative sign up into that exponent . Now , take some function describing a signal intensity vs. time , like this pure cosine wave we had before , and call it g ( t ) . If you multiply this exponential expression times g ( t ) , it means that the rotating complex number is getting scaled up and down according to the value of this function . So you can think of this little rotating vector with its changing length as drawing the wound up graph . So think about it , this is awesome . This really small expression is a super-elegant way to encapsulate the whole idea of winding a graph around a circle with a variable frequency f. And remember , that thing we want to do with this wound up graph is to track its center of mass . So think about what formula is going to capture that . Well , to approximate it at least , you might sample a whole bunch of times from the original signal , see where those points end up on the wound up graph , and then just take an average . That is , add them all together , as complex numbers , and then divide by the number of points that you 've sampled . This will become more accurate if you sample more points which are closer together . And in the limit , rather than looking at the sum of a whole bunch of points divided by the number of points , you take an integral of this function , divided by the size of the time interval that we 're looking at . Now the idea of integrating a complex-valued function might seem weird , and to anyone who 's shaky with calculus , maybe even intimidating , but the underlying meaning here really does n't require any calculus knowledge . The whole expression is just the center of mass of the wound up graph . So ... Great ! Step-by-step , we have built up this kind of complicated , but , let 's face it , surprisingly small expression for the whole winding machine idea that I talked about . And now , there is only one final distinction to point out between this and the actual , honest-to-goodness Fourier transform . Namely , just do n't divide out by the time interval . The Fourier transform is just the integral part of this . What that means is that instead of looking at the center of mass , you would scale it up by some amount . If the portion of the original graph you were using spanned three seconds , you would multiply the center of mass by three . If it was spanning six seconds , you would multiply the center of mass by six . Physically , this has the effect that when a certain frequency persists for a long time , then the magnitude of the Fourier transform at that frequency is scaled up more and more . For example , what we 're looking at right here is how when you have a pure frequency of two beats per second , and you wind it around the graph at two cycles per second , the center of mass stays in the same spot , right ? It 's just tracing out the same shape . But the longer that signal persists , the larger the value of the Fourier transform , at that frequency . For other frequencies , though , even if you just increase it by a bit , this is cancelled out by the fact that for longer time intervals you 're giving the wound up graph more of a chance to balance itself around the circle . That is ... a lot of different moving parts , so let 's step back and summarize what we have so far . The Fourier transform of an intensity vs. time function , like g ( t ) , is a new function , which does n't have time as an input , but instead takes in a frequency , what I 've been calling `` the winding frequency . '' In terms of notation , by the way , the common convention is to call this new function `` g-hat , '' with a little circumflex on top of it . Now the output of this function is a complex number , some point in the 2D plane , that corresponds to the strength of a given frequency in the original signal . The plot that I 've been graphing for the Fourier transform , is just the real component of that output , the x-coordinate But you could also graph the imaginary component separately , if you wanted a fuller description . And all of this is being encapsulated inside that formula that we built up . And out of context , you can imagine how seeing this formula would seem sort of daunting . But if you understand how exponentials correspond to rotation ... ..how multiplying that by the function g ( t ) means drawing a wound up version of the graph , and how an integral of a complex-valued function can be interpreted in terms of a center-of-mass idea , you can see how this whole thing carries with it a very rich , intuitive meaning . And , by the way , one quick small note before we can call this wrapped up . Even though in practice , with things like sound editing , you 'll be integrating over a finite time interval , the theory of Fourier transforms is often phrased where the bounds of this integral are -∞ and ∞ . Concretely , what that means is that you consider this expression for all possible finite time intervals , and you just ask , `` What is its limit as that time interval grows to ∞ ? '' And ... man , oh man , there is so much more to say ! So much , I do n't wan na call it done here . This transform extends to corners of math well beyond the idea of extracting frequencies from signal . So , the next video I put out is gon na go through a couple of these , and that 's really where things start getting interesting . So , stay subscribed for when that comes out , or an alternate option is to just binge a couple 3blue1brown videos so that the YouTube recommender is more inclined to show you new things that come out ... ..really , the choice is yours ! And to close things off , I have something pretty fun : A mathematical puzzler from this video 's sponsor , Jane Street , who 's looking to recruit more technical talent . So , let 's say that you have a closed , bounded convex set C sitting in 3D space , and then let B be the boundary of that space , the surface of your complex blob . Now imagine taking every possible pair of points on that surface , and adding them up , doing a vector sum . Let 's name this set of all possible sums D. Your task is to prove that D is also a convex set . So , Jane Street is a quantitative trading firm , and if you 're the kind of person who enjoys math and solving puzzles like this , the team there really values intellectual curiosity . So , they might be interested in hiring you . And they 're looking both for full-time employees and interns . For my part , I can say that some people I 've interacted with there just seem to love math , and sharing math , and when they 're hiring they look less at a background in finance than they do at how you think , how you learn , and how you solve problems , hence the sponsorship of a 3blue1brown video .
