in this table we have the price range inone row and the frequency in another 15pens that cost between 10 and 20 rupeeswere sold 20 pens that cost between 20and 30 rupees were sold and so onfrequency is simply the number of timessomething has occurred or you can sayhow frequently something has occurredand these intervals as we can see acontinuous the upper limit of 1 is thesame as the lower limit of its nextinterval we saw how we can draw ahistogram for continuous class intervalswe have the X and the y axis we have theclass intervals on the x-axis and thefrequency on the y axis for the interval10 to 20 we draw a bar to represent 15pens for 20 to 30 we draw a bar torepresent 20 pens observe that herethere are no gaps between the bars likewe had in the bar graph in the same waywe draw bars for the remaining 3intervals we use histograms to representclass intervals while drawing ahistogram we have the class intervals onthe x axis while for a bar graph we havecategories but here 's something reallyinteresting sometimes we may not need todraw the entire histogram instead ofdrawing bars for the histogram we drawsomething like this let 's remove thebars and see how it looksthis just about tells you what thefrequency is for a particular classinterval this is called the frequencypolygon frequency as it represents thefrequency of each class interval andpolygon as it has many sides there aretwo ways to draw this and we have madetwo separate videos for each make sureyou watch them What is a Frequency Polygon?
