I 'm now going to introduce an ancient method for generatinga list of primes up to some limitN called the Sieve of Eratosthenes.Now , Eratosthenes was born in 276 BC , so this method is over 2,200 years old , but it 's very simple and elegant , and you could teach it to any child.Now let 's say , for example , we wantto calculate all the primes up to 100.But this would work in the same wayif we wanted to calculate up to 10,000 or a billion.It proceeds as follows.Assume all numbers are unmarked.Gray is unmarked.We start at the beginning , and if wefind a number that is unmarked , we know it 's prime.So we hit 2 , and we say 2 is prime because it 's unmarked.And then the second phase is now wecan eliminate all multiples of 2 , because we know they 're composite.So bam , we jump along and we eliminate all multiples of 2.Red means composite.And now we repeat.We step along from 2 to 3.3 is unmarked , so we mark 3 as prime.And now we can eliminate all multiples of 3.And a really simple optimization isnotice 6 is already crossed off.We actually cross off the multiplesstarting at the square of that number.So 3 times 3 is 9.We start at 9 and mark all multiples of 3 as composite.And again , we go back.We jump along to 4.Well , 4 is marked , we know it 's composite , and we jump along to 5.We found an unmarked number.5 is prime.Now , 5 times 5 is 25.We go to 25 , we mark off 25 , 30 , 35 , 40 , 45 , and so on.Those are composites.We proceed forward until we hit 7.We know 7 is prime because it 's unmarked.7 times 7 is 49.We mark 49 and all multiples of 7 above it as composite.And now we move along until we hit 11.11 is prime.And notice now , 11 times 11 is greater than 100 , so we can actually stop at this point.We could have stopped at 10 even , because now all remaining unmarked numbers , if you 'll notice , are prime.And we could in one swoop mark them all as prime.And that 's the whole algorithm.It 's so simple.And just to generalize how we do this , so we could write upa program to perform this sieve , isif we want to find all primes up to some number N , we first create a main loop.So we have 4 , all numbers a from 2 to the square root of n.So notice here we stopped.When we hit 10 , or I showed it as 11 , we actually stop because we have found all primes.So from 2 to the square root of N , we proceed as follows.If a is unmarked , then we know a is prime , and when we find a prime number , wemark all multiples of a off as composite.And that 's it.So you find a number prime , mark off the multiples , go back to the beginning , increment a by one.So we 're on 2 , then we go to 3 , then we go to 4 , 5 , and so on.And when we 're done , we have all primes.Notice here that this is also a loop.So we have a main loop 4 , and when we find a prime , this marking off of multiples is also a loop.So it 's important to notice here that we have a nested loop.We have a loop inside a loop.Here is an example of this algorithm in action -- I wrote in JavaScript below -- if I put in 100 , hereare all the primes under 100.And if I put in 200 , here are all the primes under 200.And if I put in 850 , here are all the primes under 850.And below , I have this program with a recording explaininghow I set it up . test
