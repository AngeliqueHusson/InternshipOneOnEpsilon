sometimes when working with equationsyou can come across some veryinteresting examples one of thoseinteresting examples is when you'resolving an equation and it happens notto have a solution whatsoever we'regoing to cover a linear equation whichis just one of those cases so looking atmy linear equation usually it 's notobvious whether these things have asolution or not when we get to thesolving process you 'll see exactly whathappens so I 'm gon na solve this like Iwould normally solve a linear equationI 'm gon na work to get my X 's togetherand then isolate it I can see that maybeI can distribute this ten and maybecombine the four and the negative eighton the end let 's see how this helps meon it so ten X plus 10 minus 2x equals 8X plus 2 times a negative 4 ok lookingpretty good I can see a few terms inthere that will go ahead and combinelike maybe this 10x and this minus 2 soit 'll give us 10 plus 8x and here I have8x minus 8 all right now if you'relooking at what we have a you might geta heads up as to what will happennormally I need to get my X 's togetherand so I 'd subtract an 8x from bothsides when I do that here somethinginteresting happenssince both sides have an 8x it'scompletely gone now when you eliminateall of the variables like that youshould get a clue that something fishyis going on since I 've eliminated my X'sthis final statement gives me a lot ofinformation about my solutions when Ilook at it 10 equals negative 8 I cansee that it 's a completely falsestatement 10 is definitely not equal tonegative 8and if I double-check the steps thatI 've gone through you know I haven'tmade any mistakes so in cases where youdrop out the variables entirely andyou 're left with a false statement thisis your clue that you have no solutionsto the linear equation another thingthat you could call this equation is youcould call it a contradiction it meansthat no matter what value you plug infor X this equation will never be trueso be on the watch out for those falsestatements to come up if they do checkyour work first and if it all looks finethen you know you have no solution test
