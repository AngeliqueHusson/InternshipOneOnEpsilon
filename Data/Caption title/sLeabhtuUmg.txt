hi welcome to math antics this video isall about dividing fractions but inorder to understand how dividingfractions works we first need to learnabout something called reciprocals areciprocal is just a fancy math term forwhat you get when you switch the top andbottom numbers of a fraction for exampleif you have the fraction one over twoand then switch the top and bottomnumbers you 'll end up with two over onetwo over one is the reciprocal of 1 over2 and 1 over 2 is the reciprocal of 2over 1 and an interesting thing aboutreciprocals is multiplying a fraction byits own reciprocal will always give youone that 's because you 'll have the samemultiplication problem on the top andbottom so you 'll end up with a wholefraction which is always 1 ok that'snice but what do reciprocals have to dowith dividing fractionswell reciprocals let us do a really cooltrick that makes dividing fractions easywhenever you have to divide something bya fraction you can just multiply it bythe reciprocal of that fraction insteadand you 'll get the correct answer andthat 's great news because multiplyingfractions is so simple this trick ofmultiplying by the reciprocal worksbecause fractions are really just manydivision problems so when you multiplysomething by 1 over 2 it 's the same asdividing by 2 since 2 is below thefractions division line and dividing by2 is the same as dividing by 2 over 1because you can turn any number into afraction by just writing a 1 as thebottom number right but look reciprocalsthat 's why multiplying by 1 over 2 isthe same as dividing by 2 over 1 andit 's true the other way around too soreally it 's kind of like you never haveto divide fractions you can just rewriteyour division problems so that you'remultiplying by the reciprocal insteadthen when you multiply you 'll get theanswer for the original division problemas always let 's see a couple examples ofhow this worksso you 'll really understand let 's trythis problem 3 over 4 divided by 2 over7 ok so the first thing we want to dois rewrite our problem instead ofdividing by two over seven we canmultiply by the reciprocal instead thereciprocal of 2 over 7 is 7 over 2 soour problem becomes 3 over 4 times 7over 2 oh I should mention a mistakethat a lot of students make when theyfirst learn to divide fractionssometimes students take the reciprocalof the first fraction the one that'sbeing divided or even the reciprocal ofboth fractions but you only want to takethe reciprocal of the second fractionthe one you 're dividing by okay now thatour problem has been changed tomultiplication it 's easy just multiplythe tops 3 times 7 equals 21 andmultiply the bottoms 4 times 2 equals 8and we have the answer to our fractiondivision problem so 3 over 4 divided by2 over 7 is 21 over 8 so that 's prettyeasy but let 's try one more examplelet 's try 15 over 16 divided by 9 over22 again the first thing we want to dois rewrite our problem will change thedivided by 9 over 22 into times 22 over9 now all we have to do is multiply butsince these numbers are kind of big I'mgonna use my calculator to help let'ssee hereso we have alright on the top we have 15times 22 evils 330 and on the bottom wehave 16 times 9 equals 144 so the answerto our division problem is 330 over 144of course that could be simplified foryour final answer on a test but we coversimplifying fractions in another videoall rightthat 's how you divide fractions you justmultiply by the reciprocal and you haveyour answer but there 's one more thing Iwant to show you you already know thatthe line between the top and bottomnumber of a fraction is just anotherform of the division symbol well thatmeans you 'll sometimes see fractiondivision problems written like thisthis shows the top fraction 2 over 3being divided by the bottom fraction 4over 5 it 's really just that we have afraction made up from other fractionsthe top number is a fraction and thebottom number is a fraction it justlooks a little confusing because weall these friction lines here but we canmake it look a lot better let 's rewritethis as a multiplication problem bytaking the reciprocal of the bottomnumber the fraction that we 're dividingby and multiplying it by the fraction ontop there that looks easier to do andit 's really the same problem we justneed to multiply to get the answer so 2times 5 equals 10 and 3 times 4 equals12okay so there you have it what soundedreally hard turns out to be as easy asflipping fractions upside down if youcan multiply fractions then you candivide fractions too do n't forget topractice what you 've learned by doingthe exercises for this section thanksfor watching and I 'll see you next timelearn more at math antics calm
