We already know what Real numbers are.These are the numbers that can be represented on the number line.We also know that Real numbers can be broadly classified , as Rational and Irrational numbers.Rational numbers are those that can be representedas ratio of two integers with no common factor.Irrational numbers on the other handcannot be expressed as ratio of two integers , and when expressed in decimal notationthey are non-terminating , non-recurring decimals.Are there any other kinds of numbers ? Numbers that we have n't looked at yet.Before you answer that question , let me ask you another one.Can you think of a numberwhich when squared results in a negative number ? Yes , a number which when multiplied with itselfgives a negative number.Try it ! You 'd have probably tried a few options . ' 3 times 3 ' is 9 positive . 'Negative 5 times negative 5 ' is 25 , again positive . 'Negative root 3 times negative root 3 ' is 3 , positive again.No luck , we 'll come back to this . Do n't worry ! So we 've studied quadratic equations in middle school.We know that if x squared minus 9 is equal to 0.X is either equal to 3 or negative 3.Now try to find a solution to x squared plus 1 equal to 0.Not sure , or do you think there 's no solution to this one ? Do n't worry if you could n't get the answer to these two questions.Let 's understand the situation now.Whenever we consider the square of a number say ' x'.The result was always positive , whether the number ' x 'was a positive realnumber or a negative one.We always got a positive result.And we had learned that a negative number did not have a square root.So if we had a number like negative 9we said that it 's square root did not exist.Do you remember that while finding the solution of a quadraticequation using the formula , if the discriminant , ' b squared ' minus ' 4 ac ' was negative.We said that there are no real roots of the quadratic equation.Based on what we had studied earlier ' x squared plus 1 equal to 0'will not have any real roots as the value ofdiscriminant is negative 4.Why did we do this ? What was the problem here ? It 's easy . As the square root of negative 1 did not exist for us , we said that there was no solution for the equation x squared plus 1 equals 0.However , in the 16th Centuryit was a mathematician named Cardanwho first started thinking about solutions of quadratic equationswith negative discriminants.Soon others started to but it was Euler in the 18th century.Who gave the square root of negative 1a symbol ' i ' and called it the unit imaginary number.These were termed so as they were thought to be impossibleand just something we imagined.So ' i ' was assumed to be a number whose square is negative 1.Now you 'll be able to answer the two questions.Can you think of a number which when squared results in a negative number ? Yes , it 's ' i'.If square root of negative 1 is ' i'.What is ' i ' times ' i ' , or ' i ' squared .It is 'root negative 1 ' times 'root negative 1'.That gives us negative 1.There you go , we cut a negative number by squaring a number.And the next question was , can you find a solution to ' x squared plus 1 equal to 0 ? 'The answer is yes ! Transposing one to the right-hand side , we get x squared as negative 1.Taking the square root on both sides , we get the value of x , as root of negative 1or minus root of Negative 1.That is plus minus ' i'.So what we learnt in school was n't incorrect.This equation has no real roots.Yes , it has imaginary roots.That 's the concept of imaginary numbers for you ! But wait , we understood the concept of square root of negative one.What if the number is square root of negative seven , or square root of negative nine ? That 's what we will cover in the next video . test
