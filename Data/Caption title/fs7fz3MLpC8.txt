Determine whether the statement is always , sometimes , or never true , and explain why.The statement here is b squared plus b minus 2 , all ofthat over b plus 2 is equal to b minus 1 for allreal numbers b.Well one thing that just jumps out at you before you even tryto manipulate this algebraically is that I canthink of a b value where this left expression wo n't be equalto b minus 1.A b value that will make this left expression undefined.And it becomes undefined if this denominator becomes 0.And the way the denominator is going to become 0 is if b isnegative 2.So let 's write that down.If b is equal to negative 2 , then b squared plus b minus 2over b plus 2 , what does that become ? It equals -- b squared would be 4 minus 2 minus 2 , which wouldbe 0/0 , which is undefined.It 's not equal to -- let me write this this way.It 's not equal to b minus 1 , which is -- negative 2 minus 1 , negative 3.When you put negative 2 in here , on the left-hand side , it does n't evaluate to negative 3.It evaluates to 0/0 , which is undefined.So we already found an example of a b where this is not true.So it 's definitely not always going to be true.We found a case.Now , let 's algebraically manipulate this and see ifit 's true for pretty much any other number.So let 's see if we can maybe factor the numerator up there.So b squared plus b minus 2.If you think about it , two numbers when you take theirproduct is negative 2 , and when you add them you get 1.Well , that 's going to be positive 2 and negative 1.So the numerator we can rewrite as b plus 2times b minus 1.And then the denominator is b plus 2.Well we can just leave it like that.Let 's just work on the left-hand side.Now , if we assume that b is not equal to negative 2 , thenb plus 2 divided by b plus 2 is well defined.It is 1.As long as it 's not 0/0 it will be 1.And so this expression is the same thing as b minus 1 if weassume that b is not equal to negative 2.So if you assume that b is not equal to negative 2 , thisthing over here does indeed equal b minus 1.So it is true for all of the other real numbers except fornegative 2.So this is sometimes true.It 's true every time except for the case where b is equalto negative 2.And you can even try it with some number here.Try it with 0.If I were to do 0 squared plus 0 minus 2 , you get negative 2.Over 0 plus 2 is 2.And then that does indeed equal negative 1.So it works with 0 , it works with 1.It 'll work with any number other than b is equal tonegative 2 . test
