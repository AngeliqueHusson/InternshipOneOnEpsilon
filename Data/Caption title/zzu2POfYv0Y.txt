How does the difference betweenpoint 0000000398 andpoint 00000000398cause one to have red eyes after swimming ? To answer this , we first need a way ofdealing with rather small numbers , or in some cases extremely large numbers.This leads us to the concept of logarithms.Well , what are logarithms ? Let 's take the base number , b , and raise it to a power , p , like 2 to the 3rd power , and have it equal a number n.We get an exponential equation : b raised to the p power , equals n.In our example , that 'd be 2 raisedto the 3rd power , equals 8.The exponent p is said to bethe logarithm of the number n.Most of the time this would be written : '' log , base b , of a number equals p , the power . `` This is starting to sound a bit confusing with all the variables , so let 's show this with an example.What is the value oflog base 10 of 10,000 ? The same question could be asked using exponents : '' 10 raised to what power is 10,000 ? `` Well , 10 to the 4th is 10,000.So , log base 10 of 10,000must equal 4.This example can also be completed very simply on a scientific calculator.Log base 10 is used so frequentlyin the sciencesthat it has the honor of having its own button on most calculators.If the calculator will figure out logs for me , why study them ? Just a quick reminder : the log button only computes logarithms of base 10.What if you want to go into computer scienceand need to understand base 2 ? So what is log base 2 of 64 ? In other words , 2 raised to what power is 64 ? Well , use your fingers . 2 , 4 , 8 , 16 , 32 , 64.So log base 2 of 64 must equal 6.So what does this have to do with my eyes turning redin some swimming poolsand not others ? Well , it leads us into an interestinguse of logarithms in chemistry : finding the pH of water samples.pH tells us how acidic or basic a sample is , and can be calculated with the formula : pH equals negative log base 10 of the hydrogen ion concentration , or H plus.We can find the pH of water sampleswith hydrogen ion concentration of point 0000000398and point 00000000398quickly on a calculator.Punch : negative log of each of those numbers , and you 'll see the pH 's are 7.4 and 8.4.Since the tears in our eyes have a pH of about 7.4 , the H plus concentration of .0000000398will feel nice on your eyes , but the pH of 8.4 will make you feel itchy and red.It 's easy to remember logarithms '' log base b of some number n equals p '' by repeating : `` The base raised to what power equals the number ? `` `` The BASE raised to what POWER equals the NUMBER ? `` So now we know logarithms are very powerfulwhen dealing with extremely small or large numbers.Logarithms can even be usedinstead of eyedrops after swimming .
