hey everyone welcome back thank joining lesson going explore right rectangular prism find volume involved ready welcome back gon na start lesson finding volume rectangular prism familiar get azon package mail box right rectangular prism going think figure term volume volume rectangular prism going dependent word length width height example let consider rectangular prism length inch es width height inch es basic understanding volume figure measure amount space inside figure much hold inside may also know geometry express volume cubic word volume represent unit would take fill entire prism since length width height prism shown measured inch es unit cube length inch width inch height inch take rectangular prism completely fill bottom top one inch unit cube sand count total number final total would represent volume figure counting every single one would take long time efficient way find volume luckily tank prism allow us apply general rule finding volume going explore rule imagine use one inch unit fill bottom layer rectangular prism fill bottom layer would need ten along length width basically would four row ten one inch figure total number unit cover bottom layer multiply ten times four product bottom layer rectangular prism many would take fill entire prism look height inch es mean would need seven multiplying times product represent total number would take fill entire prism conclude prism volume inch cubic inch es let go back thinking apply finding volume rectangular prism last example found volume number layer multiplying value height figure find number base layer found area base case length times width times multiply height conclude define volume rectangular prism multiplying area base height ha ha cool thinking volume way help us better understand familiar formula de fining volume rectangular prism length times width times height case length times width moving forward understand use either formula volume rectangular prism go ahead try another example finding volume rectangular prism case want figure many one unit would take fill figure bottom let go ahead use length times width times height approach example length width two centimeter height next step substitute value equation multiply product length width represent area base height product represent sour volume centimeter cube sand visualize five base bottom top let take understanding volume next level example instead volume one centimeter wan ted express unit since smaller unit see going take several smaller centimeter unit fill entire rectangular prism since dimension half size divide length width height two double amount length double amount width double amount height sure understand volume change amount space inside rectangular figure still however since fill inside space volume alar ger number however unit smaller find volume figure term inch use approach formula volume times width times height substituting length width substituting height multiply case times area volume figure expressed centimeter let go ahead take one last look difference two different measurement use express volume rectangular prism use one centimeter term one figure volume centimeter volume comparison see one centimeter cube equivalent compare volume one centimeter volume multiply result relationship able better understand express volume figure volume dependent unit choose use let go ahead take one final example want find many inch fit inside prism shown notice prism cal led fractional mean dimension length width height mixed include fraction case unit one quarter inch imagine one inch cube cube course inch cube small volume much used inch even though two include fraction still use approach finding volume length times width times height formula first let look length figure one half inch es think one inch unit cube alongside half one inch unit cube next question would equivalent one quarter inch unit think term money quarter inch unit cube would like quarter one half inch measurement would like dollar fifty half six quarters replace measurement inch es one quarter inch case inch length since width one inch know would take inch cover say width term quarter inch apply thought process height inch would equivalent inch replace height find volume multiply volume conclude would take fill entire prism keep strategi es concept mind continue explore right rectangular term
