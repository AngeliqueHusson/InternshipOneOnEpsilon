consider line segment b given line l perpendicular bisector segment b aright angle two sides equal prove perpendicular bisector theorem say every point perpendicular bisector equidistant blet zoom write whats given us given perpendicular segment b point c b p point line land prove p equal prove proof simple two case forget consider let case one point p segment b know point p line l given us mean point p point b c coincide write p also know c equidistant point b since line l perpendicular bisector c equal b c point p c write p equal proved result first case let zoom look case case two kind p c coincide point p somewhere line l point c say mark prove distance equal distance remember whenever two sides two angle equal look proving two already see try triangle triangle b p c prove two triangle congruent say p equal b p would corresponding sides congruent congruent let see know c equal b c c segment b angle c p equal angle b c p equal p c common side triangle say p c equal p c clearly case side angle side mean triangle congruent triangle b p c condition thats done p equal b p corresponding sides proved every point perpendicular bisector given segment equidistant prove perpendicular bisector theorem prove perpendicular bisector theorem prove perpendicular bisector theorem prove perpendicular bisector theorem prove perpendicular bisector theorem
