possible going find stump right point goes one infinity inside interest engine earn insert engine plus inside kind input l appreciate know going situation usual style thats right two alright let see going use formula world written us already theres much algebra going plug n equal indicate n equal plugging one want hear right first current inverse tangent one inverse tangent plus first term n equal well well equal right inclusion inverse tangent minus inverse tangent like right let put one plus equal inverse tangent minus inverse tangent plus put plus da plus thats put full armor end current inverse tangent n minus inverse tangent n plus going forever right see guy see nowheres best part cancellation part one stays interest engine right one right away right sha ring cancel right away know going concerned right something front going cancel right cancel cancel whats said actual number one net right reason one expect one turn left actual number wise therefore going inverse tangent one right actual number wise however must put well take consideration right ill put blue right thats inverse tangent n plus one like one part see happen n goes infinity take limit right first one inverse tangent know calculate right ask tension apply ing go give pi tangent pi give right right n goes infinity infinity plus infinity inverse tangent infinity know horizontal though limit pi right going give us pi right thats minus see dealing finite value course work right let go ahead multiply see pi pi negative pi denominator negative pi like therefore right converge converge negative pi image ready standing guy right converge sand find pole convergence right negative pi possible enter negative value fact turns figure previous term right keep negative value along infinitely many times thats answer thats sum series series series series series series series series series series series series series series series series series series series series series series series series series series series series series series series series series series series series series series series series series series series series series series series series series series series series series series series series series series series series series series series series series series series series series series series series series
