Now let 's start to do some more interesting problems.And one of these things that you 'll find in probabilityis that you can always do a more interesting problem.So now I 'm going to think about -- I'mgoing to take a fair coin , and I'mgoing to flip it three times.And I want to find the probability of at leastone head out of the three flips.So the easiest way to think about thisis how many equally likely possibilities there are.In the last video , we saw if we flip a coin 3 times , there 's 8 possibilities.For the first flip , there 's 2 possibilities.Second flip , there's 2 possibilities.And in the third flip , there are 2 possibilities.So 2 times 2 times 2 -- there are 8 equally likely possibilitiesif I 'm flipping a coin 3 times.Now how many of those possibilitieshave at least 1 head ? Well , we drew all the possibilities over here.So we just have to count how many of thesehave at least 1 head.So that 's 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7.So 7 of these have at least 1 head in them.And this last one does not.So 7 of the 8 have at least 1 head.Now you 're probably thinking , OK , Sal.You were able to do it by writing outall of the possibilities.But that would be really hard if Isaid at least one head out of 20 flips.This had worked well because I only had 3 flips.Let me make it clear , this is in 3 flips . This would have been a lot harderto do or more time consuming to do if I had 20 flips.Is there some shortcut here ? Is there some other way to think about it ? And you could n't just do it in some simple way.You ca n't just say , oh , the probabilityof heads times the probability of heads , because if you gotheads the first time , then now youdo n't have to get heads anymore.Or you could get heads again -- you do n't have to.So it becomes a little bit more complicated.But there is an easy way to think about it whereyou could use this methodology right over here.You 'll actually see this on a lot of examswhere they make it seem like a harder problem , but if you just think about in the right way , all of a suddenit becomes simpler.One way to think about it is the probability of at least1 head in 3 flips is the same thing -- this is the same thing -- as the probability of notgetting all tails , right ? If we got all tails , then we do n't have at least 1 head.So these two things are equivalent.The probability of getting at least 1 head in 3 flipsis the same thing as the probabilityof not getting all tails in 3 flips . So what 's the probability of not getting all tails ? Well , that 's going to be 1 minus the probability of gettingall tails.The probability of getting all tails , since it 's 3flips , it 's the probability of tails , tails , and tails.Because any of the other situationsare going to have at least 1 head in them.And that 's all of the other possibilities , and then this is the only other leftover possibility.If you add them together , you 're going to get 1.Let me write it this way.Let me write it a new color just so yousee where this is coming from.The probability of not all tails plus the probabilityof all tails -- well , this is essentially exhaustive.This is all of the possible circumstances.So your chances of getting either not all tailsor all tails -- and these are mutually exclusive , so we can add them.The probability of not all tails or , just to be clearwhat we 're doing , the probability of not all tailsor the probability of all tails is going to be equal to one.These are mutually exclusive.You 're either going to have not all tails , whichmeans a head shows up.Or you 're going to have all tails.But you ca n't have both of these things happening.And since they're mutually exclusiveand you 're saying the probability of thisor this happening , you could add their probabilities.And this is essentially all of the possible events.So this is essentially , if you combine these , this is the probability of any of the events happening.And that 's going to be a 1 or 100 % chance.So another way to think about is the probabilityof not all tails is going to be 1minus the probability of all tails.So that 's what we did right over here.And the probability of all tails is pretty straightforward.That 's the probability of it 's goingto be 1/2 , because you have a 1/2 chance of gettinga tails on the first flip , times -- let me write it here , so we can have it a little clearer.So this is going to be 1 minus the probability of gettingall tails.You will have a 1/2 chance of getting tailson the first flip , and then you'regoing to have to get another tails on the second flip , and then you're going to have to getanother tails on the third flip.And then 1/2 times 1/2 times 1/2.This is going to be 1/8.And then 1 minus 1/8 or 8/8 minus 1/8is going to be equal to 7/8.So we can apply that to a problem that is harderto do than writing all of the scenarioslike we did in the first problem . Let 's say we have 10 flips , the probability of at least onehead in 10 flips -- well , we use the same idea.This is going to be equal to the probability of notall tails in 10 flips . So we 're just saying the probabilityof not getting all of the flips going to be tail.All of the flips is tails -- not all tails in 10 flips.And this is going to be 1 minus the probability of flippingtails 10 times.So it 's 1 minus 10 tails in a row . And so this is going to be equal to this part right over here.Let me write this.So this is going to be this one.Let me just rewrite it.This is equal to 1 minus -- and this part is going to be , well , one tail , another tail.So it 's 1/2 times 1/2.And I 'm going to do this 10 times . Let me write this a little neater.1/2 -- so that 's 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , and 10.And so we really just have to -- the numerator is going to be 1.So this is going to be 1.This is going to be equal to 1.Let me do it in that same color of green.This is going to be equal to 1 minus -- our numerator , you just have 1 times itself 10 times.So that 's 1.And then on the denominator , you have 2 times 2 is 4.4 times 2 is 8 , 16 , 32 , 64 , 128 , 256 , 512 , 1,024 -- over 1,024.This is the exact same thing as 1 is 1024 over 1024 minus 1over 1024 , which is equal to 1,023 over 1,024.We have a common denominator here.So 1,000 -- I 'm doing that same blue -- over 1,024.So if you flip a coin 10 times in a row -- a fair coin -- you 're probability of getting at least 1 headsin that 10 flips is pretty high.It 's 1,023 over 1,024.And you can get a calculator out to figure that outin terms of a percentage.Actually , let me just do that just for fun.So if we have 1,023 divided by 1,024 that gives us -- youhave a 99.9 % chance that you 're goingto have at least one heads.So this is if we round.This is equal to 99.9 % chance.And I rounded a little bit.It 's actually slightly , even slightly , higher than that.And this is a pretty powerful tool or a pretty powerful wayto think about it because it would have taken youforever to write all of the scenarios down.In fact , there would have been 1,024 scenarios to write down.So doing this exercise for 10 flipswould have taken up all of our time.But when you think about in a slightly different way , whenyou just say , look the probability of getting at least1 heads in 10 flips is the same thingas the probably of not getting all tails.And that 's 1 minus the probabilityof getting all tails.And this is actually a pretty easy thing to think about .
