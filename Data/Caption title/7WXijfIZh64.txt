told part experiment train different train conductor measured distance covered certain amount time recent journey long took go many use different time see guy half hour guy hour sand difficult time data according data provided speed experiment figure speed train based far went amount time remind us might already know know distance equal rate times time divide sides equation bytime could divide sides time times cancel get rate equal distance divided thing speed make sense distance divided time hear per hour meter per second per hour rate speed distance divided use divide distance time train figure speed let let write speed si make another column speed right first guy went let divide distance train went divide something thing times way times times per hour speed per hour guy pretty straightforward went exactly hour distance divided time guy pretty straightforward also put distance time per hour guy went see went let figure little bit decimal long division goes multiply essentially shift decimal one shift decimal becomes goes many times n go goes five times carry times plus minus right bring goes five times times remainder hour half per hour finally divided indeed go move speed experiment basic rate problem linear equation algebra khan academy basic rate problem linear equation algebra khan academy basic rate problem linear equation algebra khan academy basic rate problem linear equation algebra khan academy basic rate problem linear equation algebra khan academy
