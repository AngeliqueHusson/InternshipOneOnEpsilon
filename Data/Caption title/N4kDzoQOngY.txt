100 is what percent of 80 ? These problems tend to kill people because on some levelthey 're kind of simple , they're just 100 and an 80there , and they 're asking what percent.But then people get confused.They say , do I divide the 100 by the 80 ? The 80 by 100 ? Or is it something else going on ? And you really just have to think through what thelanguage is saying.They 're saying that this value right here , this 100 , is somepercentage of 80 , and that some percentage is what wehave to figure out.What percent ? So if we multiply 80 by this what percent , we will get 100.So let 's view it this way.We have 80.If we multiply it by something , let 's call thissomething x.Let me do that in a different color.If we multiply 80 by something , we aregoing to get 100.And we need to figure out what we need to multiply80 by to get 100.And if we just solve this equation as it is , we 're goingto get a value for x.And what we need to do is then convert it to a percent.Another way you could have viewed this is 100 is what youget when you multiply what by 80 ? And then you would have gotten this number , and then youcould convert it to a percent.So this is essentially the equation and nowwe can solve it.If we divide both sides of this equation by 80 , so youdivide the left-hand side by 80 , the right-hand sideby 80 , you get x.x is equal to 100/80.They both share a common factor of 20 , so 100 dividedby 20 is 5 , and 80 divided by 20 is 4.So in simplest form , x is equal to 5/4 , but I 've onlyexpressed it as a fraction.But they want to know what percent of 80.If they just said 100 is what fraction of80 , we would be done.We could say 100 is 5/4 of 80 , and we wouldbe absolutely correct.But they want to say what percent ? So we have to convert this to a percent , and the easiestthing to do is to first convert it into a decimal , solet 's do that.5/4 is literally the same thing as 5 divided by 4 , solet 's figure out what that is.Let me do it in magenta.So 5 divided by 4.You want to have all the decimals there , so let 's putsome zeroes out here.4 goes into 5 one time.Let me switch up the colors.1 times 4 is 4.You subtract.You get 5 minus 4 is 1.Bring down the next zero.And of course , the decimal is sitting right here , so we wantto put it right over there.So you bring down the next zero.4 goes into 10 two times.2 times 4 is 8.You subtract.10 minus 8 is 2.Bring down the next zero.4 goes into 20 five times.5 times 4 is 20.Subtract.No remainder.So this is equal to 1.25.5/4 is the same thing as 5 divided by 4 , which is equal to 1.25.So far , we could say , 100 is 1.25 times 80 , or 1.25 of 80 , you could even say , But we still have n't expressed it asa percentage.This is really just as a number.I guess you could call it a decimal , but it 's a wholenumber and a decimal.It would be a mixed number if we did n't do it as a decimal.It 's 1 and 1/4 , or 1 and 25 hundredths , however you wantto read it.So to write it as a percent , you literally just have tomultiply this times 100 , or shift the decimal over twice.So this is going to be equal to , as a percent , if you justshift the decimal over twice , this is equal to 125 % .And that makes complete sense.100 is 125 % of 80.80 is 100 % of 80.100 % percent is more than 80.It 's actually 1 and 1/4 of 80 , and you see that right overthere , so it makes sense.It 's 125 % .It 's more than 100 % .But we are done.We 've solved the problem.It is a 125 % of 80 .
