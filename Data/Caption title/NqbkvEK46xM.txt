A thermometer in a science lab displays the temperaturein both Celsius and Fahrenheit.If the mercury in the thermometerrises to 56 degrees Fahrenheit -- they'regiving us the Fahrenheit temperature -- what is the corresponding Celsius temperature ? And then they give us the two formulas , that if we know the Celsius temperature , how do we figure out the Fahrenheit temperature , or if we know the Fahrenheit temperature , how do we figure out the Celsius temperature.And these are actually derived from each other , and you 'll learn more about that when you do algebra.And we also -- maybe in another video -- will explain how to derive these.It 's actually kind of interesting , involves a little bit of algebra.But they gave us the formula.So they really just want us to apply it , and maybe make surewe understand which one we should apply.Well , they 're giving us the Fahrenheit temperatureright here , so F is going to be equal to 56.And they 're asking us for the Celsius temperature , so we need to figure out what the Celsius temperature is.Well , in this one over here , if you know the Fahrenheittemperature , then you can solve for the Celsius temperature.So let 's use this right over here.So our Celsius temperature is goingto be 5/9 times the Fahrenheit temperature -- the Fahrenheittemperature is 56 degrees Fahrenheit -- minus 32.Well , 56 minus 32 is 24.So this is going to be equal to 5/9 times 24.And this is the same thing as 5 times 24 , over 9.And before I even multiply out 5 times 24 , we can divide the numerator and the denominator by 3.So let 's do that.If we divide the numerator by 3 and the denominator , we 're not changing the value.24 divided by 3 is 8.9 divided by 3 is 3.So it becomes 5 times 8 , which is 40 , over 3 degrees.And if we want to write this as a number thatmakes a little bit more sense in terms of temperature , let 's divide 3 into 40 to get the number of degrees we have.3 goes into 4 one time.1 times 3 is 3.Subtract.4 minus 3 is 1.Bring down the 0.3 goes into 10 three times.3 times 3 is 9.Subtract.Get a 1.And then you could bring down another 0.We now have a decimal point over here.You 're going to get a 0 here.3 goes into , once again , 10 three times.And this 3 is going to repeat forever.So you could view this -- this is equal to 13.333 -- it 'll just keep repeating.This little line on top means repeating -- degrees Celsius.Or you could say that , look , 3 goes into 40 13 timeswith a remainder of 1.So you could say that this is also equal to 13 , remainder 1.So 13 and 1/3 degrees Celsius.Either way , it works.But that 's our Celsius temperaturewhen our Fahrenheit temperature is 56 degrees .
