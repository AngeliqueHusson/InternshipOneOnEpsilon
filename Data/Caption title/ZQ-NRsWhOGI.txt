quick three step process factor quadratic thats actually factorable first thing given quadratic equation factor something common term take first gon na make life easier look whats left left x squared plus something x plus something bear x squared um show n already know may left something front x squared like negative squared plus something x plus something case use little bit complicated method gon na show use decomposition maybe familiar another method people use box people use bunch trick use whatever want going show use decomposition anyone k let follow process different thing first one want x squared minus minus common factor among term x squared minus minus x anything nothing pull nothing common next bear x squared yes x squared minus minus second step find two multiply negative add negative soon find plug right well let figure multiply negative add negative well negative multiply add positive good negative add good give negative multiply negative add toa negative look two negative add negative negative actually easy soon find two someone done got rid x squared split two separate term one start beginning common factor among nothing common among bear x squared yeah gon na use thing cal led decomposition first thing find two multiply times way new search different old search negative want multiply negative add negative would thing two multiply negative add negative obviously negative already found something front x squared bit way write laugh first term last term negative x squared minus term two negative minus plus see negative negative divided decomposed get get factor first two common well much except x pull x left minus took away one x factor second two whats common nothing really nothing n able pull anything left minus term pull left well pull minus left x pull left plus form equation little decompose middle term factor first two second couple common factor among term yes common five divisible five x pull x term pull left single x pull left pul led x divided us oh look x squared left easy finally let one common factor among term x squared minus x plus n know well let see know could pull pull x squared obviously left x squared pull negative x left negative x pull positive left like bear x squared yes remove already x squared minus x plus factor bear x squared use product sum need multiply add negative number front x well got start multiply n add negative though let cross way negative negative dont work multiply dont add negative negative negative n want n add negative either n add negative negative yeah n add negative multiply ah n add negative well negative negative also n multiply negative know exhausted pair multiply ca n got lookout know sometimes ca n factor thing bold statement like ca n probably run like pair multiply single pair negative one mean cant factor three step process follow able factor anything want music factor quadratic equation factor quadratic equation factor quadratic equation factor quadratic equation factor quadratic equation factor quadratic equation factor quadratic equation factor quadratic equation factor quadratic equation factor quadratic equation factor quadratic equation factor quadratic equation factor quadratic equation factor quadratic equation factor quadratic equation factor quadratic equation factor quadratic equation factor quadratic equation factor quadratic equation factor quadratic equation
