quick three step process factor quadratic thats actually factorable first thing given quadratic equation factor theres something common term take first gon na make life easier look whats left left x squared plus something x plus something bear x squared um ill show dont already know may left something front x squared like negative squared plus something x plus something thats case use little bit complicated method gon na show use decomposition maybe familiar another method people use box people use bunch trick use whatever want going show use decomposition anyone k let follow process different thing first one want x squared minus minus common factor among term x squared minus minus x theres anything theres nothing pull theres nothing common next bear x squared yes x squared minus minus second step find two multiply negative add negative soon find plug right well let figure multiply negative add negative well negative multiply add positive thats good negative add thats good give negative multiply negative add toa negative look two negative add negative negative actually easy soon find two someone done got rid x squared weve split two separate term weve one start beginning common factor among nothing common among bear x squared yeah gon na use thing cal led decomposition first thing find two multiply times way new search different old search negative want multiply negative add negative would thing two multiply negative add negative obviously negative already found something front x squared bit way write laugh first term last term negative x squared minus term two negative minus plus see negative negative weve divided weve decomposed get get factor first two common well much except x pull x left minus took away one x factor second two whats common nothing really nothing werent able pull anything left minus term pull left well pull minus left x pull left plus thats form equation little decompose middle term factor first two second couple common factor among term yes theres common five divisible five theres x pull x term pull left single x pull left pul led x divided us oh look theres x squared left easy finally let one common factor among term x squared minus x plus dont know well let see know could pull pull x squared obviously left x squared pull negative x left negative x pull positive left like bear x squared yes remove already x squared minus x plus factor bear x squared use product sum need multiply add negative thats number front x well got start multiply dont add negative though thats let cross way negative negative dont work multiply dont add negative negative negative dont want dont add negative either dont add negative negative yeah dont add negative multiply ah doesnt add negative well negative negative also doesnt multiply negative know exhausted pair multiply cant got lookout know sometimes cant factor thing bold statement like cant probably run like pair multiply single pair negative one mean cant factor three step process follow able factor anything factor quadratic equation factor quadratic equation factor quadratic equation factor quadratic equation factor quadratic equation factor quadratic equation factor quadratic equation factor quadratic equation factor quadratic equation factor quadratic equation factor quadratic equation factor quadratic equation factor quadratic equation factor quadratic equation factor quadratic equation factor quadratic equation factor quadratic equation factor quadratic equation
