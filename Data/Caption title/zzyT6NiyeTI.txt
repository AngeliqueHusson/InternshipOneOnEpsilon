welcome back to another fun evening withyour geometry teacher and tonight wewill be talking about similarity andmore specifically similar triangles solet 's begin the first place I want tostart with is the reminding you of themathematical definition of similarpolygons and here it goes two polygonsare similar if and only if thecorresponding angles are congruent andthe corresponding sides are proportionaland yes indeedyou need both of those to be true andsimilar like you may recall means inlayman 's terms same shape different sizeall right I 'm going to begin tonightwith a geogebra here and with geogebraI 've got a graph out here and I canstart inputting coordinates and if Ijust hit enterthere goes magically I get a point andthen so I 'll put another point on let'sput a 1 comma 2 and 4 comma 1 so nowI 've got a B C and let 's go ahead andmake a triangle ABC fantastic now youcan see up here I have the coordinatesand below them I have the line segmentsa B and C now what I would like to do ismake a dilation of triangle ABC and adilation is nothing more thanmaintaining the shape of an object butchanging its size sound similar to whatI just said hmm maintaining the shapechanging the size okay soif I have the coordinates one way to dothat is to a well we could do distanceformula the geogebra did it for sincetells me that C is one point four one ifI double it and just carry it on thisway I could I could do that right Icould just draw it from here and gotwice as far this way from B to C twiceit for this way and that would make adilation right now that would keep bepossibly at the same spot and let mejust let me just show you something likethat we could go over and go out thisway somewhere here right and go here I'mguessing right now right boom you getthe idea and I can make it a newtriangle now of course it 'd be easierwith the compass let 's move that it 'd beeasier with a compass to double thesegment things like that but even betterthan that there are some tricks to if Iknow the coordinates I can make adilation simply by taking the points andmultiplying them all by the same factorright and known as a scale factor rightand what I 've done here is I 've takenall the points you see here a is 2 3 B 12 C 4 1 and I 've doubled everything sonow the new point from B instead ofbeing 1 2 is going to be 2 4 and a is 46 and F which is 8 2 which is double ofC and look at the triangle that I'vemade I have made a triangle that indeedlooks very similar now does it makesense to you that it is similar becauseif we recordings nothing we 're how farover and how far up so from point Bright there I went over 1 and up 2 toget to point E I went over to end up forI just maya larger right triangle to get thereright that makes sense so and I did thatto every point so I did just dilate infact a dilation we can write aconjecture for that if one polygon isthe image of another polygon under adilation then the polygons are similarmeaning that because to be a dilationyou maintained the shape but change thesize and we could either go larger orsmaller with the dilation if I multiplyby a scale factor of 1/2 then I 'm makinga smaller shape but make it double ofcourse I 'm making it larger stateokay now let 's specifically talk aboutsimilar triangles now I have twotriangles here this wooden has one oneach side and this one is three on eachsideare these two triangles can similar andof course you would say they are similaryes because both of these are equal atall trunks right so every equilateraltriangle is the same shape and we knowthat every angle on there is 60 degreeseasy enoughwell what about something like this I'vegot two triangles not telling you theangles but you might be able to figureout what kind of angles they aremaintaining a relationship between thesides right from one to the other thisis a from 2 over 3 2 over 3 4 over 6 is2 or 3 Oh every size proportional andthese two triangles are indeed similarthis is the symbol for similar one tildeif you forgotten and yes those are your30-60-90 triangles right all 30-60-90triangles have that relationship of X 2xand X root 3 so all 30-60-90 trianglesare similarwell alright now what if I do n't tellyou the angles you do n't know what theyare we 'll go over this one you may knowwhat they areif it 's just having the sides enough andthe answer of course is yes if I havethe sides that are proportional I'vejust indeed created a dilation it'snothing more than taking that triangleand made it larger or smaller and so yesthey are similar so that leads us to theside-side-side similarity conjecturewhich says that if three sides of onetriangle are proportional to the threesides of another triangle then the twotriangles are similar now let 's move onto knowing other parts if I tell you twoangles of one triangle and two angles ofanother triangle is that enough to saythat these two triangles are similarwell a triangle special because it onlyhas three angles and if it has you knowtwo angles well you know the third angleright and I just got through saying thatevery 30-60-90 triangle it 's similar sothose two definitely are similar rightand likewise if this is 40 and this is80 40 and 80 well whatever it is rightif you can add the leftover pieces haveto be so once again without knowing theside links I know that these twotriangles must be similar nothing morethan a dilation once again and soinstead of saying a conjecture that saysthat we need to all three angles we justsimply say it as a angle angleconjecture this is widely known ingeometry if two angles of one triangleare congruent to 2 angles anothertriangle then the triangles are similarpretty straightforward and that 's agreat one to know I mean that one reallydoes help us outall right now what other combinationscan I give you and the answer is I giveyou aside an angle and a side and hereI 've given you another side and goingside that sounds like one we 've donebefore side-angle-sideis it 's good it 's a congruenceconjecture and these are not congruentof course can you imagine that they mustbe similar well yes if I take this oneand I multiply every side by two andwhat that multiplied with it 's called ascale factor of two if I 'm going thisway and multiplying it to get this andit would be congruent it 's a scalefactor of one half if I 'm going this wayand yes once again if I have two sidesthat are proportional like like a scalefactor right and that the angles inbetween are congruent then it is indeedsimilar now I just said something aboutproportional we have n't really writtenthat out proportional that that meansnothing more than the ratio right I canwrite it as three is compared to fivethat 's a ratio a proportion is our tworatios set equal together and threecompared to five and this would have tobe one and a half compared to two and ahalf and are those equal well yes theyare because if you simplify this one youget that and that 's what proportionalmeans that proportional to two ratio setequal to each otherall right now we 're going to be doing awhole bunch of proportional problems andreviewing this this is all in youralgebra 1 of last year right and youlove it right so I think we we need tomake our side angle side can similaritya conjecture which states that if twosides of one triangle are proportionalto 2 sides of anothertriangle and the included angles arecongruent then the triangles are similarnow I did leave out a congruenceconjecture but angle-angle-side that hastwo angles already so angle angle worksand angle side angle that also has twoangles in it so I do n't need that oneand once again the ones that do n't workfor congruence still do n't work forsimilarity all right I think that willdo it and we will get busy next time Isee okay Similarity Similarity
