So today we 're going to talk aboutPascal 's triangle . It 's one of myfavorite things in math - particularlybecause whenever I talk to othermathematicians they always have someinteresting patterns they like talkingabout . It 's almost never the same one.So Pascal 's triangle is sort of like anaddition triangle . So we start withthe number one and every time I draw oneassume that everything around it is abunch of zeros so what we do is we haveone and then we add whatever is to the leftof it - so it 's neighbor here is 0 and we justdrop that down in between - then I dothe same thing on the right.Alright cool now I have two ones in this rowand I 'll do the same thing sothere 's a 0 we can imagine here so wedrop that down.There 's one in this neighbor now sowe can have a two and then there 's oneand the zero to its right we make another one.And we just keep doing this for a whileand you can see that the triangle justkeeps getting bigger this is nothingthat 's gon na stop . So we can just keepdoing this for as long as we want andfor me as long as I want is when thefirst double-digit number shows upbecause that 's when adding gets hard.So Pascal was also a combinatorist soin particular like problems where `` If I haveN things and I want to choose K ofthem , how many different ways can I dothat ? '' And it turns out that Pascal'striangle is really like `` childlike addinggame '' as seems to be actually encodes Nchoose K. So if I have N things -in particular let 's say i have four thingsand I want to choose let 's say one ofthem then I go to the fourth row I moveover one and that 's how many ways I cando it four ways . I if I have four thingslet 's say I have like four circles andI want to only choose one of them - there arefour ways i can do that right . I canchoose this one , I can choose that oneI can choose that one , I can choose that oneAnd it turns out Pascal 's triangle says if I go down to thefourth row and - where it like this is the0th row - and I choose one thing so I moveone over then that 's exactly how manyways I can do it . ( Brady Haran ) So if i told you to choose two circles-Then there are six ways to do it.You notice that the sides are always onesLike , this is n't going to change becausewe just keep doing 1+0 and then oh , look1 + 0 , 1 plus 0 . And this is just gon na keephappening so we can define this entirediagonal as `` +0 '' because every time Igo down 1 i 'm not changing anythingBut then we get to this row right and we haveone plus one plus one plus one becauseI have 0 1 2 3 4 5 so i can define this rowI felt like it as `` +1 '' then thispattern looks less fun right . I have One , a ThreeBut the difference between three and oneis 2 . The difference between six andthree is three the difference between10 and 6 is 4 so it turns out this pattern is+ 1 + 2 + 3 keeps going . So around hereOne may be tempted to look for morepatterns like right here is like pluswhat three plus six but that 's when youstart to notice what we 've been doingall along which was just adding thenumber to the top-left like Pascalwanted us to anyway . Let 's just look atsomething else one that might be tempted todo when they see a bunch of numbers andthat 's add them in a different way.So this is 1 . One plus 1 is 2 . One plus 2 plus 1 is 4.One plus 3 is 4 plus 3 is 7 plus 1 is 8.You 'll notice that some point I just stopped addingbecause we can actually rewrite everything over here asthe powers of 2 . So the sum of the rows ofPascal 's triangle is two - like if I 'm onthe Nth row and I call the first one row zero thenthe sum of that row is 2 to the N.Let 's just read these as numbers let 's not addthem let 's not treat them as anything elseSo the first row is 1 the next row is 11The next row is a hundred and twenty one . The next row is thirteen thrity-one . Then we getThen we get fourteen six-four-oneAnd then we get to this*laughs*So , right now these are actually the powers of 11 tooSo this next row looks pretty frighteningbecause if I wrote it out justas it is , I get a pretty big number rightlike once I put in these commas , this is around 15 million ( brady ) That 's not 11 to the 5It 's not . But it turns out Pascalyou know his triangle does n't quit that earlyso what 's happening here is thatwhen I was writing these as digitsbefore , I was actually considering thatplace value right - like the ones placethe tens place the hundreds placeSo I 'm just going to do the same thing where I rewrite these numbersas ones and tens and hundreds placeSo the first one will be one times 10 to the 0because this is the 0th rowThen we have 1 times 10 to the 1 plus 1times 10 to the 0 ( 1x10^1+1x10^0 ) so this one 's 1 this one 's 11.Uh , let 's do 1 times 10 squared plus 1 timeste- oh 2 times 10 to the one my bad - plus 1times 10 to 0 . That '' s a hundred twenty-oneSo let 's let 's skip on down to our friend hereWe do 1 times 10 to the 5 Plus 5 10to the 4 plus 10 10 to the 3 plus 10 ( 10 ) squared ? - yeah5 to the 10 to the 1 and 1 times 10 to the 0and this is 11 to the 5 ( Brady ) So it is 11^5It is 11^5 , it 's just hidingSo now I have this really cool thingthat I found extremely recently calledum , the hockey sticks method i thinksome people call it . It 's just a reallycool trick that you can do on Pascal'striangle another result of the fact thatit 's the coefficients of like a binomialexpansion which is all of - it will makemore sense once I draw hockey stickWhat you do is you pick a one somewhere on theedge and you just go down diagonally soi 'm going to pick this one and then i'mgoing to go down diagonally and then I 'm justgonna keep going and then at some pointI 'm just gon na veer off in this case I have toveer off because I did n't draw any morerows . So the number that I veer off tois the sum of all the numbers I traced down1 plus 2 Plus 3 plus 4 equals 10So this row - or this diagonal rather - equals 10So I 'm gon na start with this oneand it 's gon na be awful real quicklyactually I 'm just gon na all right towork on small ones . Uh , let 's use this oneBecause ... why not . We can do the other direction , rightand we get 1 plus two plus three equals 6I 'm gon na do Pascal 's triangle mod 2So , brief aside - mod 2 in this case is justgoing to mean that every time a numberis odd I write it as a one and everytime a number is even I write it as a zero ( Brady ) Coolcool right ( Brady ) That 's still a Pascal Triangle , is that ? Yeah , just mod two . It does n't likepreserve the actual value of the numbersas much , but it totally tells you whetheror not something is even or odd and that'sall we care about right now.So then I 'm going to outline all of thediagonals that are all ones and all therows are all onesSo i 'm going to do this - which is n't the world 's prettiestthing but it 's pretty niceand this shape should maybe start tolook a little familiar if you played - I dunno -legend of zelda before . It 's th-also the Triforcebut more importantly it 's sierpinski 's triangleso for those who do n't recognize sierpinski 's triangleI start with an equilateral triangleI inscribe another one upside down andthen i can just keep doing this on allof the upward facing triangles as manytimes as I wantso yeah that 's can just go on for a long time ( Brady ) Cool , yeah ? And it turns out that theway that the evens and odds show upin Pascal 's triangle when I convert themto mod 2 , I can make Pascal triangle asbig as I want and I 'm just going to keepgetting iterations of sierpinski 's triangleso that 's really cool ( Brady ) That 's awesome ! That 's really cool by itself but it gets cooler using the mod 2 constructionThere 's something else we can do in mod two thoughUm , in particular we can write down the samethings but let 's write them now as - we 've got ones and zeroes , right ? And for most people ones and zeros kinda remind them of binarySo , let 's just see what happens when we transcribe these from binaryYou know one binary - 1 and then 11 in binary is 3101 is 5111 is 15 and then the next one , 10001 is 17Now these may not immediately appear pretty coolbut if I kept going the next one is 51The next one is 85After that is 255 and here I 'm gon na stop and I'mgoing to look at what these numbers arethree is primeFive is prime15 is 5 times 317 is prime51 is 17 times 385 is 17 x 5And 255 is 17 x 15So you 'll notice that every time I get a prime i go back andjust multiply by all the things that came before itand I can generate the next you know n minus 1 entriesSo the primes that we have here actually at least the onesthat I 'm - that we 're certain of - are actually Fermat ( pronounced fer-mat ) primesOr Fermat ( pronounced fer-mot ) primes ratherWhich means that they can be written of the form 2 to the 2 to the n plus 1Somehow every time I talk to a mathematician-even 10 minutes ago when i asked a different mathematician for an ideahe told me something I 've never heard beforeSo even if maybe somewhere out in the world all of the things you coulddo with this triangle are doneI do n't know if there 's any one personwho knows them all and maybe there'sonly one person who knows one of themand we just have to keep exploring thetriangle and seeing if we cancollaboratively explain everythinginside of it but it 's an infinitetriangle right so maybe there are thingson the hundredth line down that wehave n't explored yetI feel like it would n't be a numberphile video if somehowthe Fibonacci sequence did n't show upSo i 'm going to show you where the Fibonacci sequence is in the Pascal 's triangle because ... this is a numberphile videoyeah so what we 're going to do is we'regonna add up the shallow diagonalsSo what that means here is the triangle kind ofinscribed diagonals already right like Icould look at this one and just kind offollow this but a shallow diagonal means thati 'm going to kind of go off at aslightly higher angle that I would haveif I was just following the way I drewthe triangle so for example the firstFibonacci number is one so that 's my shallow diagonalAnd then this one does n't have any other shallow neighborsso it 's just by itself alsoSo now we have one , one.So this shallow diagonal is a one and then this oneSo we do this and you get 2Then we do this one with this two - we get threeWe do this one with this 3 with this one we get fiveAnd you know how this game goesSo we have 1,4 and three here so we 're going to get eightWe get- I 'm goina do one more in case you do n't believe meWe 're going to do five plus six plus one and this one down here that I did n't add yetAnd we get 13 ( Brady ) CoolSo there you have it - the two biggest recurrence relations in math that involve addition probablyum tied together in the TriangleThey 're not unique things you know you can have oneand it encodes the other and it 's alljust related in really beautiful waysit 's so beautiful you know , this triangle has allof these really cool properties about itand again like you said earlier it feelslike it 's really childlike thing rightlike I just you know add the things nextto me and I just plop them down under butI 've been playing with this trianglesince ... I want to say 8th or 9th grade andI learned half of these things in thepast month and there are still otherthings that I could ramble on aboutabout this triangle and this is n't evenmy field like I 'm still an undergraduateI did n't even study this triangleprofessionally so just imagine whatpeople know about the triangle that Ido n't even know that they do n't evenknow amongst themselves like it'samazing test
