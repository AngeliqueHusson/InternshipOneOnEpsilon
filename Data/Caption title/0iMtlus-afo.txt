today going talk triangle one favorite thing math particularly whenever talk always interesting pattern like talking almost never one triangle sort like addition triangle start number one every time draw one assume everything around bunch one add whatever left neighbor drop thing right alright cool two thing imagine drop one neighbor two one zero right make another one keep see triangle getting bigger nothing gon na stop keep long want long want first double digit number show get hard also combinator ist particular like problem thing want choose k many different ways turns really like childlike seem actually encode n choose k n thing particular let say four thing sand want choose let say one go fourth row move one many ways four ways four say like four circle want choose one four ways right choose one choose choose one choose one turns triangle say go fourth row like row choose one thing move one exactly manyways brad ha ran told choose two six ways notice sides always n going change keep oh plus gon na keep happening define entire diagonal every time go anything get row right one plus one plus one plus one define row felt like pattern look less fun right one three difference three one difference six three three difference turns pattern keep going around may temp ted look like right like plus three plus six start notice along top left like us anyway let look something else one might temp ted see bunch add different one plus one plus plus plus plus plus notice point stopped actually rewrite everything sum row triangle two like nth row call first one row zero sum row n let read let add let treat anything else first row next row next row hundred twenty one next row thirteen get get fourteen get right actually next row look pretty frightening wrote get pretty big number right like put comma around million brad turns know triangle n quit early happening writing actually considering place value right like place hundred place going thing rewrite hundred place first one one times row times plus one one let times squared plus times te oh times one bad plus hundred let let skip friend times plus plus plus squared times brad really cool thing found extremely recently hockey sticks method think people call really cool trick another result fact coefficient like binomial expansion make sense draw hockey stick pick one somewhere edge go diagonally going pick one go diagonally keep going point gon na veer case veer n draw number veer sum trace plus plus plus equal row diagonal rather equal gon na start one gon na awful real quickly actually gon na right work small u h let use one direction right get plus two plus three equal gon na triangle brief aside case going mean every time number odd write one every time number even write zero brad cool cool right brad still triangle yeah two n like preserve actual value much totally tell whether something even odd thats care right going outline going n world pretty nice shape maybe start look little familiar dun legend zel da th also importantly triangle n recognize triangle start equilateral triangle inscribe another one upside keep upward facing triangle many times want yeah go long time brad cool yeah turns evens odds show triangle convert make triangle big want going keep getting iteration triangle really cool brad awesome really cool get cooler construction something else two though um particular write let write got right people remind binary let see happen transcribe binary know one binary binary next one may immediately appear pretty cool kept going next one next one gon na stop look three prime five times times x x notice every time get prime go back multiply thing came generate next know n minus actually least certain actually pronounced pronounced rather mean written form n plus every time talk mathematician even minute ago ked different mathematician idea told something never hear even maybe somewhere world thing could triangle n know one person know maybe one person know one keep exploring triangle seeing collaboratively explain everything inside infinite triangle right maybe thing son hundredth line n explore feel like would n video somehow sequence n show going show sequence triangle video yeah going add shallow mean triangle kind diagonal already right like could look one kind follow shallow diagonal mean going kind go higher angle would following way drew triangle example number one shallow diagonal one n shallow one one shallow diagonal one one get one two get three one one get five know game goes three going get eight get goi na one case n believe going five plus six plus one one n add yet get brad cool two biggest recurrence relation math involve addition probably um tied together triangle unique thing know one encode related really beautiful beautiful know triangle really cool like said ear lier really childlike thing right like know add thing next plop triangle since want say grade learned half thing past month still could ramble triangle n even field like still undergraduate n even study triangle professionally imagine people know triangle n even know n even know amongst like amazing triangle triangle
