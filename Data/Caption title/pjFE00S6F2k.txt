welcome suppose a chemist is doing theexperiment and she 's measuring the pH ofsome solution as it sits there over timeapparently gets more acidic or somethingso me she 's conducting some experimentsso you know a little graph here so maybeat the time 10 minutes she finds the pHlevel is like 6.5 or something and at 15minutes she finds a little bit highermaking up some numbers does n't ever atremor she might find some other valueshe got interrupted with a phone call so27 minutes plans at some other value andso on so she plots the acidity of thesolution over time and she might get ascatter plot like this and it was likethe starter is actually increasing maybein a nice linear way and you know thisis often the case it might say all rightwe know this you know experimental errorand human error and so forth going onhere so maybe this data is actuallytrying to follow a particular line someline of best fit so maybe there 's someline here that is basically what thedata is trying to follow question is canwe actually figure out the equation thatline well have you find the line of bestfit so let me go through that there 's astandard method out there so it 's due toCol Friedrich Gauss in the in the 1800sas I should doing some astronomicalobservations but he goes here 's someDarden want to try the first straightline fit to that graph as well so youwant a straight line and try to figureout how to best fit the data onetechnique of course just to eyeball itjust get up a ruler and just you knowsee what you can draw in and then youknow forget the slope of the line youdrew and all that sort of stuff or thenyou do more mathematical process now thequestion is best fit we need to pin downwhat we mean by that now if you 're ageometry student I say okay I want tochoose some blue line like this andsomehow that 's closest to all the pointsand the way you measure distance ingeometry is always do you know thataligned segments of 90 degrees to theline and you might think you know allright I want a line that somehow if Iadd up all these distances gives me thethe least total error if I add up allthese little deviations from that blueline I get the line with the least someof red distances I 've drawn that makessense geometrically however if you thinkabout what 's really going on here forthe scientist there 's not quite makingsense each data point is not going to besort of a diagonal distance from thelinebecause this scientist knew for exampleshe was measuring the temperature at 15minutes she has complete control onthese numbers what she does n't havecontrol over is what the pH is going tobe that she measures so actually what'sappropriate way to measure distance ofdeviation of data points from a line inthis case is the deviation of the pHfrom that line that is the verticaldistances from the line which is littleauntie intuitive you think about itfirst because the from geometry I wantto go the shortest distance line isalways 90 degrees so maybe the thing todo is to find a blue line then sinceit 's philosophically appropriate forwhat a scientist actually is doing sheknows the time for sure these X valuesor T values are fixed it 's the Y valuesthe pH values in this case that or notthe deviation happens in the pH so let'sfigure out a blue line that gives atotal sum of these green verticaldistances at a minimum that means foreach data point in this it has someinitial x value of Y value how tofinalize that the Y value along the linecompared to the Y value of the actualdata the difference differences of thosedistances between those two values is ata minimum if I add them all up now howdo you measure distances in mathematicswell that 's absolute value so I want toget the least sum of distances of theform which would be like my first datavalue I should call it P 1p or somethingfor pH I 'll call of Y my actual firstdata value by the Y value for the lineplus the distance of the second datavalue from the Y value from the line forthat second one first one second one andso on so I want to minimize a sum ofabsolute values that would be if I canfind the line that is the smallestpossible son of deviations that would bemy line of best fit brilliant exceptmathematics with absolute values is ahorror to work with solving absolutevalue problems is a nightmare example ifI said to solve X minus X minus 2absolute values of minus X minus 4absolute value of that equals 7good luck to you there might be some Xvalues that do that butabsolute values is just a nightmaresilly back in the time of Gauss is theguy that first doing this you do notwant to work with absolute values so thequestion is is another way to measuredistances that are these sort ofvertical deviations which are positivenumbers without resorting to absolutevalues so you said okay another way toturn differences and to make sure theabsolute values all the time is is itpositive roads all the timeit 's do n't work with absolute value butwork with squares squaring a value sorryI 'm a championsquaring values would actually giveanother sum of positive deviations solet 's work with a line of best fit thatgives me the minimum sum of deviationssquared not quite as you know realisticas absolute value squared but at leastit gives us a very good measure andcertainly if this Sun turns out to be 0that is there are no deviations thatmeans each individual term as if thatthe sum of the deviations is here thatthe only way a sum of positive numberscan be ending up to 0 as each individualnumbers 0 then y1 and the line we haveto be a perfect match together y1 minusthe Y if I draw the line 0 that is therewill be the line that 's absolute fittingthe data perfectly so working withsquares is actually doing the rightthing for us all right now explain haveexplained the philosophy of what I'mdoing why people go with least squaresrather than least absolute values let'sgo ahead and actually figure out how todo this let me draw some actual data andI will show you how to work out the lineof least squares it 's actually not asbad as you think it might be so here 's agraph again let me give a tiny examplesuppose I 've got measuring X values andY various that when X was 1 I did anexperiment and turned out I measured Xwas why I had a value of 2 and when Xwas 2 you know maybe a two-minute markwhile I was a value thought and 6 minutemark what was the value 8 or somethingthat is I 've got some data 1 it 's 2 a 2it 's 5:00 and it 's 6 it 's 8 or somethingwell if it may it does n't really matterall right so my job is to somehow find aline of best fit through that datadoes n't look very hopeful right now allright I 'm gon na make one littleassumption just to make my math easierand in terms of assumptions true and Iexplain why it 's true later on in thevideo but it seems a totally right thatsomehow that a line that 's going to bestfit the data should go through the mostaverage point for my data for example ifI look at this the average of the xvalues which people do it by x-bar listand statistics is 1 plus 2 plus 6 that's9 divided by 3 del versus 3 so theaverage x value is 3 and the average Yvalue is 2 plus 15 divided by 3 is 5 sosome sense the most average point forthis data is the point 3 5 so somehowI 'm going to assume that the line ofbest point there 's no really trulyrepresent the data should go through themost average point now given that that'swhat I meant that 's assumption but itfeels kind of right it 's now pretty easyto work at the line of best fit by theleast squares method for example I don'tknow the slope is the slope of the linesthe only thing I need to figure out nowbecause once I 've got the slope and Iknow what point where I want it to gothrough I can say the equation line isgonna be Y minus 5 over X minus 3 isthat slope well that is place on theline is y minus 5 is whatever the slopeis X minus 3 that is there 's theequation of the line I 'm seeking andwhat know which value of M gives thebest best possible deviation all righthere goeslet me now work out what the deviationis gon na be of sort of them in thisabstract world right now so here my Xvalues here are the Y values Y on theline as my actual Y values or Capshawstraight all right when X is 1 theactual Y value is 2 and according tothis formula Y would be nowwe got this why is M X minus three plusfive that 's pretty better way so when Xis 1 this will be negative 2 n plus 5the Y value along the line is 5 minus 2mwhen X is 2 the actual Y value is 5 andthe y value called the line would beputting X was 2 negative 1 it 's 5 minusM and when X is 6 the actual Y value is8 and when X is 6 is to be a 3 5 plus 3M so whatever line I 'm coming up withthe slope M I know here the actualdepart data base for the y 2 5 & 8 andthe actual data values screwin up linewould be 5 minus 2 m 5 minus am a cat 5plus 3 M so I want to choose a value ofM that minimizes this these deviationshow far off the y values on the line arefrom the actual Y values so we want tominimize ya need space goodbye graphminimize some of these deviations andsince we do n't wan na work withoutsibelius or the difference squared 5minus 2 n minus 2 squared all right sohave a 3-2 M Squared 's the firstdeviation plus 5 minus M take away 5there 's a difference of negative M butthat nearly I 'm squared is M Squared and5 plus 3 M minus 8 that 's a differenceof 3 M minus 3 and squaredthere 's the some of my deviation squaredI want to minimize this formula allright I 'm gon na just cheat a little bitI 've actually done this out already onlyspanned all these and I can see thatthis is going to be you might we 'll justcheck me because you know you canprobably no BMO nesbitt this particularnow 14 M squared minus 30 M plus 18 so Iwant to find an M value which makes thissmaller as it can be that as I wantedthe smallest deviation of these sumssums the deviation squared was thislittle parabola I can see it 's M Squaredit 's an upward facing parabola let mejust get some interesting eggs about theM values out of this so that so I wrotethis is 14 M minus 3018 so if I use actually sketch thisgraph of M values I can see it 's gonnabeoops I need my pen very slow with my pentoday when M is zero this is a quadraticwith the value of 18 and when this partis 0 that is when M is 30 fourteenth'sit also has value of 18 it 's an upwardfacing new with two symmetrical pointsso I know the minimum is going to occurhalfway between 0 and 30 14 that 's 15fourteenth 's the min value of M is 15 14bingo there is the line there 's theslope of the line it 's going to give methe least subtle deviations squared thatis I now know the equipment of my linethat best fits the data is let 's do itin bold blue Y minus 5 is 15 14 X minus3 bingo and just as we appreciate whatwe did 3 5 was the most average pointfor the data and then all ideas actuallyworked out ok from sort of a slightlyabstract version of the line did a tableof actual y values predicted Y valuesaccording to the line and literallywrote out a formula for some a deviationsquared it will turn out for three datapoints I had a sum of three terms forfour data points over summer four tonesbut they 're only sums of things squaredit 'll always reduce to a quadratic inthe end that that 's a quadratic meansit 's very easy to find where the minimumcurves this is actually very easy to doin practice you can actually find thisby finding the minimum value of a simplequadratic in M and that 's it that is theequation of the line of least fit a bestfit least fit that 's bad all right justto be give you the e key algebra that itappears in all the books in general hereit is and you can prove this in exactlythe same way it 's actually not hard todo it 's just going to be tedious thoughif the data values are x1 x2 x3xn and the y values are y1 y2 y3 and upto yn then the line of best fit is goingto be Y minus y bar equals somethingthat people like to call cuz it comes upa lot in statistics s X Y s xx thesevariances covariances X minus X barwhere let me explain my terms X bar isjust the average of the X values justlike we did before y bar is the averagethe Y values just like we did before andthe strange SX X business is just goodrule to make sure I get it rightx1 minus X bar squared plus x2 minus Xbar square so like the deviations fromthe mean or divided by n minus 1 nowthis is little weird some authorsactually divide by n it 's notconsistency here and sxy so I can mix itup doing the same thing for the Y 's andthen exist together X 1 minus X bar Y 1minus x 1 or minus y bar plus X 2 minusX bar Y 2 minus y bar and so on ordivided by n minus 1 look looks horriblelooks really scary looks miserable butif you want to actually work out theabstract algebra it 's actually not thatbad and it turns out to be this formulayou might want to try thatall right I did start off the assumptionthat do you think the line of best fitthat 's gon na best with the data shouldgo through the most average point theway the most people prove this lines thebest fit formula is through calculus andfrom calculus it becomes pretty clearthat you 'd have to make that assumptionand that the line you get is actuallythe same line we just got here circledin blue and one can check that this lineis obviously going through the point Xbar Y bar therefore it does it do theworkthere that 's the most abstract proofusing calculus and fed that 's the realreason why Gauss did not want to useabsolute values you ca n't take thederivative and absolute value veryeasily it 's quite annoying so if youwant to use calculus on you somethingit 's actually differentiable going withsquares is a better way of turningnumbers of the positive ones and be ableto use the techniques of calculusalright that 's it that 's the line of abest fit by the least squares methodnext question of course the Cysticcourse to ask is how can you measure howgood a fit there really is and then wegive us something called the correlationcoefficient and that 's bundles of funthe heart another time there thanks verymuch test
