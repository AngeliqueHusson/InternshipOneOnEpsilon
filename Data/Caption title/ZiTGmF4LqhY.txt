you want to graph the cosine graph andyou learn how to do this in a previouslesson but the way it stands right nowthe inverse of this graph is not afunction and the reason that it is n't asyou can see that when you draw ahorizontal line like so its interceptingthe graph at more than one point okay sowhat mathematicians decided to do is torestrict the domain just look at a pieceof this cosine graph and they 're justlooking at the part from 0 to PI so whatI did here is I darkened this portionhere so that we can see a little bitbetter and now all the way it standswhen you draw a horizontal line it'sonly crossing this portion of the graphat most once so that means that theinverse of this piece will be a functionso what we 're gon na do now when you findthe inverse of a function you switch theinput in the output you switch the X andthe y values and so what we 're gon na dohere is we 're just going to locate thesepoints and we 're going to interchangethe X and the y and graph those pointsso this point right here is the point 0comma 1 okay this key point right hereis PI over 2 comma 0 and then this keypoint over here is PI comma negative 1okay so what we 're going to do now iswe 're going to switch the X and the ycoordinates so if we do that this pointhere 0 1 is now going to be 1 comma 0right so PI over 2 is 1 point 5 7 comma0 so when we switch that it 's going tobe 0 comma 1 point 5 7 because rememberpi is 3.14 and then over here when weswitch PI a negative 1 we get negative 1comma PI or we 'll just say negative 1comma 3.14 okay so now let 's plot thesepoints so one zero so one would be rightabout herebecause this is one point five seven soit 's about two-thirds of the way commazero so that 's going to be right thereso there 's there 's that point rightthere now at this point here PI over 2comma zero when we interchange those weget zero comma one point five seven sothat 's going to be 0 one point fiveseven it can be right about let 's seehere this make this to make this aboutthree so one point five seven would beright about here okay and then thispoint negative one three point one fourwe 're going to go left one which isright about therethree point one four it 's going to beright up right up over here somewhere okso now when we graph this the graphgoing to look something like this nowwhen you graph the inverse of a graphwhat you 'll notice is that it 's areflection over the line y equals x this45-degree line so if I sketch this inhereokay roughly the line y equals x isright there and you can see that thisgraph we 're actually like it 's themirror image over this 45 degree line sothat 's how you graph the cosine inversegraph just remember this graph doesn'tkeep going it just goes from this pointto this point and that 's it becausewe 're just looking at that particularportion of the cosine graph so I hopethis helped you understand how to graphit bettersubscribe to the channel check out moremath tutoring videos on my youtubechannel Mario 's math tutoring and I lookforward to helping you in the futurevideos I 'll talk to you soon test
