welcome to the solution of another quickfun brain teaser in this problem we havea right triangle which is inscribedinside of a quarter of a circle and ourgoal for this brain teaser is to findthe length of side B D of this triangleor you could say find the length of thediagonal of the rectangle ABCD we aregiven some information to help us solvethis problem we know the length from Ato B is three units and we know thelength from B to the edge of the circleis six units so using this informationwe need to find the length from B to Dthis problem can be solved quite quicklyso you can give yourself a time limit ifyou want to make it a little bit moredifficult but at this moment I recommendto pause the video now if you do n't wantto see the solution yet so how do wefind the length from B to D now there'smany different ways actually to find thesolution to this problem but thesolution I like the most can be found byflipping the triangle horizontally tothe left so now after we have flippedour triangle to the left I think it'spretty clear to see that our diagonalwhich is now the length of AC is equalto the radius of the circle and theradius of the circle has actually beengiven to us we can find this by addingthe bottom side of the circle 3 plus 6so we know the radius of the circle isequal to 9 therefore using theproperties of a circle we know that thediagonal also must be equal to 9you test
