- WELCOME TO A LESSON ON GEOMETRIC SERIES.THE GOAL OF THIS VIDEO IS TO DETERMINE THE PARTIAL SUMOF A GEOMETRIC SERIES.SUMMING OR ADDING THE TERMS OF A GEOMETRIC SEQUENCECREATES WHAT IS CALLED A SERIES.SO HERE WE HAVE A GEOMETRIC SEQUENCE , AND HERE WE HAVE A GEOMETRIC SERIES.NOTICE A SEQUENCE IS A LIST , AND A SERIES IS A SUM.THE PARTIAL SUM OF THE FIRST Nth TERMS OF A GEOMETRIC SERIESIS GIVEN BY THIS FORMULA : S SUB N = A SUB 1 x THE QUANTITY 1 - RTO THE POWER OF N DIVIDED BY 1 - R.LET 'S GO AHEAD AND TAKE A LOOKAT WHERE THIS FORMULA COMES FROM.IF WE WERE TO START WITH THE FOLLOWING GEOMETRIC SERIESAS WE SEE HERE , A SUB 1 + A SUB 1 x R + A SUB 1 x R SQUARED AND SO ON , ALL THE WAY OUT TO A SUB 1 x R TO THE POWER OF N - 1.IF WE TAKE THIS FIRST EQUATIONAND MULTIPLY BOTH SIDES OF THE EQUATION BY R , WE WOULD HAVE R x S = , AND EACH OF THESE TERMS PICKS UP AN EXTRA FACTOR OF R.SO NOW , THE FIRST TERM IS A SUB 1 x R , AND THE LAST TERM , INSTEAD OF A SUB 1 x R TO THE N -1 , WOULD BE A SUB 1 x R TO THE POWER OF N.NEXT , WHAT WE 'RE GOING TO DOIS SUBTRACT THESE TWO EQUATIONS.WE 'RE GOING TO HAVE S SUB N - R x S SUB N , AND IF WE DO THIS , MOST OF THE TERMS WILL SIMPLIFY OUT.FOR EXAMPLE , HERE WE 'D HAVE A SUB 1 x R - A SUB 1 x R , A SUB 1 x R SQUARED - A SUB 1 R SQUARED AND SO ON , ALL THE WAY OUT TO THE ENDWHERE WE 'D BE LEFT WITH A SUB 1 x R TO THE POWER OF N.SO THIS DIFFERENCE WOULD BE = A SUB 1 - A SUB 1 RTO THE POWER OF N.NOW , IF WE TAKE THE LEFT SIDE OF THE EQUATIONAND FACTOR OUT THE COMMON FACTOR OF S SUB N , WE 'D HAVE S SUB N x THE QUANTITY OF 1 - R= A SUB 1 - A SUB 1 R TO THE POWER OF N.NOW WE COULD DIVIDE BOTH SIDES OF THE EQUATION BY 1 - R , AND NOW , THERE 'S ONLY ONE MORE STEP.SO IF WE FACTOR OUT A SUB 1 IN THE NUMERATOR , WE WOULD HAVE A SUB 1 x THE QUANTITY 1 - RTO THE POWER OF N ALL DIVIDED BY 1 - R , AND THIS IS THE FORMULA THAT WE 'LL USETO FIND THE PARTIAL SUM OF A GEOMETRIC SERIES.LET 'S GO AND TAKE A LOOK AT A COUPLE EXAMPLES.HERE WE HAVE A GEOMETRIC SERIES.THE FORMULA THAT WE 'RE GOING TO USE IS LISTED HERE.WE 'LL HAVE S SUB N WITH THE SUM OF THE FIRST N TERM= A SUB 1 x 1 - R TO THE POWER OF N DIVIDED BY 1 - R.SO WE NEED TO FIND A SUB 1 , R AND N BEFORE WE CAN USE THIS FORMULA.WELL , A SUB 1 IS THE FIRST TERM , WHICH IS 3.WE CAN DETERMINE R BY USING THE FORMULA HEREWHERE WE SELECT ANY TERM IN THE SERIESAND DIVIDE BY THE TERM BEFORE IT.SO IF WE USE A SUB 2 , WE WOULD DIVIDE BY A SUB 1.6 DIVIDED BY 3 = 2.SO R = 2 , AND NOW , WE HAVE TO DETERMINE N , WHICH WOULD BE THE NUMBER OF TERMS IN THIS SERIES.AND WE CAN USE THIS FORMULA HERE FROM OUR STUDIESOF A GEOMETRIC SEQUENCE TO DETERMINE N.IF WE LET A SUB N = THE LAST TERM , THIS N HERE WILL REPRESENT THE NUMBER OF TERMS IN THE SERIES.SO A SUB N = A SUB 1 x R TO THE POWER OF N - 1.SO A SUB N = 1,536.A SUB 1 = 3.R = 2 , AND WE HAVE TO THE POWER OF N-1.WE NEED TO SOLVE THIS EQUATION FOR N.SO LET 'S DIVIDE BOTH SIDES BY 3.THIS WILL GIVE US 512 ON THE LEFTAND 2 TO THE POWER OF N - 1 ON THE RIGHT.NOW , 512 CAN BE WRITTEN AS A POWER OF 2.IT 'S ACTUALLY 2 RAISED TO THE POWER OF 9.SO FROM THAT , WE CAN DRAW THE CONCLUSIONTHAT 9 MUST = N - 1.SO IF WE ADD 1 TO BOTH SIDES OF THE EQUATION , WE KNOW THAT N MUST = 10.THIS IS ALL THE INFORMATION WE NEEDTO USE THIS PARTIAL SUM FORMULA.SO LET 'S GO AHEAD AND SEEIF WE CAN ANSWER THE QUESTION NOW.THE SUM OF THE FIRST 10 TERMS WILL BE EQUAL TO 3 x 1 - RTO THE POWER OF NOR 2 TO THE 10th DIVIDED BY 1 - R , WHICH , AGAIN , = 2.LET 'S GO AHEAD AND GO TO OUR CALCULATORAND SEE IF WE CAN DETERMINE THIS PARTIAL SUM.LET 'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE NUMERATOR FIRST.WE 'RE GOING TO HAVE 3 x THE QUANTITY 1 - 2TO THE POWER OF 10.THERE 'S OUR NUMERATOR , AND WE 'RE GOING TO DIVIDE BY 1 - 2 , WHICH OF COURSE , IS -1.SO WE HAVE 3,069 FOR THIS PARTIAL SUM.LET 'S GO AHEAD AND TAKE A LOOK AT ANOTHER EXAMPLE.ON THIS PROBLEM WE HAVE THE FORMULATHAT WILL GENERATE THE TERMS IN THE SERIESWHEN WE ALSO KNOW THERE WILL BE 5 TERMS BECAUSE N = 5.SO AGAIN , LET 'S WRITE OUT OUR FORMULA.WE WANT THE SUM OF THE FIRST 5 TERMS , BECAUSE WE KNOW N = 5.SO TO FIND THE FIRST TERM , WE 'RE GOING TO HAVE TO USE THIS FORMULA A SUB 1 = 2 x -3RAISED TO THE POWER OF N -1.WELL , IF N = 1 , 1 - 1 WOULD BE 0.-3 TO THE 0 POWER = 1.SO WE HAVE 2 x 1 OR 2.NOW , WE DO HAVE TO FIND R.IF WE CA N'T LOOK AT THIS FORMULA HEREAND SEE WHAT R WOULD BE , WE WOULD HAVE TO FIND ONE MORE TERM.SO WE COULD USE THIS FORMULA HERE TO DETERMINE R.LET 'S ASSUME WE CA N'T DETERMINE RBY LOOKING AT THE FORMULA.LET 'S GO AHEAD AND FIND THE SECOND TERM.SO WE WOULD HAVE 2 x -3 TO THE POWER OF 2 - 1RTO THE FIRST POWER.-3 TO THE FIRST = -3 x 2 , THAT 'S -6.SO R WOULD BE EQUAL TO THE SECOND TERMDIVIDED BY THE FIRST TERM OR - 6 DIVIDED BY 2 , WHICH = -3.AND AGAIN , BASED UPON YOUR EXPERIENCE , YOU MAY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SEE THAT IN THE FORMULA HERE.IT 'S THE BASE , AND WE 'RE ALSO GIVEN N = 5.THAT SHOULD BE ALL THE INFORMATION WE NEED.LET 'S GO AHEAD AND SEE IF WE CAN FIND THIS PARTIAL SUM.THE SUM OF THE FIRST FIVE TERMS = A SUB 1 , WHICH IS 2 x 1 - R RAISED TO THE POWER OF N.ALL DIVIDED BY 1 - R.WE DO HAVE TO BE A LITTLE BIT CAREFUL ABOUT THE SIGNS HERE.LET 'S GO AHEAD AND GO TO OUR CALCULATOR.LET 'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE NUMERATOR FIRST.WE HAVE 2 x THE QUANTITY 1 - ( -3 ) TO THE POWER OF 5.THERE 'S OUR NUMERATOR , AND WE 'RE GOING TO DIVIDE THIS BY -- LOOKS LIKE 1 - ( -3 ) , WHICH WOULD BE 4.WE HAVE A PARTIAL SUM OF 122.OKAY . THAT 'S GOING TO DO IT FOR THIS VIDEO.I HOPE YOU FOUND IT HELPFUL.THANK YOU FOR WATCHING . test
