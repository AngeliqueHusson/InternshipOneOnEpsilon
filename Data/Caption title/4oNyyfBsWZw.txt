this morning looking at data statisticswe very very brief he looked at surveyis what to ask like the questions you'regonna ask and how you ask it at thedifferent kinds of dhania resulting fromthem then I 'm up to what and how thevery obvious question that we did n't askwas well who are you going to give thesequestions who are you going to talk nowoops here to ask this question has twoanswers to it really what is reallyexpensive and time-consuming and almostalways impossible and the other one iskind of like a compromise that has lotsof disadvantages to it so next weekeveryone 's house always going to bedoing that census right the census isthe first answer to the question ofvideo ask and first the armed servicesjust ask everyone okay now it would be alittle more specific from that will wesay everyone a census is asking everyoneI 'll just give me a little bit morespecifically to say everyone in thetarget population everyone in the targetpopulation now that phrase tigerpopulation is pretty important so let'sjust underline that right the type ofpopulation is well the question you'reasking who they are relevant to youright depending on what you 're askingbaby you know adults are irrelevant toyour survey or baby students areirrelevant to your survey well maybepeople in another country etc etc rightso the target population is who is yoursurvey relevant to yeah like thisparticular generation yeah you couldslice it up how if you like a particulargeneration or men or women onlywhichever four have other answers youhave so who is the survey or thequestions relevant tobut of course everyone knows a censuswhile it 's going to give you it 's gotyour best chance for accurate responsesit 's like guarantee by the way couldstill be inaccurate what 's the verydisadvantage of doing a sentence acensus there 's a lot of people yeahthat 's right like if you 're sayabsolutely everyone it 's expensive it'stime-consuming which is another way ofsaying it 's expensive and as a resultit 's often it often just copied on likeit 's it 's impossible where it'simpractical to do which is why thiswhole idea of doing the census onceevery five years it 's a big dealeveryone 's got ta stay put the particularplace to do it otherwise you welcome tothe email you 're done so since Idifferences they 're wonderful they'vegot the best chance for accuracy butthey 're very hot ok so does anyone knowwhat it 's called when you do n't askabsolutely everyone starts with an Swhoa it is a selection right thisspecial word they use for it is a sampleokay so maybe you thought you 've heardthis phrase before so simple is just aportion of target populationit 's a portion now clearly this is umthis is being devised to overcome theseexact problems here but it 's solvingthese problems of expensive time andpracticality it 's on introduces its ownproblems if you 're only interviewing orquestioning a small group of people whatkinds of problems before your samplesize is quite small so you might nothave a cureokay good so the whole idea is but I'lltalk about that in a second all idea isyou have a small portion right and thenyou extrapolate from that data out tothe entire population but that might notbe accurate at all so you 're gon na sayit 's just less accurate because you'renot talking to absolutely everybodyright you can introduce we talked aboutreporting bias cognitive bias you canintroduce sample bias and I 'm gon na talkin detail about this in a second beforeI give you off road use of examplessample bias is okay your answers to yourquestions are all gon na be inclined in aparticular direction precisely becauseof who exactly you 're asking okay so Iwill love I 'll talk about that in asecond but can we just talk about someexamples when are you actually going toget like a sample that you guysencounter in daily experience let 's saywhat place assuming workplace MA you'realmost guaranteed that not everyone'sgonna answer the survey cause like ifyou do n't make it compulsory it 's just awho 's got time for that the cases ofpeople are going to skip it anddefinitely always notice you when it waslike you know the whole table shortenedthat kind of thing there are an electionpolls right now when I was little Ialways understood election polls becauseyou know a lot of views they say thirtyfive percent of voters vote for this guyright and I was like well if we gothrough five percent of voters haven'twe already done yet yeah make sure theydo we need to continue and what I didnot understand was clearly they weren'tobviously asked you everyone they'rejust talking about a portion of thepopulation so just ask us walk urbanpeople they might ask say you know let'sjust think about it this way thepopulation of Australia the last other Ihad in my head was twenty four billion Ithink it might be a bit more than thatmaybe twenty sixso let 's stick back to your work withyou in ratios under under mmm one okayif I say asked 2,400 people 2,400 peopleand then I say well okay what is that inrelation to the whole population ofAustralia what is that what 's therelationship between them sweet fourzero zero zero zero zero zero but itlooks like to me it 's ten thousand timesten thousand times yes ten thousandtimes fewer than the whole populationright so I could say within this groupof people you know if some number of thevote for this or that I 'm gon na multiplythat by ten thousand to try toextrapolate so the entire tigerpopulations okay so election pause athing I want I write down for you isteeming ratings and as they do n't knowwhat the name of the company thatorganizes TV ratings is in Australiait 's a company called AC Nielsen and theonly reason I know that it 's called ACabusin is because I was actually part offor like a year and a half the sample ofthe population we had a little boxattached there TV and every time Iturned on the TV the box would switch onand I actually had a special remote forthis box instead okay who 's watchingright and the botton you all of the agesof the people in my household all fiveof us and I 'd say okay I 'm watching andwatching there 's all the bit ages andthey say okay from thereclearly not everyone has such a box intheir house I do n't have it anymorethey 've moved on to someone else they'regoing to say like have you ever wonderedlike oh three point four million peoplewatch the finale for Game of Thronesthis you know this week it 's like how dothey know that did n't count the answeris no they did something like this rightthey took a small portion of thepopulation maybe one ten thousandth ofthe population they said how many ofthose people are watching and then theymultiplied a lot there was a little moreto it than that that 's the basic ideaso all of these kinds of ways of doingit yeah these problems of a sample biasright this is very very important so weneed to think about the kinds ofproblems that can emerge and I 'm gonnagive you some examples of who you getsasked and therefore what you sort ofworkshop with me what kinds of problemsare going to emerge you so we talkedabout the four ways and posing questionsto people do you remember what the fourways were you think back like an hourand a halfwhat were the four ways like afteryou 've got your questions how do youpose that to people okay number one faceto face will go from like most explicitto least expected after face to facethere was the phone interviews therepaper and there okay so those in or inorder of price right now if I say did aphone survey right and if I did it forinstance let 's say 10:00 a.m. on aMonday okay yeah hey these are doingright today I 'm on a Monday right and Irain people 's homes Oh Kate I 've got toget a portion of the time populationthere are people who to people but yeahI case so who will it beand the answer is it 's obviously gonnabe skewed towards retirees who are youknow working anymore who else are theygoing to be skewed toward people who areunemployed stay-at-home moms and dadsall that kind of thing right full-timestudents etc what we 're doing so you cansee just by asking it a particular waya simple biases introduced does thatmake senseyou know election polls and that kind ofthing let 's think about as anotherexample what if you go to a particulararea right so if you want to do like apaper questionnaire you 're limited likeyou 've got to physically go somewhereokay what problems might emerge ifyou 're doing like if you go to an areain general extra pot what may happenyeah fantastic so some areas I clearlythink yes this is definitely coalitionalways it definitely label a people beable to in Slam victory so depending onwhere you go a new sample bias getsintroducedokay well suppose I want to overcomethat I want to go into a place where I'mgoing to get people from all over somaybe I go to like Central StationCentral Station right like if I go to atrain station the Natura train stationis you get people from all over some tryto solve this problem but in doing sothank you you should new poll ok peopleat sexual I 'm all in a hurry to gosomewhere yeah absolutely only peopleI 'm gon na get very graceful Sinemet buteven further than you who are the kindsof people are getting if I go to aworkstation a train table okonly the kind of people who arecommuting that particular way Census vs. Sample (1 of 2: Comparison) Census vs. Sample (1 of 2: Comparison) Census vs. Sample (1 of 2: Comparison)
