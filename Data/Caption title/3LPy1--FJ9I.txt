hi in our earlier videos we have learntabout prime numbers and we have alsolearned how to find the prime numbersbetween any two given numbers and inthis video we are going to learn aboutCo prime numbers twin prime numbers andwe are also going to learn about Primetriplets right so what is the primenumber a prime number is a number whichhas only two factors one is one thenumber one and another factor is thenumber itself right so other than oneand number itself it does n't have anyother factor such numbers are calledprime numbers and what are compositenumbers composite numbers are thenumbers which can be represented as theproduct of two or more numbers thatmeans a composite number will havefactors other than 1 and the numberitself right so if any number which hasfactors other than 1 and the numberitself it is called composite numberrightso what is co-prime number co primenumbers is actually a set of two naturalnumbers having no common factors otherthan 1 so any two numbers like 3 & 4where this 3 is a prime number but this4 is actually a composite number rightbut together if I write 3 & 4 they don'thave any common factor the factors of 3are 1 & 3 and if I talk about thefactors of 4 the factors of 4 are 1 2 & 4 right so if I see the list of thefactors of both 3 & 4 they have only onecommon factor right which is 1 so 3 & 4will be called Co prime numbers then youcan have numbers like 12 and 13 12 is aneven number but 13 is an odd number andat the same time it is a prime numberalso right but there are no commonfactors between 12 and 13 so 12 and 13will also be called as Co prime numbersand nowlet me take one more examples suppose ifI take 8 and 15 the factors of 8 are 1is the factor of all the numbers then ifI try to write other factors of 8 therewill be 2 4 & 8 and if I write the setof all the factors of 15 of course 1will be there then we will have 3 thenwe will have 5 and after that we 'll have15 right and now if we see these twosets and search for the common factorswe have only one common factor which is1 right but if we see them independentlythis 8 is a composite number because itcan be written as 4 multiplied by 2 or 2multiplied by 4 or 2 x 2 x 2 this 15 isalso a composite number this can bewritten as 3 multiplied by 5 right so ifyou see them individually both of themare composite numbers but together theyare co-prime because they do n't have anyfactor other than 1 common in them rightso this group of 8 and 5 this is alsocalled set of Co prime numbers right sonow you understood what is co-primenumber Co prime numbers is actually aset of two natural numbers having nocommon factors other than one so thosetwo numbers can individually be eitherprime numbers or they can be compositenumbers but between themselves theydo n't have any common factor other than1 right so they are called Co primenumbers ok and now let 's talk about twinprime numbers so it has twin primenumbers twin prime numbers is actually aset of two prime numbers havingdifference of two so that means anyconsecutive two prime numbers which havedifference of two can be called twinprime numbers suppose 3 & 5 both of themare prime numbers right and at the sametime they have difference of 2 betweenthem so they will be calledtwin prime numbers and if I talk aboutfive and seven they are also called twinprime numbers because both of them areprime numbers and they have differenceof two between them right and if I talkabout eleven and thirteen this group isalso called a set of twin prime numbersbecause both of them are prime numbersand the difference between them is yestwo similarly a group like seventeen andnineteen this is also called twin primenumbers right and at the same time if Italk about 29 and 31 this is also a setof twin prime numbers and similarly 41and 43 this is also a set of twin primenumbers right but if I write seven andeleven this is not why because thedifference between them is four if thedifference is not equal to two then theyare not called twin prime numbers theycan be Co prime numbers because thecommon factor is one so all these groupscan be called Co prime numbers but thisseven and eleven is not a set of twinprime numbersimilarly two and three this is also nota set of twin prime numbers because thedifference over here is one okay and 13and 17 they also wo n't be referred astwin prime numbers right so I think nowyou understand what is twin primenumbers right so next is prime tripletand before going to that let me eraseall this so the definition of primetriplet is a set of three consecutiveprime numbers is called prime tripletright there is no restriction abouttheir difference any set of threeconsecutive prime numbers can be calledprime triplet so let 's take one set twothree and five this is a set of primetriplet and at the same time ifwe take 7 11 and 13 this is also a setof prime triplet so now you know what isco-prime number what is twin primenumbers and what is a prime tripletright so this is all in this video andafter this I will be uploading fewvideos on many more interesting topicsso keep watching math smart bye bye -then test
