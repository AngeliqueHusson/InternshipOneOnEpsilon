Hello ! I 'm going to go a bit `` Blue Peter '' on you today , and show you how to make thispop-up dodecahedron.Let me show you that again.Pop , like that.Now , the dodecahedron is a Platonic solidand it 's so cool , because it has twelve facesand each face is a regular pentagon.Now , the regular pentagon is a shapeof five sides of equal length , with internal angles of 108бу.First of all , we need to make this.Now , I 'm going to show you an easy way to make a regular pentagon.All you do is take a strip of paper , like this , and you tie a loose knot in it , and gently pull that tighter.If you do that , you will get a perfect regular pentagon.Cut off these edges hereand you 'll get something like this.Now , to make the dodecahedron , you 'll need some stiffish card.I find that Amazon will send youan ample supply of free cardboardwith each purchase , which is kind of them.So take your cardand your pentagon , and trace the pentagon onto the cardand trace another pentagon adjacent to each sideso it looks something like this.You 'll get six pentagonsand it kind of looks like a flower.Cut that out and score it , and if you do that , you 'll get something like this.Now this is half of your dodecahedron , so you 'll need two of them , like that.Now put them together , and then turn themjust a turn out of sync , like that.If you do that , and take an elastic band , I want you to weave the elastic bandover the top layerand under the bottom layer , over the top layer , and under the bottom layer , all the way aroundand when you 've gone all the way around -- pop ! And that 's how you do it . test
