as if you already know how to domultiplication it 's going to bebasically the exact same technique soyou have eight point two times six nowwhat you 're going to do is you 're justgoing to pretend like all the numbersare just whole numbers that this decimalis not even there just can pretend likethis is 82 times six okay so you 're withme so far so you just do six times twois twelve so I put down the ones unitand I carry the tens unit okay so 6times 2 is 12 6 times 8 is 48 plus oneis 49 ok and that 's it we 've got it nowthe only thing you have to do now is youhave to count how many decimal placesyou know has the decimal been moved soin this case you can see it 's been movedone place that 's it so you take thedecimal which is here at the right sideor the end of the number and you movethat one place so the answer here is 49point two ok let 's look at anotherexample this one here we 've got fourpoint five times two point seven nowjust a quick note you do n't have to lineup the decimal points you only do thatwhen you 're adding and subtractingdecimals with multiplying you do n't haveto line them up you 're just gon na bethinking of these numbers as two wholenumbers 45 times 27 okay so we 've got 7times 5 which is 35 so I put down theones unit and I carry the tens unit 7times 4 is 28 plus 3 is 31 I put 0 for aplaceholder there 2 times 5 is 10 I putdown the ones unit carry the tens unit 2times 4 is 8 plus the 1 is 9 and then Ijust add straight down ok and now whatwe do is we count the number of decimalplaces so we say this has been movedonce this has been moved once that 's oneplus 1 which is 2 so I 'm going to movethis decimal point 2 places to the leftfrom the right side of the numbers sothe final answer is 12 point 1 5 soyou 're getting how easy this is it'sreally just like multiplying two wholenumbers and then County the number ofdecimal places so you just kind ofignore the decimal points so let 's lookat one last example 9 point 8 times 0.2one I 'm just thinking in my mind this is98 times 21 and it does n't matter whatorder you put these in whether you putthis one here this one here it doesn'treally matter so let 's take a look athow to approach this one we 've got 1times 8 is 8 1 times 9 is 9 I put 0that 's the placeholder here 2 times 8 istene I 'm carrying the 1 2 times 9 is 18plus 1 is 19 I 'm adding straight down 9plus 6 is 15 carry the 1 that 's 10 carrythe 1ok 2058 but it looks like the decimalpoints been moved 1 2 3 places so I haveto move this 1 2 3 places it 's two pointzero five eight so that 's the finalanswer so I hope this helps you tounderstand how to work with decimals andmultiplying problems that have decimalsin themsubscribe to the channel check out someof my other videos on Mario 's math tutorand youtube channel and I look forwardto seeing in the future videos I 'll talkto you soon test
