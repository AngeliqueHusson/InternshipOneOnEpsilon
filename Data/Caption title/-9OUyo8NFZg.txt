In my video on the circle division problem , I referenced Euler¡¯s Characteristic Formula , and here I would like to share a particularly nice proof of this fact.It¡¯s very different from the inductive proof typically given , but I¡¯m not trying to arguethat this is somehow better or easier to understand than other proofs.Instead , I chose this topic to illustrate one example of the incredible notion of duality , and how it can produce wonderfully elegant math.First , let¡¯s go over what the theorem states.If you draw some dots with some lines between them , that is , a graph , and if none of thelines intersect , which is to say you have a planar graph , and if your drawing is connected , then Euler¡¯s Formula states that the number of dots , minus the number of lines , plus thenumber of regions these lines cut the plane into , including that outer region , will alwaysbe 2.Because Euler was originally talking about 3d polyhedra when he found this formula , whichwas only later reframed in terms of planar graphs , instead of saying ¡°dots¡± , we say¡°vertices¡± , instead of saying ¡°lines¡± we say ¡°edges¡± , and instead of saying¡°regions¡± we say ¡°faces¡± , hence we write Euler¡¯s discovery as V-E+F=2.Before describing the proof , I need to go through three pieces of graph theory terminology : Cycles , spanning trees , and dual graphs.If you are already familiar with some of these topics and don¡¯t care to see how I describethem , feel free to click the appropriate annotation to skip ahead.Imagine a tiny creature is sitting on one of the vertices.Let¡¯s name him ¡°Randolph¡±.If we think of edges as something Randolph might travel along , from one vertex to thenext , we can sensibly talk about a ¡°path¡± as being a sequence of edges that Randolphcould travel along , where we don¡¯t allow him to back-track on the same edge.A ¡°cycle¡± is simply a path that ends on the same vertex where it begins.You might be able to guess how cycles will be important for our purposes , since eachthey always enclose a set of faces.Now imagine Randolph wants access to all other vertices , but that edges are expensive , sohe¡¯ll only buy access to an edge if it gives him a path to an untouched vertex.This frugality will leave him with a set of edges without any cycles , since the edge finishingoff a cycle would always be unnecessary.In general a connected graph without cycles is called a tree , so named because we canmove things around to make it look like a system of branches , and any tree inside agraph which touches all vertices is called a ¡°spanning tree¡±.Before defining the ¡°dual graph¡± , which runs the risk of being confusing , it¡¯s importantto remember why people actually care about graphs in the first place.I was actually lying earlier when I said a graph is a set of dots and lines , really it¡¯sa set of anything with any notion of connection , but we typically represent those things withdots and those connections with lines.For instance , Facebook stores an enormous graph , where vertices are accounts and edgesare friendships.Although we can use drawings to represent this graph , the graph itself is the abstractset of accounts and friendships , distinct from the drawing.All sorts of things are undrawn graphs : The set of english words , considered connectedwhen they differ by one letter ; mathematicians , considered connected if they¡¯ve writtena paper together ; neurons connected by synapses.Or maybe , for those of us reasoning about the actual drawing of a graph on the plane , we can take the set of faces this graph cuts the plane into , and consider two of them connectedif they share an edge.In other words , if you can draw a graph in the plane without intersecting the edges , you automatically get a second , as of yet undrawn graph , whose vertices are faces , andwhose edges are ... well ... edges of the original graph.We call this the ¡°dual¡± of the original graph.If you want to represent the dual graph with dots and lines , first put a dot inside eachof the faces.I personally like to visualize the dot for the outer region as being a point at infinity , where you can travel in any direction to get there.Next , connect these new dots with new lines that pass through the centers of each oldline , where lines connected to the point at infinity can go off the screen in any direction , as long as it is understood that they all meet at the same one point.But keep in mind that this is just a drawing of the dual graph , just as a representationof facebook accounts and friendships with dots and lines is just drawing of the socialgraph , the dual graph itself is the collection of faces and edges.The reason I stress this point is to emphasize that edges of the original graph and edgesof the dual graph are not just related , they are the same thing ! ( Or at least , I would argue they should be thought of that way ) .You see , what make the dual graph all kinds of awesome is the many ways it relates tothe original graph.For example , cycles in the original graph correspond to connected components of thedual graph , and likewise cycles in the dual graph correspond with connected componentsof the original graph.Now for the cool part.Suppose our friend Randolph has an alter-ego , Mortimer , living in the dual graph , travelingfrom face to face instead of from vertex to vertex , passing over edges to do so.Let¡¯s say Randolph has bought all the edges of a spanning tree , and that Mortimer is forbiddenfrom crossing those edges.It turns out the edges Mortimer has available to him are guaranteed to form a spanning treeof the dual graph ! To see why , we only need to check the two defining properties of spanning trees : Theymust give Mortimer access to all faces , and there can be no cycles.The reason he still has access to all faces is that it would take a cycle in Randolph¡¯sspanning tree to insulate him from a face , but trees can not have cycles.The reason Mortimer can not traverse a cycle in the dual graph feel completely symmetric : If he could , he would separate one set of Randolph¡¯s vertices from the rest , so thespanning tree from which he is banned could not have spanned the whole graph.So not only does the planar graph have a dual graph , any spanning tree within that graphalways has a dual spanning tree in the dual graph.So here¡¯s the kicker : the number of vertices in a tree is always one more than the numberedges.To see this , note that after you start with the root vertex , each new edge gives exactly1 new vertex.Alternatively , within our narrative , you could think of Randolph as starting with one vertex , and gaining exactly one more for each edge that he buys in what will become a spanningtree.Since this tree covers all vertices of our graph , the number of vertices is one morethan the number of edges owned by Randolph.Moreover , since the remaining edges make up a spanning tree for Mortimer¡¯s dual graph , the number of edges he gets is one more than the number of vertices of the dual graph , which are the faces cut out by the original graph.Putting this together , it means the total number of edges is 2 more than the numberof vertices plus the number of faces , which is exactly what Euler¡¯s formula states !
