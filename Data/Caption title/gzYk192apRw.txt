let talk easiest way think idea mutually take simple example like drawing one card standard deck well card let find deck right layout card pick one random probability ace hearts well one n probability one much pretty obvious repeat experiment say well probability curious probability ace hearts king diamond whats probability well one one king diamond sin whole deck let ask secondary question shuffle deck lay front pick random probability card pick either ace hearts king diamond well two good option n know one either overall probability sum two choice worked mutually exclusive would impossible card pick ace hearts diamond time one card let phrase general question suppose one card card ask probability card pick well could ace hearts ace ace ace club mean probability ask probability card end heart think different option sand way also jack queen king ace give let ask similar question say problem card pick either ace ora heart may temp ted write would wrong reason wrong ace hearts got twice ace heart see works let think set give us ace going actually draw diagram wherein box card left hand side ace card let draw another blob represent heart card notice know actually four ace total hearts total one ace hearts intersection overlap zone mean three hearts hearts ace diagram example ask question probability card ace hearts add anything one thing one three one get getting somewhere see correct probability way thats roughly thirty point eight percent general two event let call b want know probability b happen thats equal probability probability b probability b happen think equation term example saw like saying probability card pick ace heart going equal probability ace plus probability heart minus probability ace exactly see us plus notice get result let see make sense diagram well think calculating belong let shade add thing belong b case hearts shade count thing well notice something anything intersection twice good need remove count thing need make sure everything set exactly thats equation make sense may hear two event b mutually exclusive probability bis equal probability plus probability b reason think diagram mutually exclusive overlap really regular old equation subtract ing zero intersection nothing general need remember big equation purple box tell deal either mutually exclusive event event mutually exclusive n forget subscribe video update like video n forget give us thumb next time pick deck card remember statistics reason want show key way remember log base b number base b something calculator want change mutually exclusive event pick card card mutually exclusive event pick card card mutually exclusive event pick card card mutually exclusive event pick card card mutually exclusive event pick card card mutually exclusive event pick card card mutually exclusive event pick card card mutually exclusive event pick card card mutually exclusive event pick card card mutually exclusive event pick card card
