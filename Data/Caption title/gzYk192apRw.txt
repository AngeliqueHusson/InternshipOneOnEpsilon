let 's talk about some probabilities theeasiest way to think about probabilitiesand the idea of mutually exclusiveevents is to take a simple example likedrawing one card from a standard deck ofwell shuffled cards so let 's find a deckall right we 're shuffled so now if Ilayout these 52 cards and I pick one atrandom what 's the probability that I endup with the ace of hearts well this onewas n't it the probability is just oneout of 52 that much is pretty obvious ifI repeat the experiment and I say wellwhat 's the probability now I 'm notcurious about the probability of ace ofhearts but for King of Diamonds what'sthe probability well again it 's one outof 52 there is only one King of Diamondsin this whole deck now let me ask you asecondary question if I was to shufflethe deck lay them out in front of me andpick at random what is the probabilitythat the card I pick is either an ace ofhearts or a king of diamonds well thereare two good options and I do n't know ifthis one is either of those but theoverall probability will be 2 out of 52it 's just the sum of the two choices nowthat worked out because those twochoices were mutually exclusive it wouldbe impossible for the card that I pickto be both the ace of hearts and theKing of Diamonds at the same time it'sjust one card so now let 's phrase a moregeneral question again suppose that I'mjust picking one card from a shuffleddeck of 52 cards and I ask what is theprobability that the card I pick is anace well it could be an ace of hearts oran ace of spades or an ace of diamondsor an ace of clubs so there are 4 goodchoices and that means that myprobability is 4 out of 52 if I then askwhat is the probability that the card Iend up with was a heart now I have tothink about all the different optionsand there 's a 2 a 3 all the way up to 10and there 's also Jack and Queen and Kingand ace so that gives me 13 out of 52okay now let 's ask the similar questionwhere we say what is the problemthe card that I pick is either an ace ora heart you may be tempted to just goahead and write 4 out of 52 + 13 out of52 but that would be wrong the reasonwhy it 's wrong is because the ace ofhearts got counted twice once as beingan ace and once at being a heart solet 's see why this works let 's thinkabout the set of all the outcomes whichgive us an ace and what we 're going todo is actually draw a Venn diagram wherein the box we have all 52 cards the blobon the left hand side just representsall the ACE cards and then let 's drawanother blob which represents all of theheart cards now notice that I 've havethose overlapping we know that there areactually four aces in total and thereare 13 hearts in total but there 's oneace of hearts so that is in theintersection in that overlap zone whatthat means is that there are three otheraces which are not hearts and there are12 other hearts which are not aces sothat 's the Venn diagram which explainsthe example now if I ask the questionwhat is the probability that my card isan ace or hearts all I have to do is goahead and add up anything that belongsto one of those things one of thosepieces that 's the three the one and the12 what do I get 16 out of 52 okay sowe 're getting somewherenow we see this is the correctprobability and by the way that'sroughly thirty point eight percent ingeneral if we have two events let 's callthem a and B and we want to know theprobability that a or B happens that'sequal to the probability that a happensplus the probability that B happensminus the probability that a and B bothhappen if we think about this equationin terms of the example we just saw thisis like saying the probability that thecard we pick is a ace or a heart isgoing to be equal to the probabilitythat 's an ace plus the probabilitythat 's a heart minus the probabilitythat it 's both so it 's an ace of heartsand that 's exactly what we see thatgives us 4 out of 52 plus 13 out of 52mineone out of 52 notice we get the sameresult let 's see why this makes sense interms of the Venn diagram well if wethink about calculating up all thethings that belong to a let 's shadethose in and we 've counted them all oncenow we add up all the things that belongto B in this case hearts and we shadethat up we count all those things onceas well but notice something anythingthat was in the intersection thatcounted twice and that 's no good we needto remove that count once so that we'vecounted those things only once we needto make sure that everything in the setwe have is counted exactly once that'swhy this equation makes senseso you may have heard that if you havetwo events a and B which are mutuallyexclusive then the probability of A or Bis equal to the probability of a plusthe probability of B the reason why thisis is because if you think about theVenn diagram mutually exclusive meansthat there is no overlap so really allwe 're doing is using the regular oldequation and just subtracting zerobecause their intersection is nothing soin general all you need to remember isthe big equation in the purple box andthat tells you how to deal with eithermutually exclusive events or events thatare not mutually exclusive do n't forgetto subscribe for video updates and ifyou like this video do n't forget to giveus a thumbs up so the next time that youpick up a deck of cards remember it'sall about statistics the reason why I'vewritten down most of it is because Iwant to show you a key way to rememberit if you have log base B of a number Nand base B is not something on yourcalculator so you want to change Mutually
