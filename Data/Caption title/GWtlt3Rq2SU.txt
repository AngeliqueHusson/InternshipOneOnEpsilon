construct degree angle construct angle need two arms initial arm let draw ray b c put initial arm remember array point extend indefinitely inone direction need construct angle terminal arm keep compass point b convenient width width draw arc ray b c point change width compass youve drawn arc width unchanged keep compass point draw arc point e change width compass move compass point draw arc across previous point draw array starting point b towards yes degree angle remember make first stock compass make two like without construct degree angle construct degree angle
