hi rob welcome math antic sin last two algebra video learned solve simple one arithmetic operation often equation many different make little video going learn solve two math operation addition subtraction operation one multiplication division operation concept learn video help solve even complicated equation future might expect equation two arithmetic operation going require two different step solve word get unknown need undo two sound hard right learned undo arithmetic operation last two video sand true couple reason make two step equation little solve first lot possible combination two operation sand second one operation decide order undo operation need know order operation follow order operation watch video sure order operation rule tell us order order undo reverse order since undoing operation snow good idea well course equation basically going order operation rule reverse help us know order undo operation little tricky actually see works let start simple two step equation equation unknown value x involved two different multiplication imp lied first x undo two operation need use inverse division question one first like many thing life order decide thing make big difference ah come got ta easier way voice screen first sock fortunately math special set rule tell us order operation rule tell us operation inside parentheses group exponent multiplication division last addition subtraction rule need follow simplify ing mathematical expression equation different trying undo unknown value involved unknown value equation best strategy apply order operation rule reverse order operation way solve equation usually easiest way like much easier take sock reverse order put sure sock order operation rule tell us multiplication addition undo addition undo multiplication first undo addition subtract ing sides equation first side plus minus cancel leaving side side minus undo multiplication dividing sides equation first side cancel leaving x side divided solve equation order operation rule reverse know x bad let try another simple two step equation division subtraction going apply order operation rule reverse undo subtraction division would normally subtraction last going undo first undo subtraction add sides equation first side minus plus cancel leaving x side side plus undo divided need multiply sides first side cancel leaving x side times answer x example pretty easy right two step equation get bit little something math cal led group remember parentheses used group thing order operation rule say supposed operation inside parentheses first word need operation inside group first well guess mean equation undoing need wait group last see mean let solve equation look similar first one difference set parentheses used group x together even though might seem like much change make big difference answer original equation first x new equation entire quantity group x going change solve still going follow order operation rule reverse x inside parentheses mean part group going undo operation last since supposed operation group first mean going undo operation group last problem start undoing multiplication thats imp lied group x divide sides equation first side top bottom cancel leaving group x side side divided look simpler already make even simpler nothing else side equal sign group x really even need parentheses next need subtract first side plus minus cancel leaving x side minus equation x see grouping operation differently equation result different try one important example remember second equation solve equation entire x term take look slightly different equation look lot like original equation top fraction line x x top form group hold x group see parentheses bracket around ah good question algebra fraction line used way automatically group thing thing example fancy algebraic expression everything top fraction line form group everything bottom line form another group course could put parentheses wan ted make really clear fraction line imp lied algebra getting back new problem know x top fraction line imp lied group learned last example going wait undo operation inside group last first step undo divided multiplying sides equation first side top bottom cancel leaving imp lied group x side side times undo operation inside group first side minus plus cancel leaving x side plus equation x see two step equation definitely complicated single step many different combination different ways group take thing one step time remember undo operation reverse order operation rule sit much easier pay close attention thing grouped equation lookout imp lied group top bottom fraction line many variation two step equation sit really important practice trying solve lots different always thanks watching math
