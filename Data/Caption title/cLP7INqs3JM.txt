So let 's talk a little bit about rational numbers.And the simple way to think about it is any number thatcan be represented as the ratio of two integersis a rational number.So for example , any integer is a rational number.1 can be represented as 1/1 or as negative 2 over negative 2or as 10,000/10,000.In all of these cases , these are all different representationsof the number 1 , ratio of two integers.And I obviously can have an infinite numberof representations of 1 in this way , the same number over the same number.The number negative 7 could be represented as negative 7/1 , or 7 over negative 1 , or negative 14 over positive 2.And I could go on , and on , and on , and on.So negative 7 is definitely a rational number.It can be represented as the ratio of two integers.But what about things that are not integers ? For example , let us imagine -- oh , I do n't know -- 3.75.How can we represent that as the ratio of two integers ? Well , 3.75 , you could rewrite thatas 375/100 , which is the same thing as 750/200.Or you could say , hey , 3.75 is the same thing as 3and 3/4 -- so let me write it here -- which is the same thing as -- that 's 15/4.4 times 3 is 12 , plus 3 is 15 , so you could write this.This is the same thing as 15/4.Or we could write this as negative 30 over negative 8.I just multiplied the numerator and the denominatorhere by negative 2.But just to be clear , this is clearly rational.I 'm giving you multiple examples of howthis can be represented as the ratio of two integers.Now , what about repeating decimals ? Well , let 's take maybe the most famousof the repeating decimals.Let 's say you have 0.333 , just keeps going on and on forever , which we can denote by putting that little bar on topof the 3.This is 0.3 repeating.And we 've seen -- and later we 'll showhow you can convert any repeating decimalas the ratio of two integers -- this is clearly 1/3.Or maybe you 've seen things like 0.6 repeating , which is 2/3.And there 's many , many , many other examples of this.And we 'll see any repeating decimal , not justone digit repeating.Even if it has a million digits repeating , as long as the pattern starts to repeat itselfover and over and over again , youcan always represent that as the ratio of two integers.So I know what you're probably thinking.Hey , Sal , you've just included a lot.You 've included all of the integers.You 've included all of finite non-repeating decimals , and you 've also included repeating decimals.What is left ? Are there any numbers that are not rational ? And you 're probably guessing that there are , otherwise people would n't have takenthe trouble of trying to label these as rational.And it turns out -- as you can imagine -- that actuallysome of the most famous numbers in all of mathematicsare not rational.And we call these numbers irrational numbers.And I 've listed there just a few of the mostnoteworthy examples.Pi -- the ratio of the circumferenceto the diameter of a circle -- is an irrational number.It never terminates.It goes on and on and on forever , and it never repeats.e , same thing -- never terminates , never repeats.It comes out of continuously compounding interest.It comes out of complex analysis.e shows up all over the place.Square root of 2 , irrational number.Phi , the golden ratio , irrational number.So these things that really just pop outof nature , many of these numbers are irrational.Now , you might say , OK , are these irrational ? These are just these special kind of numbers.But maybe most numbers are rational , and Sal 's just picked out some special cases here.But the important thing to realize is they do seem exotic , and they are exotic in certain ways.But they are n't uncommon.It actually turns out that there is alwaysan irrational number between any two rational numbers.Well , we could go on and on.There 's actually an infinite number.But there 's at least one , so that gives you an ideathat you can't really say that thereare fewer irrational numbers than rational numbers.And in a future video , we 'll provethat you give me two rational numbers -- rational 1 , rational 2 -- there 's going to be at least one irrational numberbetween those , which is a neat result , because irrational numbers seem to be exotic.Another way to think about it -- I took the square root of 2 , but you take the square root of any non-perfect square , you 're going to end up with an irrational number.You take the sum of an irrationaland a rational number -- and we 'll see this later on.We 'll prove it to ourselves.The sum of an irrational and a rationalis going to be irrational.The product of an irrational and a rationalis going to be irrational.So there 's a lot , a lot , a lot of irrational numbersout there . test
