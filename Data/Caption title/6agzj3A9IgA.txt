Use completing the square to find the roots of thequadratic equation right here.And when anyone talks about roots , this just means findthe x 's where y is equal to 0.That 's what a root is.A root is an x value that will make this quadratic functionequal 0 , that will make y equal 0.So to find the x 's , let's just make y equal 0 andthen solve for x.So we get 0 is equal to 4x squared plus 40x , plus 280.Now , the first step that we might want to do , just becauseit looks like all three of these terms are divisible by4 , is just divide both sides of this equation by 4.That 'll make our math a little bit simpler.So let 's just divide everything by 4 here.If we just divide everything by 4 , we get 0 is equal to xsquared plus 10x , plus -- 280 divided by 4 is 70 -- plus 70.Now , they say use completing the square , and actually , letme write that 70 a little bit further out , and you 'll seewhy I did that in a second.So let me just write a plus 70 over here , just to have kindof an awkward space here.And you 'll see what I 'm about to do with this space , thathas everything to do with completing the square.So they say use completing the square , which means , turnthis , if you can , into a perfect square.Turn at least part of this expression into a perfectsquare , and then we can use that to actually solve for x.So how do we turn this into a perfect square ? Well , we have a 10x here.And we know that we can turn this into a perfect squaretrinomial if we take 1/2 of the 10 , which is 5 , and thenwe square that.So 1/2 of 10 is 5 , you square it , you add a 25.Now , you ca n't just willy-nilly add a 25 to oneside of the equation without doing something to the other , or without just subtracting the 25 right here.Right ? Think about it , I have not changed the equation.I 've added 25 and I've subtracted 25.So I 've added nothing to the right-hand side.I could add a billion and subtract a billion and notchange the equation.So I have not changed the equation at all right here.But what I have done is I've made it possible to expressthese three terms as a perfect square.That right there , 2 times 5 is 10.5 squared is 25.So that is x plus 5 squared.And if you do n't believe me , multiply it out.You 're going to have an x squared plus 5x , plus 5x , which will give you 10x , plus 5 squared , which is 25.So those first three terms become that , and then thesecond two terms , right there , you just add them.Let 's see , negative 25 plus 70.Let 's see , negative 20 plus 70 would be positive 50 , and thenyou have another 5 , so it 's plus 45.So we 've just algebraically manipulated this equation.And we get 0 is equal to x plus 5 squared , plus 45.Now , we could 've , from the beginning if we wanted , wecould 've tried to factor it.But what we 're going to do here , this will always work.Even if you have crazy decimal numbers here , you can solvefor x using the method we 're doing here , completing the square.So to solve for x , let 's just subtract 45 from both sides ofthis equation.And so the left-hand side of this equation becomes negative45 , and the right-hand side will be justthe x plus 5 squared.These guys , right here , cancel out.Now , normally if I look at something like this I 'll say , OK , let 's just take the square root of bothsides of this equation.And so you might be tempted to take the square root of bothsides of this equation , but immediately when you do that , you 'll notice something strange.We 're trying to take the square rootof a negative number.And if we 're dealing with real numbers , which is everythingwe 've dealt with so far , you ca n't take a square root of anegative number.There is no real number that if you square it will give youa negative number.So it 's not possible -- I don't care what you make x -- it isnot possible to add x to 5 and square it , andget a negative number.So there is no x that can satisfy -- if we assume that isx is a real number -- that can satisfy this equation.Because I do n't care what x you put here , what real x youput here , you add 5 to it , you square it , there 's no wayyou 're going to get a negative number.So there 's no x that can satisfy this equation , so wecould say there are no -- and I 'm using the word realbecause in Algebra 2 you'll learn that there are thingscalled complex numbers , but do n't worry about that rightnow -- but there no real roots to the quadratic equation.And we 're done.And actually , if you had tried to factor it , you would havefound it very difficult , because this is not afactorable expression right here , and you know it becausethere 's no real roots .
