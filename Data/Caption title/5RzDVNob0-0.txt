Use the associative law of multiplication to write -- andhere they have 12 times 3 in parentheses , and then theywant us to multiply that times 10 -- in a different way.Simplify both expressions to show theyhave identical results.So the way that they wrote it is -- let me just rewrite it.So they have 12 times 3 in parentheses , and then theymultiply that times 10.Now whenever something is in parentheses , that means dothat first . So this literally says let 's do the 12 times 3first . Now , what is 12 times 3 ? It 's 36.So this evaluates to 36 , and then we still have that times10 over there.And we know the trick.Whenever we multiply something times a power of ten , we justadd the number of zeroes that we have at the back of it , sothis is going to be 360.This is going to be equal to 360.Now , the associative law of multiplication , once again , itsounds like a very fancy thing.All that means is it doesn't matter how we associate themultiplication or it doesn't matter how we put theparentheses , we 're going to get the same answer , so let mewrite it down again.If we were to do 12 times 3 times 10 , if we just wrote itlike this without parentheses , if we just went left to right , that would essentially be exactly what we just did hereon the left.But the associative law of multiplicationsays , you know what ? We can multiply the 3 times 10 first and then multiply the12 , and we 're going to get the exact same answer as if wemultiplied the 12 times the 3 and then the 10.So let 's just verify it for ourselves.So 3 times 10 is 30 , and we still want to multiply the 12times that.Now , what 's 12 times 30 ? And we 've seen this several times before.You can view it as a 12 times 3 , which is 36 , but we stillhave this 0 here.So that is also equal to 360.So it did n't matter how we associated the multiplication.You can do the 12 times 3 first or you can do the 3times 10 first . Either way , they both evaluated to 360 . test
