all right in this video I 'm going totalk about adding and subtractingpolynomials and remember a polynomial isbasically you have X 's or some variableto positive whole numbers you can haveany number you want out front of thevariables again as long as you havepositive and negative whole numbers andthen you can also just have regularnumbers floating around there as wellthere does n't have to be a variableattached to them so x squared plussquare root of 2x to the eighth plusfour that would be an example of apolynomial so in this first example hereI 've got two polynomials that I want toadd notice they 're in parenthesis soremember we can think about there beinga positive one out front of those and wehave to distribute the positive one toeach term on both parts to get rid ofthe parentheses so I 'll simply have a 1xsquared plus 4x plus 5 and then plus 6xplus 3 and this is where we now have tocombine our like terms so I see an xsquared term but I do n't see any other xsquared terms in there so that meansthere 's only a single x squared term nowI look at things that have an X attachedto them so I see a 4x term and I see a 6X term and what you do is you simply dothe arithmetic with the numbers outfront of those so positive 4 andpositive 6 is positive 10 and then wejust attach your X and then we 've got apositive 5 and a positive 3 leftoverwhich will give us simply positive 8okay in our next example here same ideabut now we have some numbers besides onethat we need to distribute out so on myfirst term I 'll get two times X to thefourth which is just 2x to the fourthand then again you basically do thearithmetic with the numbers out frontand just kind of stick the variable onso two times five is positive 10 andthen I stick my X on and now I do thesame thing on the other againrecognizing now that the thing that getsdistributed is the negative six so thatwill get multiplied by X to the fourthby positive 8x and by negative three soI 'll have negative six x to the fourththen I think okay so if I multiply thenegative six by the positive eight Xterm a negative times a positive is anegative 6 times 8 is 48 and then Isimply stick my X on thereand lastly negative 6 times negative 3that gives me positive 18 remember twonegatives make a positiveand again I have to combine my liketerms so I see an X to the fourth termand an X to the fourth term 2 minus 6 isnegative 4 X to the fourth so that willtake care of that and that I then have apositive 10x minus 48 X positive 10minus 48 is going to give us negative 38X that 'll take care of that and that andthen I have my whole number positive 18just hanging out there 's nothing tocombine it with so we 'll simply leavethat as positive 18 okay let 's do let'sdo another example here maybe one alittle more complicated suppose we havex times 2x plus 3 we 'll say minus 4xsquaredlet 's make it a three X to the firstplus four let 's even throw one more inthere why not so minus six x squaredtimes x squared plus X okay so you seeif I can squeeze all that in there Ithink I 've got it all there so the sameidea now I have to distribute my X tothese first terms so X so you can thinkabout one you can think about X as being1 X so 1 times 2 is 2 X to the firsttimes X to the first remember you addthe exponents you 'll get x squared let Iknew the same thing positive 1 timespositive 3 is positive 3 there 's an Xhere there 's no X 's there so you 'll justhave an X to the first term now I moveto my next term so I multiplyingnegative 4 x squared by everything wellthis is positive 3 so a negative times apositive is a negative4 times 3 is 12 x squared times X to the1st remembering we add exponents willgive us X to the 3rd then I have todistribute this negative 4x squared tomy positive 4 term so a negative times apositive is a negative4 times 4 is 16 and then I simply haveto stick my x squared on there and lastbut not least the same thing I 'm goingto multiply my negative six x squared byboth of these terms so you can thinkabout the coefficients the numbers outfront of the x squared and the X isbeing a 1 so a negative 6 times apositive one is negative 6 x squaredtimes x squared is X to the fourth thenI 'll have a negative 6 times a positive1 again that gives me negative 6 and xsquared times X to the first is going togive us simply X to the thirdand again now we have to combine ourlike terms and I usually do them indescending order which means we look atthe highest power first so if you lookat the power on the first term those aretwo then a 1 then a 3 then a 2 then a 4then a theory so I 'm going to write thisnegative 6x to the fourth term firstso that 'll take care of that part andthen I 'll do my mic to the powers ofthree so then I see at negative 12 X tothe third and a negative 16 X to thethird well again we combined the numbersout front so negative 12 minus 6 isgoing to give us negative 18 X to thethird so that will now take care of thisterm and this term as well then I havenegative 16 x squared and a positive 2 xsquared negative 16 plus 2 is negative14x squared so that 'll take care of thex squared terms and then the only thingI 'm left with is the positive 3x termand I have now done my third example Ihave added and subtracted and combinedall the like terms and this is kind ofconsidered the simplified version ofthat polynomial so a few basic exampleshere of adding and subtractingpolynomials if you want to see someother stuff about polynomials feel freeto visit my website on the left handside there 's a there 's
