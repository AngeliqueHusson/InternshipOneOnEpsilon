in this example were given a histogramthat shows the number of people admittedto an emergency room during a 24-hourperiodthe histogram tells us that between12:00 a.m. and 3:59 a.m. 16 people wereadmitted to the emergency room between 4a.m . and 7:59 a.m. nine people wereadmitted between 8 a.m. and 11:59 a.m.eight people were admitted between 12:00p.m . and 3:59 p.m. eight people wereadmitted between 4:00 p.m. and 7:59 p.m.12 people were admitted and between 8p.m . and 11:59 p.m.20 people were admitted notice thatunlike a bar graph a histogram has nospaces between the bars because the timeintervals on the horizontal axis arecontinuous and it 's important tounderstand that we must use equal timeintervals throughout in this case we usefor our time intervals now in Part Awe 're asked during which time intervalswere more than 10 people admitted we cansee that more than 10 people wereadmitted between 12:00 a.m. and 359 a.m.between 4:00 p.m. and 759 p.m. andbetween 8 p.m. and 11:59 p.m. in Part Bwere asked what is the range of theclasses classes is another word forintervals so what is the range of theclasses means the same thing as how bigis each interval we can see that eachinterval is 4 hours long so the range ofthe classes is 4 hours notice that thishistogram is u-shaped which suggeststhat emergency room visits tend to bemore common at night than during the day Histograms | MathHelp.com Histograms | MathHelp.com Histograms | MathHelp.com
