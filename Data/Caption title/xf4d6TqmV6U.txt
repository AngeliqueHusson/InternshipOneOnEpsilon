Next we 're going to talk about axis , and the way we can show that is we have a horizontalaxis that we call X , and also we have a vertical axis we call Y . And these are two axes , alright ? Where they cross is called an origin , which has the value zero , zero . Now we can thinkabout this axis as a number line with positive values in the X axis , positive values to theright , and negative values to the left of the origin.Similarly on the Y axis , we have something that looks ninety degrees . We have one , two , three , four , five , and going the negative direction below the origin , we have negativeone , negative two , negative three , negative four , negative five . Now this can go on forever.And this plane , this rectangular coordinate plane is sometimes referred as the CartesianCoordinate , and we can divide this plane into four quadrants . The first quadrant has thevalues of X , all positive , and the values of Y , all positive . The second quadrant hasnegative values of X and positive values of Y . The third quadrant , we 're going counter-clockwisehere , the third quadrant , X values are negative , Y values are also negative . And then the lastquadrant , which is the fourth quadrant , X values are positive , Y values are negative.So the Cartesian Coordinates are divided into four quadrants : quadrant one , positive positive ; quadrant two , negative positive ; quadrant three , negative negative ; quadrant four , positivenegative . test
