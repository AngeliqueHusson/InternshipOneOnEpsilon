okay the division problems I 've beendoing so far all worked out very nicelyso example we did 260by 12 is 23 we saw that as follows wedrew a picture 236 drew a picture 12 welook for groups of 12 in a picture to 361 dot next to two dots unavailable oneup next to dots one at that level 1 dotX to 2 dots one at that level anotherone at that same level and another oneat that level yet again so two at theones though attends level three at theone 's level 23 grips at all grand ok adeed that was a very nice problem whereit had to be good whole number so myquestions now is what if I change thisproblems to say 277 divided by 12 whatwould we see will be the difference okaywhat a picture would n't be this anymorethey 've been out p227 7 which is 2.7dots and one extra yonder we 're stillgoing to be here looking for groups of12 and we 'll see exactly this but we seethis one extra dot how do we interpretthat one extra dot well we have to saythen that 2 Sigma x divided by 12 is 23yeptwo groups and three groups with oneextra remaining dot well depending whatgrade level you 're in you might writeyour remainder one or in some countriesmight write dot dot one you might writedifferent ways but maybe it probably thecorrect way to write in terms likeyou 've going to be like trulymathematically correct to say it 's 23plus one more dot still waiting to bedivided by 12 so it 's 23 plus 1 12 mypoint is this long division approachwith pictures is kind of brilliant Ilove it so much because if it turns outthere were remainders do you know whatyou will just see them they 'll just sitthere right before your very eyesand you 'll know exactly what to do withthem so even if the division problemsnot nice remainders or a piece of cakeyou can see what 's going on close of fungood stuff test
