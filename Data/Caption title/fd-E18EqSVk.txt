hi welcome math antic sin video going learn important math concept cal led rounding help understand rounding let think usually used time used represent amount many super market many days birthday many student went high school many student went high school oh exactly well like probably exactly either well fine first number used represent student high school round number good estimate many student exact next two little closer truth still estimate sonly final number exact amount student school three estimate rounded version exact count different precise estimate least precise estimate rounding number basically mean making less precise version see usually multiple ways round number depending level precision really good way understand going round number look number line want round nearest need decide goes want round nearest need decide goes want round nearest need decide goes case decision based round number closer original exact number might wondering would ever want make number less precise first place rounding good well rounding often make lot easier calculation like would lot easier quickly add would add sometimes need much precision like might need know dog weigh k g might precise enough like decimal irrational rounded keep writing decimal know rounding rest video going focus learning procedure follow round number remember number system based number digit number particular number place number place name according amount represent count sand important know whenever rounding number usually ked round specific number place example may ked round number nearest nearest might ked round number nearest tenth hundredth may even ked round nearest whole number another way round ked round number first step pay close attention number place need round number place important unit counting going keep rounded version number fact number place digit inside important going give special name video let call target rounding number mean making new less precise version new number number place smaller target automatically get zero sand case number place target automatically kept new rounded version exception see later video seem pretty simple bigger keep smaller zero target digit well going one two either going keep digit going increase keep target digit cal led rounding might seem strange first mean leaving digit rounding remember going automatically replace smaller place zero make rounded number smaller even target digit stays hand increasing target digit one cal led rounding since new rounded number original decide know keep target digit increase one key look digit next smaller number place digit right target digit digit less word leave target digit rounded version digit greater increase target digit know basic procedure rounding let try specific first one round nearest hundred since need round nearest hundred first need identify digit hundred digit target know right target rounded version next let decide target digit either keep increase one decide look value next digit right since digit less round mean keep target digit rounded number last keep bigger number place rounded rounded original number nearest hundred answer try another problem one decimal ked round nearest whole number mean target digit need round nearest one right place rounded version decide target digit look next digit right since digit round time mean increase target digit one finally keep left target digit case rounded number since really need extra decimal one let round nearest hundredth first step identify hundredth place target place contain digit smaller number place zero rounded version next need decide leave target digit increase one look digit right target also definitely rounding since target digit already raising little complicated add digit already need change increase digit next bigger number place one mean target digit become zero need increase digit next bigger number digit increase rest original number kept rounded version rounded version see case rounding actually change left target digit also sort domino effect happen rounding lot rounding bump like chain reaction like need round nearest place tell us need round target digit one already need zero increase next number place already need zero increase next number place already pattern continue end final rounded number sometimes rounding number pretty simple times little involved key remember rule digit right target less leave target digit increase target digit one even cause chain reaction bigger number know lot rounding know round seen basic procedure action watching video rounding enough get really good way practice sure try rounding fact rounding important math skill probably practice lot really got always thanks watching math antic see ya next time
