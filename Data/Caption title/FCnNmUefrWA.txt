okay let 's simply help my sensibilitiesas a mathematician and bring symmetryinto our lopsided story so farright now we have boxes we go as far tothe left as we please and we make senseof these boxes in fact if I tell youthis is a 10-1 machine let 's go back toprimary school per moment then we knowthese boxes represent what one doesabout the numbers ones and tens and ahundreds and thousands and so on off tothe leftbut I 'm worried about it being lopsidedso I 'm going to ask as mathematician canwe make this symmetrical curve boxesgoing as far to the right as we clean aswell well the answer is sure just makeit happen but the real question is whatcould these boxes going intially far tothe right actually mean now if I stickwith say 10 1 specifically right nowthen I know the meaning to the bottom tothe left and I know this machine worksby taking 10 dots in any one box andhaving them explode become one dot oneplace over so 10 ones makes 10 ten ofthese makes the next one ten tens 100and so on so if that 's the game of thismachine then these boxes must work thesame way as well that is ten dots inhere whatever they 're worth who knowswhat they 're worthmust together explode and become one ofthose so 10 of these explored Gaboonmessy messy messy is become one dotthere which is worth 110 or somethingbecomes one that tells me these dotshere must each be worth one tenth tenone tenth makes one now I 'm going to seewhat 's going on because ten of thesewhether they 're worth must togetherexplode to meet one of those 110 10watts to meet 110 110 100th make 110 10of these makes one of them 's onethousand ten one thousandth is 100 andso on I think I 've now given meaning tothe boxes off this direction as well asthat direction beautiful now people callthese decimals writing numbers in asymmetric machine like this we'rewriting numbers in decimal because endbased in in English the prefix decimeans 10 so that 's language specificallyfor the 10 by Machine if that 's becomestandard society to separate the decimalpart from the whole number part withsomething called a point well in thiscase called a decimal point in the 10-1language in a 2:1 machine I guess Iwould n't use the worddecimal that means 10 have to use theword walk by mall or something I don'tknow yeah we 'll stick with 10 months ornow there 's a decimal point so ifsomeone writes a number like two pointthree seven what they really mean is twodots in here they mean three dots inhere and they mean seven dots in hereand how do you interpret that as anactual number well what is it it 's a 3-1this is 2 plus 3 of these guys 3/10 plus7 of these guys plus 7one hundredths so actually a decimal isjust the expression in terms of theseparticular fractions tenth hundreds ofthousands and so on beautiful beautifulbeautiful beautiful if they advice wrotethe fraction I know three hundredthswell then clearly they 'll be just thispicturegood lord rudra clearing it here messymessy messy three dots in the hundredthsbox and there will be the decimal what0.03 0.03 some people like to write thezero in the front of the decimal pointsome people do n't just a star thing isall goodactually there 's one confusing pointhere I should say this clear the boxagain some people might say they writeto zero point three one you might saythis is 31 hundredths little Roger said31 hundredths which is actually littlestrange at first thought because pointthree one is literally this it 's 23three dots and one dot so technicallythis is 3/10 and 1/100 yet people willsay this is 31hundreds different language there thequestion is they say in the correctthings well of course they are but butwhy is these two different ways ofthinking actually equivalent so is 3/10and 1/100 the same as 31 hundredths wellactually yes because I unexploded thesedots cabal note wrong santa thing onetwo three four six seven eight nine tenthree four five six seven eight nine tenone two three four six seven eight nineten all right bingo three dots here onedot here is indeed equivalent to 31 dotshere it literally is 31 hundredths sosaying 31 hundredths is fine saying 3/10and one hundredths is fineallgood grant so I love this work this isreally super so we 've got decimalsbecome fractions getting fractions intodecimals is a little more delicate letme just make some space here on theboard excuse me one moment let 's cleansome space all right I 'm back made alittle bit of space up here so we wantto get some fractions now into decimalsI 've slowed how to get decimals back tofractions other way aroundlet me start with a fraction like 1/2now this is actually a bit delicate herebecause this was all set up to think interms of tenths hundreds of thousandsand so forth so the challenge is can Ithink of this fraction 1/2 in terms oftens hundreds of thousands whatever hmmso I 'm going to do is actually okay thedenominator batoo of the knowing I'dlight of one of these denominatorsplease so what I could do that ismultiply the bottom by 5 which gets abetter multiply the top by five as welldoing that gives me a bottom of 10 and atop of five so actually I now see thatone half the same as 5/10 five theseguys with five of them so actually I canwrite as a point five so that 's thetrickso some fraction is going to be amenableto doing this example I think 3/4 isalso a good one anyway you think aboutgetting done Nate denominator of either10 or 100 or thousand from that I can Ithink of multiplying by 25 and the topand the bottom keeps the fraction thesame so now see 75 one hundredths soit 's really so nice I love these guysand if you like I could do someexplosions to explore it and explode nexplode ten explode 1024 explodedleaving five behind seven dots thereit 's actually point seven five before Irun off the edge of the board all rightso some fractions are amenable towriting as decimals and other fractionshave a feeling under be bit awkward like313thhuh that seems like a topic for anotherlesson I bet there 's a way to handleeven those ones they will be coolyou test
