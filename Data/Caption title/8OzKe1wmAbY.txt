okay let 's explore division in a 10-1machine let me start off with thisproblem 3,900 6 divided by 3 in fact youprobably see what the answer is going tobe right with that it 's going to be what1 3 so 2 1302 but what it illustrateshow we actually see that answer I meanliterally see that answer in a 10-1machine so I 'm going to do is I willdraw a picture of three nine zero sixand ten my machine today so now I can dothatso P 3900 nodes tens and six onesthere 's a picture of three 906 andlooking for in that picture three groupsof three whatever you look like what itlooks like three dots all rightso question is can I see any groups ofthree in this picture of 3906 and theanswer is yes I see lots of groups ofthree for example I see one group ofthree right here at this 1000 level nowthat really is actually one thousandgroups because I did all the unexploitedto be one thousand groups of three therethey will just like explode over here soas one group of three at the thousandslevel but also actually three groups ofthree at the 100 level I just did tallymarks a member should write three sheleadership writes three this look reallyhappening one three do I see any groupsince we at that level know there 's anyscripts of three at this level yep Iseem to at that level which I shouldguess - - and look at that i c-130 - theanswers of the division problem Iliterally look for groups of three atdifferent levels in my ten my machine Ifound while it fails this level throughthe hundreds level none of the tenslevel to the ones level that is indeedthe answer one three zero to one of thethousand level three at hundreds levelzero the tens to it the onesgrand so that 's how division works inthe ten one machine just draw picturesNAB you 've got draw picture the groupsyou 're looking for and go hunt for themand a story kind of fun now this is anice one there was a single-digitdivision this do is sort of a morecomplicated one let 's say do say 276divided by 12 this makes a little morecomplicated now 12 it can be interestingfor us but let me show you 236 is finebut deadly draws pictures assit is what two dots 7 dots and 6 dotsand what does 12 look like all right 12is going to be think about 12 dots inthe box would explode and make one dotone place over and two dots left behindso mess is more interesting 3 wasobviously all in one box and I get 5groups of 3 but 12 is spilled over sowhat I 'm going to have to keep note ofis that actually all 12 dots are reallysitting in there the rightmost part ofthis picture and then just the explosionmust have occurred and then scroll bondover to next box over so I 'm going tokeep that in mind I 'm really doing thisbut 12 is a bit more complicated alittle explosion occurred so now thequestion is to 76 divided by 12 here 's apicture of 206 276 here 's a picture of12 can I find any pictures of 12 in thispicture up here well yes I 'm going forone dot next to two dots there 's one dotnext to two dots now be very carefulwhere are the actual 12 dots on thesolut well they must all be here in thiswhite most part of the explosion musthave curds actually got one group of 12at that level they 're at the tens leveljust like I had one group of three atthe hundreds level here longer than athousand level that 's what all thetwelve dots actually are and explosionmust have happened on the right mostpower loop where those twelve dotsactually are any more greater 12 why yesthere 's another one at that level soI 'll just do tally marks right now anymore grist for 12 in this picture whyyes go one level over C 1 dot X 2 2 dotsthere 1 dot next to 2 dots there 1 dotnext to 2 dots there I see two at thetens level three at the ones level I seethe answer 23 which is indeed correct toGrocer 12 tens three groups of 12 123groups of 12 in totalWow there it is I 've visually see it infact I 'm going to ask you just to keepthis particular picture in mind it'sgoing to come back to us later on youknow look at it for now that 's great solet 's do another example to show howlong division works with just pictures Ican really see what 's going on here asI 'll clean the board I 'll be back injust a momentall right board is cleaning that I amback so let 's do another long divisionexample let 's make it a really big onelet 's do 3 8 1 2 4 divided by 1 0through this time good and juicy allright here goesI 'll look for groups of 102 in a pictureof 3 8 1 2 4well let 's do a picture of 3 1 8 2 4 & a10-1 machine it will be 3 10 thousandone one thousand eight one hundred twotens and four one beautiful one happened- what does that look like now it'sgoing to be a bit of a big picture saidI 'm only actually physically - on threedots but really is a picture of onehundred two dots they must all be thereand lots of explosions happen to spillthem all the way over to two places tothe leftoh so there 's a picture of 100 - there'sa picture of three 182 four I 'm askinghow many groups of 102 can I find inthis picture I 'm looking for one dotzero dot two dots 102 in this picture ofthree eight one two four can I find someall right so I 'm looking for one blank -now that black is will those noise alittle bit hiccup for so they keep inmind you 've got a blank to deal with letme just get my blue pen can I see onegot no dots two dots anywhere thispicture yes I can see one right here 100or greatly long loop like thatone dot no dot two dots all right withinthat blue loop where all the hundred twodots really well with all the explosionsthey must be all right here mr. spoilerthis way they 're all at that levelthere 's one group of hundred two at thatlevel but some explosions occurredspilled over to the left all right anyother one blank - all right as you dothis you might find that drawing loopsget pretty messy so I might just skipdrawing loops can I do this can I doone dot no dot two dots that okaythere 's another one at that level thenbut I can do it again one dot no dot twodots so about three at that level rightnow alright how are we doing how are wedoing so farOh any more one blank - one dot two dotswell yes one dot no dots two dots onedot no dot two dots guys do a sort ofsplit loop now maybeat that level remember 102 dots reallyhere there must be in some explosionsbling over yonder all right so far sogood getting bit tricky this anymore Idoone dot no dot two dots those two thereand there 's one of that level one dotno dots two dots another one at thatlevel that 's all the dots accounted forand look we 've found a lot of groupshundred two in this picture that wefound three at the hundreds level one atthe tens level and two at the ones levelthe answer must be three one two we justdid long division purely with pictureshow gorgeous is that loads of funyou Lesson 5.2 of Exploding Dots Lesson 5.2 of Exploding Dots Lesson 5.2 of Exploding Dots
