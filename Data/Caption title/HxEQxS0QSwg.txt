Hi ! Welcome to Math Antics . In our last lesson about percents , we learned that there¡¯re three main types of percent problems because there¡¯s three different numbers that could be missing.Those three numbers are the ¡®part¡¯ , the ¡®total¡¯ , and the ¡®percent¡¯.They¡¯re just the three variable ( or changeable numbers ) in the percentage equation.The forth number is always 100 , since that¡¯s what percent means : per 100.In the last two videos , we learned how to solve problems where the ¡®part¡¯ was unknown and where the ¡®percent¡¯ was unknown.In this video , we¡¯re gon na learn how to solve problems where the ¡®total¡¯ is unknown or missing.With this type of problem , you¡¯ll be told what the percent is , and you¡¯ll be told what part of the total you have.But you¡¯ll need to figure out what that total itself is.Here¡¯s an example of a problem like that : Your friend has a bag of marbles , and he tells you that 20 % of the marbles are red.If there¡¯s 7 red marbles , how many marbles does he have altogether ? Okay , so how do you know that it¡¯s the total that¡¯s missing in this problem ? Well , the word ¡°altogether¡± is a big clue because it means almost the same thing as ¡°total¡±.So , if the question has words like , ¡°altogether¡± , or ¡°in all¡± , or ¡°total¡± , or ¡°whole¡± , or ¡°entire¡±those can help you know that you need to find the total.And another way that we can tell is by the numbers that we ARE given.In this problem , we know that the percent is 20 , and we¡¯re also told that PART of the marbles are red , so we know that the PART is 7.So that means that it must be the total that¡¯s missing ! Alright then , so how do we figure out what the total is ? Well , using a little algebra ( which you don¡¯t need to know how to do right here ) we can re-arrange our percent equation like this : What this new form of the equation tells us is that , if we take the ¡®part¡¯ and multiply it by 100 , and then we divide that by the ¡®percent¡¯ , we¡¯ll get the ¡®total¡¯.That seems simple enough . It¡¯s just two steps ! Let¡¯s try it out on our word problem about the marbles.We know that the ¡®part¡¯ ( that are red ) is 7 , so step one is to just multiply that part by 100.7 ¡Á 100 is 700.And in step two , we take that 700 and divide it by the ¡®percent¡¯ , which we¡¯re told is 20.Okay , 700 divided by 20¡­ . hmmm¡­.Well , we could use a calculator to divide , but this doesn¡¯t seem too hard , so I¡¯ll just do the division the long way.20 is to big to divide into the first digit ( 7 ) so we¡¯ll need to include the digit next to it as well.Now we ask , ¡°How many ¡¯20¡¯s does it take to make 70 or almost 70¡±.That would be 3 because 3 ¡Á 20 is 60.70 minus 60 leaves 10 as the remainder.And then we bring down the zero and then we ask , ¡°How many ¡¯20¡¯s will divide into 100 ? ¡±Ah-ha¡­ 5 , because 5 ¡Á 20 is 100 , so that leaves no remainder.So 700 divided by 20 is 35.And that means that the total number of marbles is 35.And in a problem like this , you can always check your answerby making sure that the fraction of the ¡®part¡¯ over the ¡®total¡¯ would give you the correct percent.For example , in this case , you could make sure that the fraction 7 over 35 would really be 20 % .Now that wasn¡¯t so tough , was it ? Let¡¯s see one more example to make sure you¡¯ve got the procedure down before you try some on your own.The next problem says : A high school marching band has 12 flute players . [ frantic flute music ] If 8 % of the band members play the flute , then how many members are in the entire band ? Okay , so the smaller ¡®part¡¯ in this problem is 12 since there¡¯s 12 flute players.And we¡¯re told that they make up 8 percent of the band , so the ¡®percent¡¯ is 8.Again , it¡¯s the ¡®total¡¯ that¡¯s missing , and to find it , we just need to follow our 2-step procedure.For step one , we multiply the ¡®part¡¯ by 100:12 ¡Á 100 = 1,200For step two , we divide that 1,200 by the percent , which is 8 . ( This time I think I¡¯ll use a calculator to divide . ) 1,200 divided by 8 equals 150.Great¡­ that means that the total number of band members is 150.And again , you can always check your answer the way we did in the last example.Alright¡­ that does it for this lesson.Remember¡­ the key to getting really good at math is to do it yourself.Doing practice problems on your own will help you become a great problem solver.Good luck !
