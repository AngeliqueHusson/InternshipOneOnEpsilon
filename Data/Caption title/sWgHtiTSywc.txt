hi boys and girls in this lesson we'regoing to learn how to identify convexand concave polygons all right let 's getstartedso convex polygons convex polygons arepolygons in which all the sides arepushed outward so let 's take a look atthis hexagon here so if you notice youcan see all the sides are pushed outwardno one is being pushed inward or towardthe interior the shape they 're allpushed toward the exterior of the shapeso if we look at the square same thingall the sides have been pushed outwardin triangle same thing all the sideshave been pushed outward and then wehave finally a Pentagon and all thesides are pushed outward okay so convexa polygon in which all the sides arepushed outward all right the secondpiece to this is our concave polygonsthey 're also known as non convex so youmight see them in textbooks or in otherthings we do in class they'reinterchangeable they 're concave polygonsand non convex polygons for both talkingabout the same thing and so non convexor concave polygon is a polygon in whichat least two sides are pushed in solet 's take a look at this see how thisside is pushed in so it 's pushed intothe interior of the shape so this wouldbe an example of a concave or non convexpolygon here we have another one see howit 's been pushed in to the shape it'sbeen pushed in to the interior of theshape and here we have one last one it'sbeen pushed in to the shape okay a goodway to remember this is think about ifyou build a snow dome or if you build asnow fort and the roof caves in do yousee how your if your roof is up here andit caves theand okay that 's a nice way to rememberanother mnemonic device to help youremember all right let 's do a quickreview we have two really importantwords today we have convex polygonsthey 're convex polygon is a polygon inwhich all the sides are pushed outwardokay so they 're all pushed outnothing is caved in on a convex polygonalright next is concave polygons alsoknown as non convex so you could sayconcave aka non convex polygons andthey 're polygons in some inch at leasttwo sides are pushed inward push towardthe interior of the shapeokay so pushed in pushed in all rightthose are two important words thatyou 're going to need to know fortomorrow 's lesson tomorrow we 're goingto be talking about all the propertiesof polygons and this will be one thingthat we 'll also be talking about concaveand convex polygons all right so to beprepared for tomorrow 's class here'swhat I want you to do take astraightedge any straightedge you havehanging around your house and a scrappiece of paper it can be the back ofsomething it does n't matter and what Iwant you to do is use a straight edge todraw a convex polygon and a concavepolygon and I want you to bring yourdrawing to class with you tomorrow andwe will be talking more about theproperties of polygons in class allright I hope you have a nice night andI 'll see you all in the morning Convex and Concave Polygons Convex and Concave Polygons Convex and Concave Polygons
