We have three lines and we have to figure out which ofthe three are parallel.So line A -- and it ca n't be parallel on its own , it has tobe parallel to another of the three lines.So the equation for line A is y is equalto 3/4 x minus four.Line B is 4y minus 20 is equal to negative 3x.And then line C is negative 3x plus 4y is equal to 40.So to figure out if any of these lines are parallel toany of the other lines , we just have tocompare their slopes.If any two of these lines have the same slope and they'redifferent lines , they have different y-intercepts , thenthey 're going to be parallel.Now line A , it 's very easy to figure out its slope.It 's already in slope-intercept form.This is mx plus b , the slope is 3/4 and the y-intercept , which is n't as relevant when you 're figuring out parallellines , is negative 4.So let 's see what the other character 's slopes are.This is n't in any kind of standard form.It 's not a standard form , slope-intercept , orpoint-slope form , but let's see what the slopeof this line is.So to get it into slope-intercept form , which isreally the easiest one to pick out the slope from , let 's add20 to both sides of this equation.The left-hand side , those cancel out , that was the wholepoint , you get 4y is equal to negative 3x plus 20.And now we can divide everything by 4.We are left with y is equal to negative 3/4 x plus 5.So in this case , y-intercept is 5 , but most importantly , the slope is negative 3/4 , so it 's different than this guy.This is negative 3/4 , this is positive 3/4 , so these twoguys definitely aren't parallel.Let 's move on of this guy in standard form.So let 's get the x term on the other side.So let 's add 3x to both sides of this equation.Left-hand side , these cancel out.We 're just left with 4y is equal to 3x plus 40 , or 40plus 3x , either way.Now we can divide both sides by 4 you have to divideevery term by 4.The left-hand side , you're left with y.The right-hand side , you have 3/4 x plus 10.So here , our slope is 3/4 and our y-intercept , if we careabout it , is 10.So this line and this line have the exact same slope,3/4 , and they 're different lines because theiry-intercept is different.So we know that A and C are parallel lines and B is notparallel to either one of the other two .
