Okay , here 's a story that 's not true.When I was a child I invented a machine.Not true.And all my machine was was a row of boxes.And these boxes would go as far to the left as ever I desired.Now , being a precocious child , I gave this machine a very strange name.I called it a two-one machine but in a funny backward way.But , I was a young child , I knew no different.Okay , great.So what you do with this machine is you put in dots.So I put in one dot.In fact , dots will always go in the right most box , I get zoom¡ªWell , I get one dot , it 's not very exciting.However , put in a second dot in the machine , always the right most box , zoom¡ªThen something exciting happens because whenever there are two dots in a box , they explode , kaboom , and are replaced by one dot , one place to the left.Hence the name two-one machine.Get it ? All right , so our two dots looks like this picturewhich I 'm going to write as nothing , nothing , nothing , nothing , one dot , zero dots.So the code for two in a two-one machine is now one , zero.All right , here comes a third dot.Always in the right most box ? Zoom.So what 's the code for three ? One , one.All right , four.I have a feeling putting in a fourth dot is going to be particularly exciting.Here goes.Here it comes , right most box . Zoom.Two dots in a box¡ªkapow ! Dot.Ah ! Again ! Kaboom ! Dot.Wow.So what 's the code for four ? Nothing , nothing , nothing , one dot , zero dot , zero dots.Bingo.Can you see what the code for five is going to be ? Zoom . One , zero , one.How about six , can you see what the code for six is going to be ? Zoom . Kapow ! Dot.One , one , zero.Great . Your turn.Thirteen.What 's the code for the number thirteen in a two-one machine ? I 've skipped some numbers , watch out.Okay , there 's something to think about.Play with it for a while.We 'll definitely give the answer away in a later video but try for yourself right now.Hours of fun to be had with a two-one machine .
