hi this is Mario with Mario 's mathtutoring come at you to another mathvideo to help you boost your score inyour math class improve yourunderstanding and hopefully makelearning math a lot less stressful sowhat we 're going to talk about in thisvideo is what 's the difference betweenthe decay factor the decay rate thegrowth factor and the growth rate solet 's get right into this video you'reprobably working on this in your mathclass right now and you 're wondering youknow what 's the difference between thesedifferent terms well you 're probablyworking with this formula a equals p1plus or minus R to the T power andbasically what this is it 's a formulafor when something is growingexponentially or decaying exponentiallyP is the starting amount so that'swhatever the beginning amount is 1represents like a hundred percent theoriginal amount okay what you'rebeginning with then if you 're increasingsomething is going up okay you 're goingto be adding the rate okay R and ifyou 're something 's going down you'regoing to be subtracting the rate so it'sgoing to be decreasing and then T is thetime usually it 's in years but it couldbe months days you know etc so R that'sthe rate so that 's the growth rate orthe decay rate using your problems aregonna say it 's growing at 5 % per yearand you want to take that percentagepoint zero five you want it to convertit to a decimal so from five percent youknow two point zero five same thing ifit 's decaying you know you 're gon na wantto also convert that into a decimal solet me show you an example and I 'll showyou how this problem plays out here sosay for example you have a car and let'sjust say the car is thirty thousanddollars okay and say that every year itactually loses value at the rate of 20percent per year so 20 percent okay youjust want to convert this to a decimalby moving the decimal point two placesto the left so that 's point two zero andbecause it 's decreasing we 're gon na besubtracting point two zero now if wesimplify this further you can see thisis going to be point eight zero to the Tand we 're starting with 30,000 so if youwant to find out how much the car isgonna be worth in say five years we putin 540 and we simplify butyou can see because this base is lessthan one it 's going to be decreasingthis is a an exponential decay functionit 's gon na be going down down down likethis okay it 's gon na be approaching zeronow if you had a classic-car say forexample the classic car was twentythousand dollars but say for example itwas going up in value by ten percentevery yearokay classic car so that 's ten percentpoint one zero to the T now when yousimplify you can see this is one pointone zero to the T and you can see thatbecause that base is greater than oneyou 're going to be continuallymultiplying by one point one zero it'sgoing to be increasing increasing thisis going to be an exponential growthfunction it 's going to be going up astime continues so the last thing I wantto mention to you aside from you knowthe decay rate and the growth rate isthis concept of the decay factor in thegrowth factor and all that means iswhatever 's in parentheses here that 's afactor okay that 's the whole entiregroup so when we look at this one pointone zero that 's the growth factor weknow it 's growth because it 's greaterthan one the point eight zero you cansee that 's less than one we know that'sthe decay factor so if somebody givesyou a problem like this and says okaywhat 's the rate of decay you 're thinkingabout what 's the percentage either aboveor below one so if they were giving youthis problem like this you 'd say well Ican see that 's 0.2 zero so if I convertthat point to zero into a percentagetwenty percent that 's my decay rate sothe rate is you know the percentage andthen the 1 plus or minus the rate thatwhole quantity in parentheses that 's thegrowth factor or the decay factor sohopefully that cleared some questions upthat you may have had regarding thistopic go ahead and subscribe to thechannel check out some of my past videosand I look forward to seeing you in thefuture ones I 'll talk to you soon What is Decay Factor, Decay Rate, Growth Factor, Growth Rate?
