g'day welcome to the tech math Channelall you were doing this video is goingto be looking at metric units units oflength and we 're going to look at abouthow to convert between these now this isgoing to present some difficulty becauseobviously we 're going to be talkingabout units of length you are all goingto be having different size computerscreens and things like this so it'ssort of it 's silly if I just put up arule in so this is how big they are eventhough I have got to rule it in thereso I really really recommend when you dothis you get yourself a tape measure andyou have a look at this now first offI 'm just going to go through the basicunit of length so the most basic unit oflength is a meter now a meter will writethis down here and stuff like thiswe have a meter and the symbol for thisis just an M okayso you might say 4m which is 4 metersnow meter is a roundaboutsay say we had a car or say somethinglike this if I had a carit 'll be roundabout for a standard sizedcar and I know all cars sort of vary insize we 'd be looking a meters probablyaround about this height here okay ormaybe for some people here for a lot ofpeople usually a me to recite thedistance that they step okay so ifyou 're walking along say for a fairlybig sidestep I do n't usually the drop ordraw me then usually that fair sizedstep there is about one meterokay so let 's go keep that one in mindand that 's the the most basic unit ofmeasurement so I 'll get that and I'llleave it there for the minute andbasically if you get a meter and you geta thousand meters a thousand steps okayso if we get a thousand of these times athousand of these meterstake a thousand steps you end up withwhat 's is known as a kilometer kilometerare usually actually thinking about thatit 's about the distance of a thousandsteps fair-sized steps it 's also thedistance so we do use to actuallymeasure distance between cities and thatsort of deal 4000 of these meters iscalled a kilometer we write that istight m and here we go the other way wecan divide we can divide liters up in toa hundred partsand we end up with what is known as acentimeter you know a centimeter and Iam in a row right it 's that you knowsecond a centimeter if you ever seenthose rulers maybe you have maybehave n't they look a little bit likethese ones here you see the old markingeach on how it 's about two and a halfcentimeters each one of these is acentimeter but a centimeter is usuallyrather less these with footlong sort ofrules are there 30 centimeter rules alot of the time okay so centimetersabout the width say of a box of matchesor say a you know a teenager 's book sortof thing so this is about one centimeterokay and the way we write this is cmagain I really recommend you have a lookat these on a tape measure now you candivide centimeters up into ten parts andwe end up with what is known as amillimeter a millimeternow millimeter is probably the smallestof the most typical types of Units weusually get into nanometers andmicrometers and light sort of deal we'rejust going to go into millimeters andthese but you know seven aurora each oneof these little spots here is amillimeter so when you see them theylook about the width of say a a smalland the length of a small angle saysomething like that okay baby they eventhe width of a mapokay actually a with the match 's polyseveral millimeters some of they'requite small as you probably get the ideaso ten of these in a centimeter is 100centimeters in the mela as a thousandmeters in a kilometer so let me writethat out in a usable way and this is theway that I 'd recommend that you rememberthey say first off it 's a really reallygood thing you need to remember thosedifferent units and I 'll show you how Iwould actually remember these now I'mjust going to write the symbols down todo this so say we start with kilometresthe biggest ones firstthen we have a thousand of these one twothree then we have meters we have ahundred these one two we havecentimeters and ten of those and we havemillimeters okay now I 'm going to drawthese thousand but I 'm not going to drawthem as zeros I actually draw them asjumps so one two three there 's athousand of them okay and the meterscentimeters there 's a hundred so that'stwo jumps two zeros one to every zeroI 'm drawing a jump and four centimetresto millimetres cuz it 's only ten I'mgonna draw one jump okay so you can seethree to one as you go down now this isa really really handy little way ofworking these out just remember biggestto smallest and then this straight toone you should be able to use this toconvert between two units of length okayso you do n't remember these exact Hamadybecause this will come to you prettysoon after using this now I 'll give youan example this say I want to know howmany centimeters forty millimeters wellokay that equals how many centimeterswell I get 40and I 'm going to go from this oneSante means the action I 'll go frommillimeters to centimeters I 'm goingfrom this one to this one go from hereto here as you sound jumping this wayone time so at the end of this numberthere 's a decimal place unless it'sgiven there 's a decimal place at the endof this number we jump one time so onetime this place will end up there okayso this is a decimal place is going toend up between the 4 and 0 here so esactually rises for if you really makesure for reducing writers 4.0 from theminute but they mean the same thing sothere 's 4 centimeters equals is the sameas 40 millimeters okay see how to usethis all right whatever give you anotherone what about we do say I have a lookat that in five kilometers and I want toknow how many meters that art is nowthere 's a thousand meters in a kilometerso you might be able to work this outbut I 'm going to work it out using thistable here because we 're going fromkilometers and we only one two three twometers okay so we 're going this way onetwo three okay so five and we go thisway one two three okay let 's do thatI 'll even draw the little jumps behindone two three and under those I 'm goingto draw zeros okay the decimal place isgoing to end up there again so we hadfive thousand pages and that makes sensebecause one kilometer is a thousandmeters so two kilometers is 2,000 litersand five kilometers is 5,000 millionsokay let 's go another one I 'm going todo two more all together so what aboutwe have a look about 100 second rightwe 'll have a look at cuz I 'm gon na runout that one 195 centimeters and I'vechosen that one because it 's Hawaiianyou might have measure yourself and seehow many centimeters you are and thenconvert this to say millimeters ormeters or even kilometers probably dyesuseful doing kilometers but I want toknow how many meters I am okay nowwhen we go from centimeters to meterswe 're going from this one to this oneand we 're going to jump one two times soon this hundred ninety five the decimalbase maybe I 'd see is at the end then wejust start drawing on and we 're jumpingone two times that way one two so thedecimal place ends up here this is 1.95meters or we might even call that onemeter and ninety five centimeters yousee how it is so imma actually ran aboutjust almost two meters okay I am prettytall you might be out looking oh oh Imay be looking at Jesus pretty sure Ido n't know I do n't know how tall you areokay let 's uh do one last one and todaywe 're going to change this time I'mgoing to change from say what about achange from one point four zero onemeters and I want to change this intomillimeters but I 've chosen this one fora reason that 's because we 're actuallygoing to we 're going from meters tomillimeters and it 's actually inmultiple jumps do you see that so we'reto go from millimeters to centimeterstwo millimeters to centimeters twomillimeters you can see this you don'tneed to actually then change incentimeters in changing elements and seehow many in total we jumped we 're goingwe 're going to be chopping this way wegot a decimal place here so we do n't I'mjust going to write it down here we'regoing to use this decimal place and seehow many types of jobs jumping in thisdirection you can see there 's jumpingone two three times so one two three thedecimal place ends up here so this is1401you 're going to see the order thenumbers stays the same okay and this iscorrect this is actually how manymillimeters there are in one point fourzero one meters so hopefully that was asome help to you I think it 's a reallyreally handy with a way of convertingbetween these and especially you knoweven start you 're getting stuck with ajust remember biggest the smallest andthen there 's three to one idea anywayhopefully that was some help we 'll seeyou next time test
