g day welcome tech math channel video going looking metric length going look convert going present difficulty obviously going talking length going different size thing like sort silly put big got rule really really recommend get tape measure look first going go basic unit length basic unit length meter meter write stuff like meter symbol might say meter snow meter roundabout say say car say roundabout standard sized car know car sort vary size wed looking probably around height maybe people lot people usually recite distance step walking along say fairly big side step dont usually drop draw usually fair sized step one let go keep one thats basic unit measurement ill get ill leave minute basically get meter geta thousand thousand step get thousand times thousand meter stake thousand step end whats known kilometer kilometer usually actually thinking distance fair sized step also distance use actually measure distance deal scalled kilometer write tight go way divide divide toa hundred part sand end known centimeter know centimeter row right know second centimeter ever seen ruler maybe maybe havent look little bit like see old marking two one centimeter centimeter usually rather less foot long sort centimeter rule time width say box say know book sort thing one way write really recommend tape measure divide centimeter ten part end known millimeter millimeter millimeter probably typical type usually get light sort deal going go millimeter know seven aurora one little spot millimeter see look width say small length small angle say something like baby width mapo kay actually match poly several millimeter small probably get idea ten centimeter mela kilometer let write usable way id recommend remember say first really really good thing need remember different ill show would actually remember going write symbol say start biggest first thousand one two three hundred one two ten going draw thousand going draw actually draw one two three theres thousand theres hundred thats two jump two one every drawing jump four ten draw one jump see three one go really really handy little way working remember biggest straight able use convert two length dont remember exact come pretty soon ill give example say want know many centimeter forty millimeter equal many centimeter swell get going go mean action ill go centimeter going one one go hereto sound jump ing way one time end number theres decimal place unless given theres decimal place end number jump one time onetime place end decimal place going end es actually rise really make sure reducing minute mean thing theres centimeter equal millimeter see use right whatever give another one say five kilometer want know many art theres thousand kilometer might able work going work table going one two three going way one two three five go way one two three let even draw little jump behind one two three going draw decimal place going end five thousand page make sense one kilometer two kilometer liter sand five kilometer let go another one going two together look second right well look gon na runout one centimeter one might measure see many centimeter convert say millimeter even kilometer probably kilometer want know many go centimeter going one one going jump one two times soon hundred ninety five decimal base maybe id see end start drawing two times way one two decimal place end might even call one meter ninety five centimeter actually ran almost two pretty tall might looking oh oh may looking pretty sure dont know dont know tall let u h one last one today going change time change say change one point four zero want change chosen one fora reason thats actually going going actually multiple jump see go millimeter millimeter centimeter see dont need actually change element see many total going going chopping way got decimal place dont going write going use decimal place see many type job jump ing direction see theres two three times one two three decimal place end going see order stays correct actually one point four zero one hopefully help think really really handy way converting especially know even start getting stuck remember biggest theres three one idea anyway hopefully help well see next time converting measurement metric distance made easy converting measurement metric distance made easy converting measurement metric distance made easy converting measurement metric distance made easy converting measurement metric distance made easy converting measurement metric distance made easy converting measurement metric distance made easy converting measurement metric distance made easy converting measurement metric distance made easy converting measurement metric distance made easy converting measurement metric distance made easy converting measurement metric distance made easy
