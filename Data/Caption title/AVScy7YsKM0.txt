imagine an actor was asked to imitateyou for a day they need to do all thethings you do behave the way you do andthe only research you can provide as abook that gives them to know how to actexactly like you what would you write inthis book listing facts about yourselfwo n't be enough in order for the actorto imitate you you 'd need to record howyou do things we call this proceduralknowledge or knowing how and when wewrite down procedural knowledge we endup with what 's called an algorithm analgorithm is a sequence of instructionsfor how to do things throughout historywe 've communicated our know-how throughstorytelling at first these stories wereshared orally starting with the earliestforms of painting people depictedstories as images of things happeningacross time at first we did this withpicture sequences and later lettersequences but we can think of the keystages in a story as steps and this isthe basis of algorithmic thinking theability to break how we do things into astep-by-step procedure in the most basicform an algorithm is just a linearsequence of steps a single pathway ofaction but now think of something morecomplex that you do which ca n't beeasily expressed as a simple list ofsteps when you try writing down thesteps for how you do these complexthings you 'll notice you wo n't followthe same linear pathway each time thereis a conditional future practically thismeans the word if will pop up in yourlist of steps and every time we say ifit means our pathway of action willbranch into possible futuresno matter how far back you look in ourwritten records you will find if thenpairings used to describe our knowledgeabout the world early records of omenswere messages from the gods about thefuture for example in ancient Greece itwas believed that the gods madedecisions in an assembly concerning thecourse of the world 's affairs and thefate of human beings and they deliveredthese predictions about the future inthe form of omens for example they aretypically structured as if followed by asign in the natural world and thenfollowed by the resulting event acrosscultures ancient documents have beendiscovered which contain lists of omensthat people could consult to betterunderstand the fate of their livesand they can be viewed as an early formof science or proto science an attemptto describe the worldso it 's these if-then statements or whatwe call conditional statements that willhelp you define the complex things youdo and with that we have everything weneed to define algorithms algorithms areone a sequence of steps and to thesesteps can contain conditional statementsand you can describe anything that isdescribable using just these twoconcepts no matter how an algorithm isrun a human actor following instructionsor computer following machine code atsome level it 's understood to befollowing discrete steps resulting in apathway of execution and each step inthis pathway takes some amount of timeso the expected number of steps it takesa process to finish defines the timeresource or time complexity of analgorithm and while a machine or humanis following or running an algorithm itmay need to store or retrieveinformation which must be recorded inmemory and memoryno matter the form takes some amount ofspace for example when you follow thesteps in the algorithm formultiplication or long division atcertain steps you need to write downextra numbers that allow you to arriveat the answer these extra numbers arethe memory resource of those algorithmsand the total amount of memory neededmeasured as the number of symbolsdefines the space resource or spacecomplexity of an algorithm so when werun any algorithm no matter what itdescribes it results in some pathway ofaction and in the modern study ofalgorithms we always come back to twobig questions one how much time andspace does it needand to how can we be sure that theoutput of our algorithm is correctbecause anytime we hit a conditionalstatement before we can take our nextstep we 'll need to confirm at some levelif something is true or not but how dowe ever really know if something is trueor false and this requires some form oflogic do n't suppose for a moment atleast I do n't I am not naive enough tosuppose that the International BusinessMachines Corporation made this machineto play checkers it made this machine asa working model of decision makingmachines such machines could conceivablybe used to play other games thancheckers the business game the raw gamethe game of determining when to pressthe button for Armageddon for thethermonuclear waryou test
