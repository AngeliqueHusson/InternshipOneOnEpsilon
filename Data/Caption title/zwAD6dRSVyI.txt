math sometimes real tease us beauty reasoning geometrically two three dimension really nice pair triplet spatial stuff visual cortex good process ing example think circle radius one centered origin effect every possible pair x satisfy certain numerical property usefulness lot fact look opaque purely analytic context become quite clear geometrically honestly channel direct beneficiary back forth since rich library special category cleverness involve connect ing two seemingly disparate n mean general back forth pair triplet spatial reasoning mean specific one sum square circle sphere heart video made showing pi connected number theory one showing visualize possible triple also underlie video theorem used solve basically counting puzzle topological fact sphere doubt ability frame analytic fact geometrically useful math tease start question quadruplet quintuplet constraint physical space seem constrained intuition geometry lose back forth mean completely reasonable imagine problem would clever illuminating solution knew conceptualize say list individual point space mathematician computer scientist physicist problem framed term list list three regular part job standard approach actually math higher dimension use two three dimension analogy fundamentally reason thing analytically somewhat analogous pilot primarily instrument sight flying cloud want offer hybrid purely geometric purely analytic view method making analytic reasoning little visual way generalize arbitrarily high dimension drive home value tactic like want share famous example two three dimension help something extremely counter intuitive happen higher dimension hope though show help make phenomenon intuitive focus throughout higher dimensional sphere example talk four dimensional sphere say radius centered origin actually set quadruplet x z w sum square pictured multiple three dimensional slice sphere back three dimension even wrap head around push es question back would think sphere importantly squinting understand projection like reflective math sphere actually entail instead basic idea get literal think four separate like picture vertical number represent number configuration point space quadruplet mean unit sphere centered origin sum square four value goal understand movement correspond movement sphere help knock thing two dimension actually see circle ask nice way think relation well like think value real estate belonging x likewise value real estate belonging total unit real estate share moving around circle correspond constant exchange real estate two variable part reason choose term let us make useful analogy real estate cheap near zero expensive away zero see consider starting position zero meaning x real estate usual geometric picture mean right point circle move x bit value effect given real estate increase amount move entire away zero four times amount x move word x change little give expensive real estate could move lot gain value cheap real estate term usual circle drawing correspond steep slope near right side small nudge x allow big change moving forward let add tick mark indicate real estate look like point much would x change value walk around circle trade value give piston looking dance motion moving slowly away real estate expensive region tick mark cover per unit distance also nice side effect term real estate align naturally fact comes distance squared square root total real estate among give us distance origin unit sphere dimension set triplet x z sum square add third slider z three still one unit real estate share get feel imagine holding x place real estate mean z move around piston dance motion saw trade remain ing real estate term typical way sphere correspond slicing sphere along plane x looking circle formed choice z sphere increase value x amount real estate left z smaller constrained piston dance like circular slice smaller eventually x reach es value real estate left reach singularity point z forced feeling bit like bug surface sphere unable see whole sphere instead sitting single point sense local movement dimension higher lose crutch global view spatial visual fundamental rule real estate exchange remain fix one slider place watch three trade basically mean take slice sphere get small sphere much way fixing one three dimensional case give us circular slice remain ing two free vary watching move thinking real estate exchange pretty fun run risk aimless unless actual high dimensional puzzle sink teeth let set aside moment bring classic example something seem reasonable even dull two three dimension totally whack higher dimension start take box centered origin around vertices draw four circle radius one centered four vertices one tangent two neighbor want think circle centered origin large enough touching corner circle tangent one want setup higher dimension find radius inner circle two dimension use theorem see distance origin corner box square root two around subtract portion radius corner circle definition mean radius inner circle square root minus surprise seem pretty reasonable something analogous three dimension draw x x cube whose vertices gon na take eight different sphere radius one center vertices one tangent three neighbor think sphere centered origin large enough barely touching eight corner sphere start thinking distance origin corner box say corner way guess still n yet explicitly said way distance work higher dimension always add square component direction take square root never seen follow theorem two dimensional case actually really fun puzzle think left relevant image screen want want pause ponder anyway case distance origin corner square root square root radius inner sphere going quantity minus radius corner sphere definition seem like reasonable radius inner sphere happen inner radius increase dimension obviously reason bring something surprising happen might see going actually n want feel like surprise fun wow people counter intuitive fact math goal genuine understanding shock higher dimension get gut feel going since kind different way thing help get running start looking back analyze two three dimensional case context first thing first think circle centered corner like well previously circle centered origin amount real estate belonging x dependent distance number basic idea move around center real estate might dependent distance number circle centered amount real estate belonging x square distance likewise real estate belonging square distance negative looking feel piston dance trade completely simplicity focus one circle one centered ask mean find circle centered origin large enough tangent guy thinking term well notice point tangency happen x phrase differently point corner circle close st origin real estate evenly x important later let really dig think true imagine perturbing point slightly maybe moving x little closer mean would move little away change x would little smaller change since real estate gains moving farther away expensive real estate lose getting closer perspective origin point trade reversed resulting change smaller resulting change since real estate measured respect move towards expensive one mean slight perturbation away point real estate evenly result increasing distance origin reason care point tangent inner circle also think point inner circle useful higher dimension give us reference point understanding radius inner circle specifically ask much real estate x point real done respect origin example two dimension x dip configuration total value going less halfway point really going come handy wrapping mind around happen higher dimension taking thing one step time let bump three dimension consider corner sphere radius centered point sphere close st origin correspond configuration x z reaching toward equal go little beyond halfway point position account real estate three getting unit real estate need farther since point corner sphere tangent inner sphere also point inner sphere reference origin think amount real estate x z position corresponding tangent point definitely less since three smaller one less real estate sit back feel comfortable result right inner sphere smaller corner sphere thing get interesting move four dimension box going vertices possible binary combination mean sphere centered one tangent four focus ing one one centered point sphere close st origin correspond configuration four reach exactly halfway one away real estate respect point trick thinking point inner sphere measuring thing respect origin already see cool four dimension switch thinking real estate respect still case four real estate making total four word inner sphere precisely size corner sphere match es see numerically way compute distance origin corner square root four subtract radius one sphere get something much satisfying seeing rather particular cool aspect fact inner sphere radius one move thing around real estate goes x end point point actually touching box stuck thinking two three dimensional case fact inner sphere radius one size corner sphere touch es box well seem big important realize fundamentally four dimensional phenomenon ca n cram smaller dimension thing get weird er let knock five dimension case quite corner sphere total simplicity thinking one centered think point sphere close st origin five equally splitting one unit time little higher reach one would real estate giving total much tables turned view point inner sphere respect origin configuration much one unit real estate every away zero number dimension mean total real estate add specifically compute radius inner sphere intuitive feel mean roam territory single unit real estate would allow one fun way see mean adjust everything real estate goes one reach beyond seeing five dimensional inner sphere actually poke outside box really get feel strange thing become last example want jump ten dimension remember mean point ten sphere radius one single unit real estate must among ten always point corner sphere close st origin one ten split real estate evenly really see far away origin phrase differently inner sphere large amount real estate fact compute radius inner sphere vie wed perspective tenfold mention share real estate n actually feel somewhat reasonable inner sphere radius twice big corner sphere get sense big inner sphere look back two dimension imagine box bounding four circle outside go three dimension imagine box bounding corner sphere outside way ten dimension inner sphere actually large enough poke outside outer bounding box since diameter bigger four know seem crazy realize face box always two away origin matter high dimension fundamentally involve moving along single axis point inner sphere radius actually really far away center way dimension dimension add full unit real estate point course keep upping dimension inner sphere keep growing without bound poking outside box es proportion inner sphere lying inside box decrease exponentially towards zero dimension keep increasing taking step back one thing like slider method teaching friend way star ted talk higher dimension came little less metaphysical star ted sound like would hear mathematician talk topic rather skeptically whether dimensional space real thing exactly real people would actually probe high dimensional sphere feel like term box situation one number thing feel crazy higher dimensional sphere really fun think context real estate obviously limited mean bug surface object getting feel one point time rule movement also geometry quite nice free opposite give foothold thinking high dimensional little concretely could say thing different thinking thing purely analytically mean honestly little represent ing literally kind obvious thing might small move make much possible play thought high dimensional point even little thing like thinking square real estate shed light seemingly strange aspect high dimension like far away corner box center anything fact direct representation purely analytic description exactly make faithful reflection genuinely math higher dimension entail still flying cloud trusting instrument analytic reasoning redesign instrument one better take advantage fact large portion brains goes towards image process ing mean ca n visualize something n mean ca n
