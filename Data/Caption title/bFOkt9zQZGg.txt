g'day welcome to Tech math Channel whatwe 're going to be having a look at inthis video is factorials what are theseguys or these you would have seen beforeprobably written like this or maybeyou 've just seen the special button onyour calculator so that they 're thingslike the five factorial here and whatthey are is pretty much where you'regetting every number every whole numberbelow the number of five five four threetwo one and you 're multiplying to findthe product of this okay so five timesfour times three times two times one iswhat five factorial is okay R which isequal to 120 and these guys are used awhole lot when we 're looking atcombinations and permutations also alittle bit in algebra as well and whatare they well pretty much at its mostbasic you have if you could imagine fivedifferent things we could arrange them120 different ways so it 's an expressionof how many different ways we can orderthis many objects okay so if you were tosay there is n objects and factorialwould be the number of ways you canactually order these so by the way youalso have our this one which is zerofactorial just going to mention thisright now zero factorial is equal to oneand this is going to throw you a littlebit because you 're going to wait what'szero what how would you even write thatthis is just one of the things I 'm notgoing to get too much in the explanationoh I 've heard this explained as how manydifferent ways could you order thenumber zero Euler order as an empty setand you 'd only have one way of doing itbut the mainly where we really worryabout this is because it 's used later toactually make a few combinationpermutation calculations actually workok so just as long as you can sort ofkeep that as a side so I think to knownow I 'm just going to go through a fewdifferent types of factorial questionsokay so the couple to start off withlet 's start some easy ones what is 4factorial so this is 4 times 3 times 2times 1 and this is equal to 24 okay sowe 'll go a bit of a harder one there andwhat it wants to ask you what 5factorial divided by 3factorial is I 'm going to launchstraight into those because I think youcan get the idea of what each one ofthese is so how would you go aboutworking this out now and its most basicwhat we could do is we could just expandthese out we could say 5 times 4 times 3times 2 times 1 but I 'm going to showyou a few little tricks we 're doing acouple of shortcuts on this so the 3factorial could be 3 times 2 times 1 sowhat you 're going to notice here is thatthese guys here the 3 the to the 1 theycancel each other out because there'sone down there you see that so we justleft with 5 times 4 5 times 4 the answerequals 20 I 'm going to show you a littlesecret a little little shortcut for thiswhich is this so so think about my 5factorial I could think about this alsobeing like this I could think about itbeing 5 times 4 times 3 factorial is 3factorial is 3 times 2 times 1 but itsaves writing that out a 3 factorial is3 factorial so you can just straightawaycancel these ones out so you can alwaysjust ignore that and just go with thisfirst to any other 5 on the 4 so 5 times4 equals 20 what about a give one thatyou can trywhat about 70 factorial over 68factorial and you would want to put oneof these into calculator all the timebecause you 're going to be error messageso it 's really handy to use this littletrick rather than working at 70 times 69times 68 times 67 times and getting somehuge number we can use that littleshortcut and we can do this right we cango so we can be like 70 times 69 this isgoing to be and I 'm going to write thisin a different color because I wouldn'teven bother write this on occasionallythis is times 68factorial and this is going to be over60 eight factorial yeah but I could havenot even bothered put those togetherbecause then it 's going to cancel eachother out and then they 're going todisappear so we could just be left with70 times sixty-nine seventy times 69well the answer to that is going to be4,800 anddirty okay alright what about adifferent type of question with these onthat now go a bit of a different typeone that you might get what about we tryfive factorial over 3 factorial 2factorial okay so 2 3 factorial times 2factorial and what does that equalnow I 'm just going to launch straightinto how and work this out in a niceshorthand sort of way because 5factorial 3 factorial if I just what Idid before I 'm going to end up with 5times 4 alright because the rest of it'sgoing to be times 3 times 2 times 1 butthat 's going to be taken care of hereyeah so I 'm not going to either botherput that in and this part here is 2factorial n factorial is 2 times 1 soI 'm just going to put through therethat 's 2 times 1 is 2 so we end up with5 times 4 which is 20 and 2 is 2 20divided by 2 the answer is 10 what aboutwe try 12 factorial over 10 factorialtimes 2 factorial what about you givethis one a go and see here you go andhopefully what you 're going to do andsee if you can do this in a shortcutmethod hopefully you paused it now andthen in the India you 've tried it this12 factorial over 10 factorial is thiscan leave us with 12 times 11 becausethen the rest of its going to becanceled out correct yeah you 've gotthat ideas because that 's going to be 12times 11 times 10 past when we got ridof it and 2 factorial is just 2 so whatare we left with12 times 11 over 2 this is going to beequal to a 132 over 2 which is equal to66 all right now that is a star of ourfactorials we 're going to be using thesein later videos in combination andpermutation calculation so I thought weshould do a video and and have a look atthe video based on those first anyway Ihope you found that video useful see younext time bye test
