remember stop load free guide lesson lesson going focus parent function know function understand parent function better understand function transform start constant function f x equal k k real number case k equal equation equal horizontal line domain function gon na value negative infinity positive infinity range function going value k case next parent function linear function f x equal x diagonal line slope ay intercept see domain range linear function going value negative infinity positive infinity example shift linear function four new equation would equal x plus however domain range would still remain next parent function absolute value function f x equal absolute value x know absolute value always positive us understand parent function remains x axis domain negative infinity positive infinity range start sat move positive infinity never negative let see happen take function shift left see parent function move new location also see new equation reflect transformation particular shift see domain remain instead zero infinity negative four infinity next parent function quadratic function f x equal x squared parabola look familiar us compare absolute value function clearly see domain range domain negative infinity positive infinity range infinity let go ahead transform function shifting right new equation reflect transformation parent function x squared see domain would stay range would need infinity infinity next parent function square root function f x equal square root x function domain range zero positive infinity multiply parent function factor three would new graph represent times square root x still see domain range would remain last parent function strange inverse function f x equal x notice vertical asymptote domain function going real except x can not equal also horizontal asymptote equal zero range function real except equal zero know can not zero denominator x never equal zero transform parent function shifting axis new equation equal x plus location vertical asymptote x equal change domain change notice however horizontal asymptote exist sat equal two new domain real except two please follow us free daily math parent function graph transformation parent function graph transformation parent function graph transformation parent function graph transformation parent function graph transformation parent function graph transformation parent function graph transformation parent function graph transformation parent function graph transformation parent function graph transformation parent function graph transformation
