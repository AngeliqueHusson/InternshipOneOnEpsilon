okay now we 're going to draw someparallel lines and transversals and thenwe 're going to have a look at the anglesthat come with those okay so now we'relooking at now what happens when you gotthese you put these two together you gotthe parallel lines and then you kind ofcrossed it let 's draw one okay now let'sput some labels on this so we canactually start to talk about this thingI 'll call this one a B this one C D andthis one cute okay now what 's the normalway like you can see I 've tried to drawthese parallel but we usually label themin some way to indicate their power howdo we do that yeah do it so somewherealong there you put an arrow there andan arrow here okay and that tells usright these are never gon na be so here Ican say a B and C D are parallel linesor they 're just parallel okay but thattakes forever to write and you 're gonnabe saying these are parallel Lots soinstead we say this a B and then youliterally put two parallel lines rightyou say that so these two mean the samethinga B and C they 're parallel this is ournotation form a B and C D our pathso what 's P Q P Q is the transversalokay yes yeah yeah as in that is like ageez it is okay now what kinds of anglesare we got here and what patterns can wetake advantage of right well here 's oneor two suggest remember to look at theplanets before right and it 's like noone 's ever been to that planet how dothey know anything about what thatplanet is like well we can do a similarthing here suppose I should have broughtwith me okayI had a big giant protector I'veactually been yelling one of mysuffering and I measured this angle herenow just if you had to guess what doesit look like what 's a reasonable numberfor that in degrees it 's between oh bythe way we have language this what kindof angle is it in terms of size itsobtuse right so it 's between 90 and 180how about 120 I looks about rightdoes n't it I suppose I could dust itwith it if I measured out like a chapterright he 's the great D here I'vemeasured what angle but there are onetwo three four five six seven eightangles here and now I know the size ofall of them without measuring anymorehow do I do that how do I just measurewhat angle and then I can know the restsI think you tell me one other angleactually maybe I should put some morelabels on your call backs can you namean angle for me and tell me what itssize itcan anyone tell me for instancewhat 's P X P angle P X P what 's thatequal to it so it it goes along astraight line right Ami 's long straightlate angry long straight line they addup to think back think back they add uptoward a straight line you mean you meana X Y yeah okay so that 's 60 degreesthere could be opposite you do the samething here okay and I could keep going Ican go down to this one in a second okaybut how do we do itoh well because P choose a straight lineright an x and y on that straight lineangle be XY okay it 's not just equal toit is the same as what did you look atbeing X cubed they are actually the sameangle okay so the difference is one ofthe arms goes longer but it 's them it'san angle in there that matters okay nowin order to get from here like what didwe use to do thatwe knew angles on a straight line and weknew that vertically opposite there okaybut to get through all of these anglesthese fall down to these four we need afewer pieces and a few more shapes andpatterns on to recognize okay sounderneath where you draw this diagramwe 're going to draw three more okay andthey look like this he 's my first oneokay now when you got that it 's lookingshape okay and you looking at the twoangles that are nestled up in thecorners okaythese two angles they match togetherthey 're related to each other to pullaway they have a name starts to seizethey do n't know what they 're very closeit 's corresponding okay we 're going toget to code here in a second but theseare called corresponding okay now whenyou 've got corresponding angles betweenparallel lines what can we say aboutthem what can we say about them what dothey look like oh sure like I mean interms of the size of each angle how dothey look in comparison to each othersame as be executed how do they lookthey look the same do n't they they lookthe same and they uh okay correspondingangles on that 's an power though onesare equal okayso I can call this 80 degrees and if Iknow it 's 80 degrees I know the otherones a breeze as well okay now that wasthe F shape zhenia remember there areother shapes as well that help usrecognize patterns see and well it 's anincident let 's do thisactually I 'll do the same problem I'lldo the same cuz that 's not this okaythese two angles here if I 've gotparallel minds okay what do I call theseones starts with an A alternate anglesokay not to be confused with alternativeangles alternative is a musical stylealternate is about namesokay what 's the relationship again whatdoes it look like they how do theycompare to each other then it 's the samedo n't they okay alternate angles are uhsorry on parallel lines are also eatokay so I call those angles a let 's callthis B 3 okay so there 's your F which isyour corresponding anglesthere 's your Z which is your ten fingerswhat 's the last one it 's this it 's the Cis n't it nowbe careful I 'll really draw twodifferent seas okay and you 'll see whyit 's a good how do you make it you outall I see what you mean okay you can youcan draw that pose do this step you nowprobably most of you will draw your Clike that if you made it you it 'll beeven that way okay but next to this Iwant to draw another C looks a littlebit different okay I want to put boththem together and compare them right sohere 's the thing I want to draw thistime are you going to be careful how youdraw this one again okay now do youagree that basically they both the sameshape basically okay now which of theangles we 're interested in they 're theones in hereyeah and here okay where are they onthis second diagram ii see they 're inthe same spot ladies these corners nowlook at it carefully right correspondingangles equal alton angles also equal nowwhen you look at this one it 's temptingto think they look quite close to eachother but when you look at this otherone is kind of more obvious is n't itthese angles are not the same they'revery not the same this one 's blood whichis obtuse so it 's sharp which is acuteso how they related to each otherthat 's okay wait hold on they equal to180 they add up to what it is probablythe more specific which is n't what youwere saying I think it 's what you'rethinking but it 's a it 's a more specificway to say it okay now what do we callthese these are Co interior hey why arethey called comment to your young yeahand then back inside and both of theminside that 's what it came : Terryangles on parallel lines now we have aword to describe when things two thingsadd up to 180 degreeslong awkward word starts with an S weshould just put it sign at the door heyokay what are we sayingwhat was the word s supplementary okaywhich I think it 'd be nice if you put inbrackets after nice they add to 180degrees I can hold on a second we had aand a B & B what am I going to put inhere I ca n't say C and C because that'stheir equal right but they 're not equalso how do I say it if I caught forinstance if I call one see what was theother one B now I could call it I couldcall it D right but actually like C andD are related to each other an importantway namely this they add up to 180 so ifyou say C degrees plus some other thingsthe other angle trying to work out itsequal to 180that 's the supplementary does that makesense so if I want to know what thisthing is on its own how do I rearrangeit I 've got to subtract C from bothsides do n't I do you see what happenedsubtract C from both sides oh yeahwhatever that angle is right is equal to180 degrees minus C degreessee how I subtracted C from both sidesyeah so that 's what I 'm gon na call thisangle down here I 'm gon na call it 180minus C degrees okay C 180 minus that'swhat makes them supplementary okay nowthat we know that can we work out theseangles in here for instance what 's thisone equal to you could use you could useany of these you could say this it couldbe corresponding to something also tosomething or contribute or somethinglet 's say corresponding what 's an anglethat 's corresponding to this angle downherecan you name it what angle correspondsto P why D look at that look at thediagram and what shape you 're lookingfor can you name it can you name whichangle should say P why D it iscorresponding to can you name I thinkit 's P X B can you see itif I draw like this can you see this anF then you see that it 's just upsidedown the x1 okay yeah how are theyrelated these two angles they 're notcorrespond my dick on Syria so in thefirst place of cinema 's corresponding tothis thing up here which means it'sequal does this still make sense on acoin to your angle supplementary butthey are out there and you can keepgoingoh that 's 60 that 's 120 as well okay Review: Corresponding, Alternate & Co-Interior Angles Review: Corresponding, Alternate & Co-Interior Angles Review: Corresponding,
