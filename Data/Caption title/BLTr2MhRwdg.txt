Hello , everybody ! It 's snowing in the UK , so I thought I 'd take this opportunityto tell you a little bit about the maths of a snowflake.Now , I could have done this inside , in the warm , but I decided to do it outside in the snow , like some sort of fool.But no matter.Now , water molecules form something calleda 'hexagonal lattice . 'It looks -- it looks like this.Now water molecules , as you may know , is H2O -- that 's one oxygen atomand two hydrogen atoms.So the blue dots hereare the oxygen atoms.The black sticks are the hydrogen , so it makes something that looks like this -- like I said , this is called a hexagonal lattice.Now , as this grows , it grows into a hexagonal prism , which will have six-fold symmetry , which you can nearly see here.Now as this falls from the clouds , atmospheric conditions -- changes in temperature , things like that -- causes it to grow branchesat the six corners of the hexagonal prism.Now these branches are , in fact , grown independently , so they are not the same.So , in fact , snowflakesare not symmetrical.The vast majority of snowflakesare not symmetricalBut since the branches are grown under similar conditions , they are similar-looking branches , and so the snowflakesare nearly symmetrical.However , since no two paths are the same , each snowflakeis unique , and they do not look the same.So , as usual , if you have been , thanks for watching.I get to go inside now . test
