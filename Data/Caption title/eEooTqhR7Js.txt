let us analyze construction perpendicular bisector line segment fix length compass little half length kept point made arc b compass length keep compass point b make two intersect previous two call point b say line perpendicular bisector segment b let call c let join c b c ad two thing need prove first p equal b p second angle right angle able two thing say line c perpendicular bisector first thing know four length equal compass width unchanged look triangle c b triangle da b special two ways first isosceles mean pair triangle congruent second congruent condition side side side angle c b congruent angle da b corresponding angle congruent triangle angle c ba congruent angle ba corresponding angle mean four angle congruent look triangle c ad similar way isosceles congruent triple condition four angle congruent final step look four triangle ca p c b p p pall four triangle congruent si condition take instance consider two triangle two triangle congruent p equal b p corresponding four angle congruent four triangle congruent four together add degree one degree say line perpendicular bisector segment b logic behind construction perpendicular bisector line segment logic behind construction perpendicular bisector line segment logic behind construction perpendicular bisector line segment logic behind construction perpendicular bisector line segment logic behind construction perpendicular bisector line segment
