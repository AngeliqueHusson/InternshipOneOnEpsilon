Draw a circle and label the radius , diameter , center , and the circumference.Let me draw a circle.And it wo n't be that well drawn of a circle , but I think you get the idea.So that is my circle.I 'm going to label the center over here.I 'll do the center.I 'll call it c.So that is my center.And I 'll draw an arrow there.That is the center of the circle.And actually , the circle itself is the setof all points that are a fixed distance away from that center.And that fixed distance away that they'reall from that center , that is the radius.So let me draw the radius.So this distance right over here is the radius.That is the radius.And that 's going to be the same as this distance , whichis the same as that distance.I can draw multiple radii.All of these are radii , the distance between the centerand any point on the circle.Now , a diameter just goes straight across the circle , going through the center.From one side of the circle to the other side , I 'm going through the center.It 's essentially two radii put together.So for example , this would be a diameter.You have one radii , than another radii , all one line , going from one side of the circle to the other , going through the center.So that is a diameter.And I could have drawn it other ways.I could 've drawn it like this.That would be another diameter.But they 're going to have the exact same length.And finally , we have to think about the circumference.And the circumference is really just how faryou have to go to go around the circle.Or if you put a string on this circle , how long will that string have to be ? So what I 'm tracing out in blue right now , the length of what I 'm tracing out , is the circumference.So right over here , that is the circumference.And we 're done .
