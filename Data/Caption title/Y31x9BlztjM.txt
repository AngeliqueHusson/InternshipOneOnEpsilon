hi welcome to math antics in this videowe 're gon na learn something called primefactorization wow that sounds prettycomplicated does n't it but do n't worryit 's not that bad now from the nameprime factorization you can probablyguess that it involves factoring like welearned about in the last video but whatabout this word prime here what doesthat mean well to help you understandthat let 's use what we learned in thelast video to factor the number sevenlet 's see we could get seven by addingthree and four but factoring is notabout what you can add to get a numberit 's about what you can multiply wellsince I ca n't think of any numbers thatwould work let 's find factors by testingfor divisibility now I 'm gon na do thisreally fast using my calculator let'ssee okay here 's the numbers I got that'sinteresting the only two numbers thatdid n't leave remainders were one inseven and those are kind of obvious weknow that if you multiply any number byone you 'll just get that same number butwhy are n't there any other factors ofseven all right here 's why seven is aspecial kind of number called a primenumber now a prime number is just anumber that has exactly two factorsitself and one there 's a lot of primenumbers here 's the list of all the primenumbers that are less than twenty twothree five seven eleven thirteenseventeen and nineteen they 're the onesyou 'll use most often now some of youmight be wondering why one is n't on alist of prime numberswell one is a lot like a prime numberbut for some technical reasons it 's notconsidered prime okay so in a way primenumbers are just special numbers thatyou ca n't factor well unless you use theobvious factors of 1 and the numberitself but what 's so special about primenumbers anyway why do we need to knowabout themwell prime numbers are like the buildingblocks of the other whole numbers infact whole numbers that are not primeare called composite numbers becausethey 're composed of primes that meansthat you can getby multiplying prime numbers togetherhere 's a good way to see how that worksagain will list all the prime numbersthat are less than 20 and now let 's listall the composite numbers that are lessthan 20 over here the first compositenumber is 4 and you get 4 by multiplyingthe primes 2 times to the next compositenumber is 6 and you get it bymultiplying the primes 2 times 3 and thenext composite number is 8 which you getby multiplying the primes 2 times 2times 2 and the composite number 9 canbe made by multiplying the primes 3times 3 we could keep going like thisand you would see that all the compositenumbers are made by multiplyingdifferent combinations of prime numberstogether and each of these combinationsis called the prime factorization of itscomposite number ah so the primefactorization is a thing it 's the set ofprime numbers that you multiply togetherto get another number that 's true butyou can also use the term primefactorization as an action to describehow we find out what prime numbers acomposite number is made of and that'swhat we 're going to do next we 're goingto use prime factorization the action tofind the prime factorization the set ofprime factors for the number 12 and thatjust means that we 'll continue to factor12 until all the factors are primenumbers now to do this I 'm going to usesomething called a factor tree a factortree is just a diagram that helps youkeep track of multiple factoring stepswhen you factor a number you write thetwo factors below it with lines orbranches going to them and then if youfactor one of the factors you do thesame thing againyou 'll see how it works as we do thisexample so let 's get started 12 can befactored into 2 times 6 so we 're doneright well not yet because we 're doingprime factorization we need to keepgoing until all the factors are primenumbers so let 's see if they are well weknow that 2 is a prime number but is 6prime no it 's not because 6 can befactored into 2 times 3 and both 2 and 3are prime numbers so now we 're donefactoring and if we bring down that 2that we had from the first factoringstep we can see that the primefactorization of 12 thetwo times two times three now I knowwhat some of you are thinking I don'twant to factor 12 into 2 times 6I wanted to factor it into 4 times 3well ok then let 's try it that way thistime we 'll start by factoring 12 into 4times 3 but remember we need to keepfactoring until all of our factors areprime numbers so let 's see our 4 and 3prime numbers well 3 is prime before isnot 4 can be factored into the primes 2times 2 and again if we bring down that3 from the first step we see that wehave three prime factors 4 12 and thereare the exact same ones that we got thefirst time that means no matter whichway you start factoring as long as youfactor all the way down to prime numbersyou 'll always end up with the same groupof prime factors let 's try just one moreto make sure you 've got it let 's findthe prime factorization of 42 well forthe first step of our factoring I seethat 42 is an even number so that meansthat we can divide it by 2 to get ourfirst two factors so 42 divided by 2equals 21 so we can factor 42 into 2times 21 okay 2 is prime so we can'tfactor it any more but what about 21well if you 've memorized yourmultiplication table you might recognizethat 21 is one of the answers on it youcan get 21 by multiplying 3 times 7 sowe can factor 21 into 3 times 7 and ifyou did n't remember that you could havejust done some divisibility test and youwould have figured it out ok so whatabout the 3 and 7 well they 're bothprime so that means that we 're donefactoring we bring down the 2 from thefirst step and we can see that the primefactorization of 42 is 2 times 3 times 7all right now you know what primenumbers are and you know how to useprime factorization to find the set ofprime factors that a composite number ismade of and that set of numbers is alsocalled its prime factorization just toconfuse you as usual it 's important topractice what you 've learned in thisvideo so that you 'll get good at it andyou can practice by doing the exercisesfor this section good luck and thanksfor watching math
