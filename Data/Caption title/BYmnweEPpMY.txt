hello name maria math mammoth calm lesson study change convert fraction two basic method one sometimes use denominator method use division along division calculator let show first example first method sometimes works example write equivalent fraction denominator goes evenly times times course write decimal hundred another kind say wrote go evenly go evenly one thousand eight times equal go times course three thousandth write decimal fraction sare kind fraction need use method need divide even show two basic first case decimal end let say gon na write decimal going use long division notice gon na course go write decimal number put lots divide also wrote multiplication table side help goes times decimal point come right place look goes six times times need tobe careful lining minus drop many times go see times subtract drop many times go get subtract goes evenly get remainder division end right decimal end answer zero point going look case decimal actually end never seen kind time decimal get unending also going going repeat decimal divide notice goes inside corner eleven divisor put lots decimal start dividing goes seven zero times look seven goes times times drop zero goes times times subtract another zero thing like goes times get four drop zero goes times get subtract drop zero notice get know going go never gon na see remainder give remainder way write either way like herewith dot showing like draw bar let try divided notice smaller number goes goes times goes one time one time get five goes three times get forty five subtract five drop goes fifty three times see get anywhere gon na get five always three always get five remainder three keep notice digit one repeated write write way zero point one three write bar three one seen decimal unending sometimes need tell sometimes part maybe five six seven alone calculator may actually see repeat case may need round answer seen unending symbol repeat question arise would unending n repeat answer yes exist word rational rational number sare fraction new kind irrational one example number know number pi write pi unending never certain sequence kind fascinating topic lastly gon na look little fun pattern gon na write one xi decimal guess xi divide let goes times goes get one drop goes zero times drop another zero goes hundred nine times well see repeat put cost zero times tapen ade zero cost nine times zero point zero nine part zero nine guess one let see running space goes one time get eleven subtract times twenty one time eleven subtract eight zero point one eight one gon na leave check two guess part done convert fraction decimal beginner lesson convert fraction decimal beginner lesson convert fraction decimal beginner lesson convert fraction decimal beginner lesson convert fraction decimal beginner lesson convert fraction decimal beginner lesson convert fraction decimal beginner lesson convert fraction decimal beginner lesson convert fraction decimal beginner lesson convert fraction decimal beginner lesson convert fraction decimal beginner lesson convert fraction decimal beginner lesson
