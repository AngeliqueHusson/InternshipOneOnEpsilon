hey everybody welcome again to anotherone of my math videos in this video I'mgoing to teach you how to solve absolutevalue inequalities and there are twotypes of absolute value inequalities andthe first type is when the absolutevalue of something is less than a numberand I just used a to represent anynumber that 's when if the absolute valueis less than a number then your solutionis going to look like X is in betweenthe negative value of that number andthe positive value of that number andthe second type of absolute valueinequality is when the absolute value ofsomething is greater than a certainnumber and if the absolute value ofsomething is greater than a certainnumber then your solution is going tolook like X is less than the negativevalue of that number or X is greaterthan the positive value of that numberso let 's just get started with theseexamples right away so here we have theabsolute value of 2x minus 5 is lessthan or equal to positive 7 and eventhough there 's a equal sign underneaththe underneath the less than symbol thisstill qualifies as a absolute value lessthan example so if the absolute value ofsomething is less than a certain numberthen your answer is going to look like Xis going to be in between the negativevalue and the positive value of thatnumber so the inside of the absolutevalue of the 2x minus 5 is going to goin the middle and 2x minus 5 is going tobe greater than or equal to the negativevalue of our number which is 7 so thenegative value is negative 7 and it isgoing to be less than or equal topositive 7 now we need to solve ourcompound inequality and what we want todo is we want to get X by itself in themiddle so in order to get X by itselfI 'm going to get rid of this negative 5so I 'm going to add 5to all sides of this inequality on theleft-hand side we have negative 7 plus 5which is negative 2 our sign stays thesame which is less than or equal to inthe middle are negative 5 and positive 5cancelled out and the only thing we'releft with is a 2x and on the right handside our sign stays the same which isless than or equal to and a positive 7and a positive 5 gives us a positive 12once again we want to get X by itself sosince this 2 is being multiplied by theX to get rid of it I 'm going to divideby 2 and on the left hand side we havenegative 2 divided by 2 which isnegative 1we divided by a positive number wedivided by positive 2 so our signs staythe sameour sign stays less than or equal to inthe middle our twos cancel out and theonly thing we 're left with is our X onceagain our sign stays the same anotherless than or equal to and 12 over 2 is 6so now we have solved our absolute valueinequality X is greater than or equal tonegative 1 and less than or equal to 6so let 's just move on to our secondexample so here we have the absolutevalue of negative 3x plus 2 is greaterthan 7 and remember if the absolutevalue of something is greater than acertain number then your solution isgoing to look like X is less than thenegative value of that number or X isgreater than the positive value of thatnumber so since we have the absolutevalue of negative 3x plus 2 is greaterthan 7 then the inside of the absolutevalue which is negative 3x plus 2 isgoing to be less than the negative valueof that number and the negative value of7 is negative 7 or negative 3x plus 2 isgoing to be greater than the positivevalue of that number which is just 7 nowwe need to solve both these inequalitiesseparately so I 'll do the one on theleft first we have negative 3xtwo is less than negative seven we wantto get X by itself so I 'm going tosubtract two from both sides on the lefthand side the twos cancel out and theonly thing we 're left with is a negative3x our sign stays the same which is lessthan and negative seven and a negativetwo gives us a negative nine now I wantto get rid of this negative three andget X by itself so since the negative 3is being multiplied by the X I 'm goingto divide both sides by negative threeon the left hand side the negative 3 iscanceled out and the only thing we'releft with is X and since we divided by anegative number we divided by negative 3the sign flips and switch aside soinstead of a less then it becomes agreater than and negative 9 overnegative 3 is just positive 3 now I'mgoing to solve our any quality on theright we have negative 3x plus 2 isgreater than 7 once again we want to getX by itself so I 'm going to subtract 2from both sides on the left our twoscancel and the only thing we 're leftwith is a negative 3x our sign stays thesame which is greater than positive 7and negative 2 give us a positive 5 wewant to get X by itself X is beingmultiplied by the negative 3 to get ridof that negative 3 we 're going to divideboth sides by negative 3 on the lefthand side our negative 3s cancel out andthe only thing we 're left with is a Xsince we divided by a negative number wedivided by negative 3 our sign flips andswitches sides so instead of greaterthan it becomes less than and on theright hand side negative 5 over 3 cannotbe simplified so you just write itexactly the same so our answer is X isgreater than 3 or X is less thannegative 5 over 3 so I hope this videohelped you understand absolute valueinequalities just a little bit better ifyou need any extra help with livetutoring or homework solutions please goto my website at Mack
