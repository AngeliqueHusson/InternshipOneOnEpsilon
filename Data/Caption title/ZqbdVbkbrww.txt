okay here 's a little video that showshow we connect some of the things thatwe 're doing with this theme of Islam andmathematics with some of the things thatwe teach in elementary algebraintermediate algebra or maybe evenCollege Algebra so here 's how it lookswhen we do that okay so remember when wetalked about why do we call it algebraand we entered the question well it'sbecause of the first algebra bookwritten by Al charisma around the Year800 well look what I found here aproblem on completing the squareactually write out of Alcaraz B 's bookso al charisma says has this problem inthe book what is the square whichcombined with 10 of its roots will giveus some total of thirty-nine well whenAl charisma talks about the square inour notation would be x squared when hetalks about the root in our notation itwould be X so this same problem righthere or question in our notation lookslike this solve x squared plus 10x equal39 so what square when combined with 10of its roots gives us some total ofthirty-nine alright so here 's thesolution out of Al karisma 's book themanner of solving this type of equationis to take one half the roots justmentioned so that 's one half of 10 nowthe roots in this problem before isthere 10 therefore take 5 whichmultiplied by itself gives 25 ok so I'llcharisma takes half the coefficient ofthe linear term right here squares itand an amount which we add 239 giving usa sum total of sixty four having beentaken the square root of this which iseight subtract from that half the rootsfive leaving three the number threetherefore represents one of the roots ofthis square ok so that 's al charismasolution to this problem here is what itlooks like in our notation x squaredplus 10x equals 39 take half thecoefficient of 10 which is five squareit which is 25 add it to both sides thisbecomes the perfect square X plus 5squared the right side is 64 that meansthat X plus 5 squared equals 64 impliesthat X plus five is eight or X plus 5 isnegative 8 so we get 3 or negativeso al charisma is talking about thisroute right here three now what'sinteresting about this to me is that allof Al karisma 's book is written inparagraph form like this you have tounderstand that the equal sign isn'tinvented for hundreds of years hedoes n't have this notation to work withlike we do so it points out a couple ofthings one is the tremendous amount ofconcentration it must have taken to domathematics at the time I 'll cruise mewrote that book because everything is inparagraph form there is no symbols orequal signs of things like that to workwith the second thing is how nice ournotation is how compact and concise andall the information that 's contained init it actually makes it easier for us toreason our way through problems likethis so the other thing I think thatthis gives us is a connection with Alcharisma himself so here we are in analgebra class in the United Statestaking algebra learning how to solvequadratic equations by completing thesquare and we go back and solve aproblem written by Al charisma and wecan see in his own words here how thattranslates into what we do so it givesus kind of a bond with him that travelsthrough time we know exactly what he wasdoing in that book we 're solving thesame type of equation test
