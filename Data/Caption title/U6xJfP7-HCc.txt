JAMES GRIME : There are people out there who want to changethe way that you count.They want to change the world so that we stop counting using10 symbols and start counting using 12 symbols.I love them.I think these guys are great.Let 's talk about what we know so far.So , the way we count is the decimal system.It uses 10 symbols.So , let 's just write those out , first of all.0 , 1 , 2 , 8 , 9.Once we get to this point , we start to have to make ournumbers using combinations of the symbols we 've already got.12 , 13 , 14 , 22 , 23.Now , if we had been born with six fingers on each hand , thenwe would have 12 fingers , and maybe we would have startedusing something called the dozenal system where it'sbased on 12 symbols.And there are some people out there who think this is thesystem we should be using.They think we should have six fingers on each hand.They 're disappointed we don't have six fingers on each hand , because they think it 's a much easier way to count.So first of all , if we 're going to use 12 symbols , Ineed two extra.Let 's have a look at what they suggest.For 10 , we we 're going to have a symbol like this.That 's called dek.And for 11 , we 're going to have a symbol like this , whichis called el.So now it reads 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , dek , el.This would be 12.In fact , they say do.So this is do , do 1 , do 2 , do 3 , do 4 , do 5 , do 6 , do 7 , do8 , do 9 , do dek , and do el.So , do el would be 12 and 11 more.So that 's 23 , and then you keep counting.2 do is 24 , so 2 do.Two do 1 , 2 do 3 , 2 do 4 , and so on.Just like decimal system , really.It 's the exact same idea.There 's no difference between the dozenal system and thedecimal system.That would be 3 do , this would be 4 do.You keep going and you would get 9 do , then you would getdek do , el do , and then you 'd get do do.do do.12 12s.12 12s , that 's 144 , 12 12s , or gross.So if we write that out , 12 12s will be written like this.It 's 144 , or gross , or gro So that would be a gro.Something like this would be a mo.So if we take this year , it's 2012 , which is a good year topick , since we were talking about 12.So if we took the year 2012 , in the dozenal system , it'swritten like this.That is mo gro el 8.That 's the current year if you count in base 12.Now , there is a reason why these guys wantto count this way.Because they say it 's going to make arithmetic much easier.I want to make this clear.For serious maths , this system would not make any difference.But for day to day life , for your regular shopping , theseguys reckon that this 12 system would make life mucheasier because of the number of factors that 12 has.So 10 has -- let 's see.How many factors does it have ? It has 1.10 has 2 , 5 , and 10 itself.But 12 has much more factors.It has 1 , it has 2 , it has 3 , it has 4 , it has 6 , and it has 12 itself.The reason this is useful is it will make calculationsusing thirds and quarters much easierthan they are in decimal.Let 's do something like a 4 times table.If we did that in decimal , it would look like this.OK , it 's 4 , and then 2 times 4 is 8 , 3 times 4 is 12 , 4 times4 is 16 , 5 times 4 is 20.If we did it with the dozenal system , then it would have 4 , and we would have 8 , then we would have do , which is theirword for 12.Then we would have do 4 , do 8 , 2 do , 2 do 4 , 2 do 8,3 do , and so on.This pattern is a much easier pattern to teach children.4 , 8 , 0 , 4 , 8 , 0 , 4 , 8 , 0.The patterns are much easier to see.But the real strength of it is when you start dividing.If we wanted something like 1/3 , you know in decimal thatthis is 0.3333 , it goes on forever , which is fairly ugly.But in the dozenal system , it suddenly becomes really nice.If I want to write 1/3 , that 'd be 4 out of do.4/12 is 1/3.4 out of do , which is equal to 0.4.1/3 written in this system is 0.4.It 's not something that goes on forever.That 's the sort of thing that decimal does.It 's horrible.In dozenal , it does n't happen.Let 's do something else.Let 's do a quarter.A quarter of 12 , a quarter of do , is 3 out of do , whichwould be 0.3.1/2 would be 6 out of do , which is 0.6.If you want to do 1/6 , that would be 2 out ofdo , which is 0.2.Suddenly , all these become much simpler.You can see now why they like it.Suddenly , all those horrible things that happen in decimaldo n't happen in dozenal.If we had been born with six fingers on each hand and thisis the system we have learnt , and then I came to you andsaid , no , I 've got an idea , let 's not use base 12 , let'suse base 10 , you would laugh in my face.Why would you use base 10 ? It 's not as good.Now , naturally , we actually count in twelves , andhistorically , weights and measures were in twelves.So you would have feet and inches.12 inches to a foot.And currency was counted in twelves as well , because itwas naturally made dividing by half , dividing by thirds , anddividing by quarters and sixths.Much more easy and much more practical , and that 's thesystem we had.Then in the French Revolution , the French got obsessed withdecimalizing everything.They wanted to make weights and measures easier to use , sothey wanted to decimalize it , divide it into 100 because weuse the decimal system.Now , they had a choice.They could have decimalized everything , or they could havechanged the way we counted from 10 to 12.If they had done that , they could have kept all theweights and measures the same and all the calculations wouldhave been as easy to do in dozenal as theyare today in decimal.Now , they chose to make things metric and keep the system.Maybe they made the wrong choice.In fact , in the French Revolution , they went so madwith decimalization that they had a decimal week , they had adecimal calendar , and a decimal clock as well.They did that for a few years.Did n't take off.BRADY HARAN : What would pi be ? Would pi be the same ? JAMES GRIME : So , if we're talking about serious maths , something like pi , it would look a lot different , and itwould involve these dek symbols and el symbols.And if we look at it , it looks weird and unusual.But if you were born with this system , it would be fine.It would be normal.There 's no significant difference in the mathematics.The real difference this would make would be to just yourregular life.It might make arithmetic easier for children as well.BRADY HARAN : But the one thing , I guess , people aregoing to say is , when you're very small and learning aboutnumbers , your fingers and your hands are a really usefullearning aid.You 'd be taking that away from children right at the start.JAMES GRIME : Well , to answer that , there are some culturesthat still use base 12.And what they do is they count on thesegments of your fingers.1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , dek , el , do.Just as easy to use.MATT PARKER : How many hours do you want ? So the next one , let 's say we did 3 to the power of , to thepower of , arrow , arrow , arrow , or whatever you wantto call this , 3.That is equivalent to 3 to the double to the double to the 3 .
