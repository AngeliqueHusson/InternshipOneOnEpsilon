know angle measured two ways degree radian degree first angle simply union two ray let one ray two special kind used often one angle look like cal led aright angle measure ninety small circle number used denote degree confuse degree degree use measure temperature two different thing second special angle angle form straight line cal led straight angle measure angle degree arm rotate overlap initial arm scalled one full rotation plus degree bring question degree thousand degree one thousand convenient cant one full rotation one thousand degree well think probably making another video explain measure notebook use protractor like protractor degree see measure protractor let say want measure angle measure angle two thing need need keep arm angle zero angle position vertex angle center protractor normally take protractor angle video taking angle protractor like position measure angle arm like initial arm zero angle arm terminal arm tell us angle measure see degree somewhere close degree thats simple measure angle protractor wait look closely set angle marked inner semicircle goes way outer semicircle goes degree way time used inner circle measure angle think bit intuitive course angle degree angle acute hence chose inner semicircle got measure somewhere close need set angle let draw another angle like measure angle use procedure keep vertex angle center protractor arm zero angle place like look angle cute anywhere close degree time use outer semicircle zero get measure one set angle sit would difficult measure angle would tilt protractor bit yes given two set angle primarily convenience angle measured degree angle measured degree angle measured degree angle measured degree angle measured degree angle measured degree angle measured degree angle measured degree
