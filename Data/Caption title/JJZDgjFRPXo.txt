we know that angles can be measured intwo ways degrees and radians let'sunderstand degrees first angles aresimply a union of two rays let this beone ray there are two special kinds ofangles which are used very often oneangle looks like this and it 's called aright angle it measures ninety degreesthis small circle after the number isused to denote degrees and do notconfuse this degrees with the degrees weuse to measure temperature they are twodifferent things and the second specialangle is the angle which forms astraight line and is called a straightangle and the measure of this angle is180 degrees and when this arm willrotate and overlap the initial arm it iscalled one full rotation which equals180 plus 180 360 degrees this brings usto the question why 360 degrees why notone thousand degrees because onethousand sounds very convenient to mewhy ca n't one full rotation be onethousand degrees well think about it Iwill probably be making another video toexplain this how do we measure or drawangles in our notebook we use somethingcalled a protractor and it lookssomething like this the numbers you seeon the protractor are degrees firstlet 's see how we can measure anglesusing a protractor let 's say we want tomeasure this angle to measure an anglethere are only two things we need to dowe need to keep this arm of the angle atthe zero angle position and the vertexof the angle at the center of theprotractor normally we take theprotractor to the angle but in thisvideo I will be taking the angle to theprotractor like this now we are in aposition to measure the angle this armwill be like our initial arm which isthe zero angle and this arm will be theterminal arm which tells us the anglemeasure we can see that it measuresslightly more than 50 degrees somewhereclose to 53 degrees that 's how simple itis to measure an angle with a protractorbut wait look at it very closely it hastwo sets of angles marked the innersemicircle goes from 0 to 180 this wayand the outer semicircle goes from 0 to180 degrees this way but this time weused the inner circle to measure theangle Y think about it it 's a bitintuitive of course this angle is not130 degrees this angle is acute andhence we chose the inner semicircle andgot the measure somewhere close to 53degrees but then why do we need theother set of angles let 's draw anotherangle like this how do we measure thisangle we use the same procedure we keepthe vertex of the angle on the center ofthe protractor and this arm on the zeroangle so we place it like this look atthe angle it 's a cute it 's not anywhereclose to 130 degrees so this time we usethe outer semicircle the zero anglestarts here and we get the measure as 53degrees if we had just one set of anglesit would have been very difficult tomeasure this angle we would have had totilt the protractor a bit so yes we aregiven these two sets of angles primarilyfor convenience How are Angles Measured in Degrees?
