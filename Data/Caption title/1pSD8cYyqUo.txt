okay this video is gon na be about what'scalled the binomial theorem andtypically the binomial theorem is usedto expand expressions of the form a plusB raised to the n where R in values ofpositive integertypically I mean you could foil this outyou can multiply it out repeatedly ifyou had to the idea is by using thisformula is just going to be a much moreefficient way of doing that so a coupleof things remarks about the Formula onethe formula these coefficients you'regoing to use factorials again that'swhat the exclamation marks are calledalso to the the binomial coefficientsthe the numbers in front of thevariables we use what are calledcombinations okay so this is really acombination n choose R really you justneed to know the formula and be able towork with factorials there 's a couple ofdifferent ways to figure out thesecoefficients a calculator can do itobviously most calculators can do it notall of them have a key for combinationsand permutations but any graphing oneshould another way to find thesecoefficients is to use what 's calledPascal 's triangle and I 'm not gon na doit in this video but I am gon na talkabout Pascal 's triangle in another videoand show you how to come up with thesecoefficients but okay so it says back tothe formula eight plus me race to theend it 's gon na be into zero a to the Mand choose one a to the N minus one B tothe first we continue this process ofincreasing the number the R value by onenotice the exponent on the a it startsat in it 's gon na decrease by one theexponent on the B is gon na increase byone until the end you get to M so itsounds a little confusing but let 's uhlet 's go ahead and just write this outreal quick so I 'm gon na expand threethings here I 'm gon na expand a plus B tothe fifth and then I 'm just gon na simplyrelabeled that a little just to kind ofemphasize the formula I 'm gon na realable some things and hey turn that intoX plus 1 to the fifthand then I 'm gon na do one other one 3x -y to the third you may want to jot downthat formula or have it you know got abook with it but it says to expand aplus B raised to the fifth I 'm gonnaexpand it slightly different I 'm gonnathrow in one little extra thing but it'sit 's all gon na be equivalent okay so ourin value in this case is going to bejust the five so there 's our n value andit says when we expand the formula sowe 're gon na have a 5 choose 0 term itsays we take the first thing which is awe raise it to the fifth power we takethe second thing which is B and we raiseit to the zero power so you know up B tothe zero is simply gon na equal one sothat 's why we do n't write it but I'mgonna go ahead and stick it in therejust to uh just to emphasize it and thenI just notice the pattern so next it'llgo to five choose one so the number inthe bottom increases by one we 'll get ato the fourth so notice six exponentdecreases by one and then we 'll get B tothe first so it 's exponent increases byone and now we 're gon na keep thispattern up so this is gon na the numberin the bottom is gon na increase thenumber on the a is gon na decrease thenumber on the B is going to increaseokay so 5 choose 1 a to the fourth and Bto the first and now we 'll just continuethis 5 choose 2 we 'll have let 's see ato the third B squared we can squeeze itall in here probably not actually we'llhave 5 choose 3 again I 've got a I'mgonna decrease his exponent to 2 andincrease the exponent on the beat of 3okay so let me just drop down a wholeanother line here plus then we wouldhave five twosfor we would have a to the first B tothe fourth plus 5 choose 5 we would havea to the zero B to the fifth and now wehave expanded this out we still have tocalculate these binomial thesecoefficients 5 2 0 5 2 's 1 5 choose 2 52 3 etc but this is the idea I justagain I 'm trying to emphasize thepattern notice the exponent on the A'sdecrease the exponent on the beesincrease and notice at the same time ifyou add up the exponents 5 + 0 is 5 4 +1 is 5 3 + 2 is 5 if you add up theexponents you 're always going to get thein value so another little thing just tolook for let 's talk about evaluatingthese coefficients and briefly so maybeI 'll calculate a couple of them herepretty quickly so 5 choose 0 if we wereto calculate that that 's gon na be 5factorial using our formula over 5 - 0factorial times 0 factorial so again youmay want to see my video on combinationsevaluating combinations and factorialsso this is simply gon na reduce to 5factorial over 5 factorial well anythingdivided by itself is just 1 so reallythe coefficient 5 - 0 that 's gon na havevalue 1 okay so we could do 5 choose 1in the same way all I do is plug in a 1here I 'll plug in a 1 here I 'll plug ina 1 here this one will be a littledifferent when we simplify it so againI 'm gon na step through this part alittle faster we 'll have 5 factorialover 4 factorial divided by 1 factorial4 factorial if you expand out the 5factorial in the 4 factorial everythingis going to cancel5 times 4 times 3 times 2 times 1 forfactorials 4 times 3 times 2 times 11 factorial is just 1 so I could write x1 notice everything is going to cancelout except for the 5 so 5choose one is simply going to equal thenumber fivemaybe I 'll calculate one other one herelet 's do 5 choose 2 so 5 choose 2 thisis going to be 5 factorial over we takethe difference so that would be 3factorial and then 2 factorial so thiswill be 5 times 4 times 3 times 2 times1 that 's the numerator 3 factorial is 3times 2 times 1 2 factorial is 2 times 1so we could cancel out the 3 the 2 andthe 1 the 3 the 2 and the 1 we 're leftwith 5 times 4 which is 20 over 2 thatwill simply leave us with 10 ok so I'mgonna plug a 10 in there and you cancheck that 5 choose 3 is also going tobe equal to 10 you can check that 5choose 4 is also going to equal 5 and 5choose 5 is also going to equal 1 so nowwe 've pretty much got it everythingexpanded out I 'm gon na write it you knowa little nicer here so it says we wouldhave 1 a to the fifth and then B to the0 is just 1 plus 5 a to the fourth B tothe first plus 10 a cubed B squared plus10 a squared b cubed let 's tack on ourother 2 plus 5 a to the first B to thefourth plus a to the 0 which is 1 timesB to the fifth ok so it says a plus Braised to the 5th poweronce we expand it out evaluate thecoefficients plug it in it says hey thisis what we 're left with ok so again it'sslightly more efficient that certainlydoes n't mean that it 's easier that it'squick but again try you know trymultiplying out a plus B times a plus Btimes a plus B times a plus Botherwise this is what you 'd have to doyou 'd have to repeatedly multiply allthis stuff out collect your like termsput them back together and turn it backinto this stuff okay so well that meansthat if we want to simplify x plus 1 tothe fifthnotice that all we did was we replacedthe X with the value a and all we didwas replace our B value with the number1 so all we would have to do in ourformula is make the same the samechanges so a is gon na be the same thingas X so that I 'm gon na plug in an Xeverywhere I have an A everywhere I'vegot an X excuse me everywhere I 've gotan A I 'm gon na plug in X and then itsays B is gon na be equal to 1 solikewise we can plug that one in so 1 tothe first though is just 1 if we plug in1 squared again that 's just 1 so we canerase it likewise if we plug in 1 for Bcube we 'll get 1 cubed which is just 1if we plug in 1 for B to the fourthwe 'll get one if we plug 1 in for Bwe 'll get 1 to the fifth which is also 1so it says if you expand this X plus 1to the fifth we get everything that Ijust wrote here at the bottom it saysyou 'll get X to the fifth plus five X tothe fourth plus 10 X cubed plus 10 xsquared plus 5x plus 1 so again you knowI think this is much faster thanactually expanding it out and collectinglike terms especially imagine if thiswas a slightly larger number say 10 youknow it 's obviously gon na be pretty longbut much much much faster than expandingit out by multiplying everything let'sdo one slightly different actually Ithink what I 'm gon na do is I 'm gonnastop this one here because I thinkprobably a little long and if you needto you can relook at this one I 'm gonnado in another video I 'm gon na make thebinomial expansion for 3x minus y to thethird this one will be a little trickierthere 's a minus sign in there hey we'vegot some coefficients but that 's okay sofeel free to dig around and I will havethat one up as well The Binomial Theorem -
