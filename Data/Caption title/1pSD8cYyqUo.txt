video gon na scalled binomial theorem typically binomial theorem used expand expression form plus b raised n r value positive integer typically mean could foil multiply repeatedly idea formula going much efficient way couple thing remark formula one formula coefficient use factorial thats exclamation mark binomial front use really combination n choose r really need know formula able work factorial theres couple different ways figure calculator obviously calculator key combination sand permutation graph ing one another way find use whats triangle gon na doit video gon na talk triangle another video show come say back formula eight plus race end gon na zero mand choose one n minus one b first continue process increasing number r value one notice exponent start sat gon na decrease one exponent b gon na increase end get ounds little let go ahead write quick gon na expand gon na expand plus b fifth gon na little kind emphasize formula gon na real able thing hey turn plus fifth gon na one one third may want jot formula know got book say expand plus b raised fifth slightly different one little extra thing gon na equivalent value case going five theres n value say expand formula gon na choose term take first thing awe raise fifth power take second thing b raise zero power know b zero simply gon na equal one thats dont write go ahead stick u h emphasize notice pattern next five choose one number bottom increase one well get fourth notice six one well get b first exponent increase gon na keep pattern gon na number bottom gon na increase gon na decrease b going choose fourth b first well continue choose well let see third b squared squeeze probably actually well choose got decrease exponent increase exponent beat let drop whole another line plus would five would first b fourth plus choose would zero b fifth expanded still calculate binomial choose idea trying emphasize pattern notice exponent decrease exponent bees increase notice time add exponent add always going get value another little thing look let talk coefficient briefly maybe ill calculate couple pretty quickly choose calculate thats gon na formula times factorial may want see video combination simply gon na reduce factorial well anything divided really coefficient thats gon na value could choose way plug ill plug ill plug one little different simplify gon na step part little faster well factorial factorial divided factorial expand factorial everything going times times times times times times times factorial could write notice everything going cancel except one simply going equal five maybe ill calculate one one choose choose going factorial take difference would factorial times times times thats numerator factorial times factorial times could cancel left times simply leave us k plug check choose also going tobe equal check also going equal also going equal weve pretty much got everything expanded gon na write know little nice r say would fifth b plus fourth b first plus cube b squared squared b cube let tack plus first b fourth plus times b fifth k say plus power expand evaluate plug say hey left k slightly efficient certainly doesnt mean easier quick try know try multiplying plus b times plus b times plus b times plus youd youd repeatedly multiply stuff collect like term sput back together turn back stuff well want simplify x plus fifth notice x value replace b value would formula make gon na x gon na plug x everywhere everywhere x excuse everywhere gon na plug x b gon na equal likewise plug one first though plug squared thats likewise plug b cube well get cube plug b fourth well get one plug b well get fifth also say expand x plus fifth get everything wrote bottom get x fifth plus five x fourth plus x cube plus x squared plus plus know think much faster actually expanding term especially imagine slightly number say know obviously gon na pretty long much much much faster expanding multiplying everything one slightly different actually think gon na one think probably little long need relook one another video gon na make binomial expansion minus third one little minus sign hey weve got coefficient thats feel free dig around
