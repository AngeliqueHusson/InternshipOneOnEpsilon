all right in this video we 're going todo an example of induction and in thiscase we 're going to prove part a herewe 're going to try to justify that 4plus 9 plus 14 plus 19 plus dot dot plus5 and minus 1 is equal to n over 2 timesthe quantity 3 plus 5 n so the firstthing I 'm going to do is the basis stepI 'm going to show that this is valid inthis case for N equals 1 ok so let 's seewell if we use N equals 1 on the Leftwe 'll just be left with 4 on the rightside if we plug it in I put a littlequestion mark because I 'm trying toverify in fact these are equal so I kindof asked myself this for equal what I'mabout to get well if we plug in 1 we'llget 1/2 and then we 'll have 3 plus 5well on the right side we 'll get 8 times1/2 which is 4 so definitely this istrue ok so so this is valid and now whatwe 're going to do is we 're going to dothe induction stepso what we 're going to do is we 're goingto assume the statement is true we'regoing to assume the statement is truefor the value N equals K and we 're goingto show it 's true for the value N equalsK plus 1 okay so let 's see what a littleformula go okay so we 're going to assumehere that if we take 4 plus 9 plus 14plus 19 plus dot dot 5 K minus 1 we'regoing to assume that that is in factequal to K over 2 times 3 plus 5 K andnow we have to show that if we take 4plus 9 plus 14 plus 19 plus dot dot 5 Kminus 1 and then one additional term 5times the quantity K plus 1 minus 1 doesthat equal K plus 1 over 2 times 3 plus5 times K plus 1 on the right ok so thisis what we have to justify it if we canjustify this last line well then we willhave proven our statement okay so we'regoing to use our induction step here byassumption this first bit of stuff 4plus 9 plus 14 plus 19 plus dot dot 5 Kminus 1 that 's going to give us K over 2times 3 plus 5 Kbut then we still have this additionalterm of five times k plus one minus onewe 're asking ourselves again does thisequal k plus one over two times threeplus five times k plus one and typicallywhat I do here is I kind of just cleanup both sides collect like terms and tryto see if in fact you know these thingsare in fact equal so I 'm going to do alittle simplification here as we go Kover 2 I 'll leave that alone for themoment inside the parenthesis we wouldhave five K if we distribute we wouldhave a positive five minus one whichwould be positive four on the right sidewe have K plus 1 over 2 it looks like wewould have 3 plus 5 K plus 5 so againI 'm still asking myself are these equalwell on the right side if we distributewe would have three K over 2 plus 5 Ksquared over 2plus five k plus four okay on the rightside if we distribute well let 's let'sclean up inside the parentheses firstand then we 'll distribute three plusfive would be eight and then we stillhave our five K left over so again I'masking myself are these equal on theleft side we can get common denominatorsif we wanted to we do n't really have tobut we could multiply our 5k top andbottom by two that would give us 10 Kover 2 plus 3 K over 2 that would giveus 13 K over 2 plus 5 K squared over 2plus 4 on the right if we distributethis is one big term so we would have 8times k plus 1 over 2 plus 5 K times kplus 1 over 2 I 'm not going to do muchon the left side now for the moment soagain are these equal I 'm going to keepputting my question marks in therelet 's see if we distribute on the rightwill get 8k well let 's even justsimplify first we can make 8 over 2 into4 so really when we distribute we wouldget 4 k plus 4 and then it looks like wewould have 5 k squared over 2 plus 5 Kover 2 when we multiply that out alittle bit well let 's see I think we'regetting pretty close at this point soagain I 'm still wondering are theseequalwell let 's see we can take our 4 K over1 multiply top and bottom by 2 thatwould give us 8 K over 2 plus 5 K over 2that would be 13 K over 2 we 've got our5 K squared over 2 term in there we'vegot our plus 4 in there so to me yes infact these two sides are equal so nowwe 've proved our induction step and thattogether with our base our basis stepdoes in fact show that this originalstatement is in fact true Proof by Induction - Example 1 Proof by Induction - Example 1 Proof by Induction - Example 1
