hello welcome section calculus extra practice integration section want learn calculate area right lot far learning calculate integral teaching integral really area curve way occasionally given two curve want find area two curve going learn today easiest way handle talk draw quick picture let draw quick little set know x axes let draw couple thing axis first draw curve could shape call f x let draw dashed b find area curve f x b would well pretty easy done lot would integrate f x function b limit integration going yield area curve way curve way tal ked point gave another curve said x g x look different put x said find area g x curve x axis b would say well easy integrate g x b integration going give surface area way graph way x axis know find told find surface area f graph geo graph word would actually find surface area surface area way x axis find right label let say find well think integral curve way integral curve way able find area integral basically subtract entire area take entire area subtract area whatever difference going exactly really nothing else concept area case region equal integral f x minus g x x integrate b go along boundary really really theres nothing nothing else take two function subtract integrate know couple ways could could integrate b f x get answer could integrate g x band get answer could take two separate answer subtract going get exactly thing get function integrate added subtract edit like first one second one case subtract ing typically written calculus book really taking area minus area second one getting area two curve calculus area two curve calculus area two curve calculus area two curve calculus area two curve calculus area two curve calculus area two curve calculus area two curve calculus area two curve calculus area two curve calculus
