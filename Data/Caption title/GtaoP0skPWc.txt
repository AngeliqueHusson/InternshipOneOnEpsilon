Well now you 've learned what I think is quite possibly one ofthe most useful concepts in life , and you might already befamiliar with it , but if you're not this will hopefully keepyou from one day filing for bankruptcy.So anyway , I will talk about interest , and then simpleversus compound interest.So what 's interest ? We all have heard of it.Interest rates , or interest on your mortgage , or howmuch interest do I owe on my credit card.So interest -- I do n't know what the actual formal definition , maybe I should look it up on Wikipedia -- but it'sessentially rent on money.So it 's money that you pay in order to keep moneyfor some period of time.That 's probably not the most obvious definition , butlet me put it this way.Let 's say that I want to borrow $ 100 from you.So this is now.And let 's say that this is one year from now.One year.And this is you , and this is me.So now you give me $ 100.And then I have the $ 100 and a year goes by , and I have $ 100 here.And if I were to just give you that $ 100 back , you wouldhave collected no rent.You would have just got your money back.You would have collected no interest.But if you said , Sal I'm willing to give you $ 100 now ifyou give me $ 110 a year later.So in this situation , how much did I pay you to keepthat $ 100 for a year ? Well I 'm paying you $ 10 more , right ? I 'm returning the $ 100 , and I 'm returning another $ 10.And so this extra $ 10 that I'm returning to you is essentiallythe fee that I paid to be able to keep that money and dowhatever I wanted with that money , and maybe saveit , maybe invest it , do whatever for a year.And that $ 10 is essentially the interest.And a way that it 's often calculated is a percentageof the original amount that I borrowed.And the original amount that I borrowed in fancy banker orfinance terminology is just called principal.So in this case the rent on the money or the interest was $ 10.And if I wanted to do it as a percentage , I would say 10 overthe principal -- over 100 -- which is equal to 10 % .So you might have said , hey Sal I 'm willing to lend you $ 100 ifyou pay me 10 % interest on it.So 10 % of $ 100 was $ 10 , so after a year I pay you $ 100 , plus the 10 % .And likewise.So for any amount of money , say you 're willing to lend me anyamount of money for a 10 % interest.Well then if you were to lend me $ 1,000 , then the interestwould be 10 % of that , which would be $ 100.So then after a year I would owe you $ 1,000 plus 10 % times $ 1,000 , and that's equal to $ 1,100.All right , I just added a zero to everything.In this case $ 100 would be the interest , butit would still be 10 % .So let me now make a distinction between simpleinterest and compound interest.So we just did a fairly simple example where you lent moneyfor me for a year at 10 % percent , right ? So let 's say that someone were to say that my interest ratethat they charge -- or the interest rate they charge toother people -- is -- well 10 % is a good number -- 10 % per year.And let 's say the principal that I 'm going to borrowfrom this person is $ 100.So my question to you -- and maybe you want to pause itafter I pose it -- is how much do I owe in 10 years ? How much do I owe in 10 years ? So there 's really two ways of thinking about it.You could say , OK in years at times zero -- like if I justborrowed the money , I just paid it back immediately , it 'd be $ 100 , right ? I 'm not going to do that , I 'm going to keep itfor at least a year.So after a year , just based on the example that we just did , Icould add 10 % of that amount to the $ 100 , and I wouldthen owe $ 110.And then after two years , I could add another 10 % of theoriginal principal , right ? So every year I'm just adding $ 10.So in this case it would be $ 120 , and in year three , I would owe $ 130.Essentially my rent per year to borrow this $ 100 is $ 10 , right ? Because I 'm always taking 10 % of the original amount.And after 10 years -- because each year I would have had topay an extra $ 10 in interest -- after 10 years Iwould owe $ 200.Right ? And that $ 200 is equal to $ 100 of principal , plus $ 100 ofinterest , because I paid $ 10 a year of interest.And this notion which I just did here , this is actuallycalled simple interest.Which is essentially you take the original amount youborrowed , the interest rate , the amount , the fee that youpay every year is the interest rate times that originalamount , and you just incrementally paythat every year.But if you think about it , you 're actually paying asmaller and smaller percentage of what you owe goinginto that year.And maybe when I show you compound interestthat will make sense.So this is one way to interpret 10 % interest a year.Another way to interpret it is , OK , so in year zero it 's $ 100that you 're borrowing , or if they handed the money , you sayoh no , no , I do n't want it and you just paid it back , you 'd owe $ 100.After a year , you would essentially pay the $ 100 plus 10 % of $ 100 , right , which is $ 110.So that 's $ 100 , plus 10 % of $ 100.Let me switch colors , because it 's monotonous.Right , but I think this make sense to you.And this is where simple and compound intereststarts to diverge.In the last situation we just kept adding 10 % of the original $ 100.In compound interest now , we do n't take 10 % ofthe original amount.We now take 10 % of this amount.So now we 're going to take $ 110.You can almost view it as our new principal.This is how much we offer a year , and then wewould reborrow it.So now we 're going to owe $ 110 plus 10 % times 110.You could actually undistribute the 110 out , and that'sequal to 110 times 110.Actually 110 times 1.1.And actually I could rewrite it this way too.I could rewrite it as 100 times 1.1 squared , and that equals $ 121.And then in year two , this is my new principal -- this is $ 121 -- this is my new principal.And now I have to in year three -- so this is year two.I 'm taking more space , so this is year two.And now in year three , I'm going to have to pay the $ 121that I owed at the end of year two , plus 10 % times the amountof money I owed going into the year , $ 121.And so that 's the same thing -- we could put parentheses aroundhere -- so that 's the same thing as 1 times 121 plus 0.1 times121 , so that 's the same thing as 1.1 times 121.Or another way of viewing it , that 's equal to our originalprincipal times 1.1 to the third power.And if you keep doing this -- and I encourage you do it , because it 'll really give you a hands-on sense -- at the end of10 years , we will owe -- or you , I forgot who 's borrowing fromwhom -- $ 100 times 1.1 to the 10th power.And what does that equal ? Let me get my spreadsheet out.Let me just pick a random cell.So plus 100 times 1.1 to the 10th power.So $ 259 and some change.So it might seem like a very subtle distinction , but it endsup being a very big difference.When I compounded it 10 % for 10 years using compoundinterest , I owe $ 259.When I did it using simple interest , I only owe $ 200.So that $ 59 was kind of the increment of how much morecompound interest cost me.I 'm about to run out of time , so I 'll do a couple moreexamples in the next video , just you really get a deepunderstanding of how to do compound interest , how theexponents work , and what really is the difference.I 'll see you in the next video . test
