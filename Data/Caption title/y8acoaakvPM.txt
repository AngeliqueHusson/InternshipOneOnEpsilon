SIMON PAMPENA : So , 2 〜 2 〜 2 〜 2 〜 2 ... OK , two multiplied by itself five times is 32.So the opposite of that , is a question : What number multiplied by itself five times gives you 32 ? And the way you express that , is that you go , is 32 to the fifth.That 's the fifth root.And that happens to be 2.So , because in mathematics , there 's some beautiful patterns , there 's actually a waythat you can work out the fifth root of very large numbers in your head very quickly.And you do n't have to use a lot of computing power , brain power.So , Brady , if you take any double digit number you like , and multiply by itself5 timesand you tell me that number , in English , from left to right , and I write it down , I will be able to tell you what your original number was.OK.OK , you got a number ? BRADY HARAN : Yeah . SIMON PAMPENA : Is it big ? BRADY HARAN : Yeah , it 's big . You ready ? It 's 79 million ！ PAMPENA : Wait a minute . ！PAMPENA : 79 million . ！ HARAN : 235 thousand.PAMPENA : 235 thousand.HARAN : 168.PAMPENA : 168 . ( the number was 79,235,168 ) So your number is 38 ? HARAN : Well yes it is.PAMPENA : It is ? ！ HARAN : It is.PAMPENA : OK. HARAN : Very good . [ chuckles ] PAMPENA : How did I do it so quickly ? I 'm genius . [ chuckles ] HARAN : We 're gon na ... [ Both laugh . ] PAMPENA : Well , obviously not . I did it because there 's a pattern in the numbers.OK ? So ... it 's actually to do with a wonderful mathematician , Euler . This is Euler 's Theorem.And I 'm actually not going to write down what Euler 's theorem is.I 'm actually going to show you a result from Euler 's Theorem.For any number , a.a^5 , is equal to 10m+a for some m.So you can get that from Euler 's Theorem.Now that 's not the theorem itself , but I just want to cut to the chase here.So , what is , let 's actually do an example . So let 's do 47^5.Okay , so 47^5 ！ actually , we can write it as 22,934,496times 10 , + 47.So , if we expand this out , a number *10 , you put a 0 on the end , right ? So it goes 229,344,960+ , and if we do what we do in primary school , +47 , look what you 've got at the end.0+7=7 . So what that means is , any number multiples by itself 5 times , the last digitdoes n't change.So for me to know what the last digit of your number was , I just have to wait to hear you say it.And then I write it down.OK ? The first digit ? That 's a bit harder.The first digit , you 've got to memorize all the powers of the 10s , ^5.So , that 's 100,000.20^5 ... is 3 million.30^5 . There 's that.40^5 is that.50^5 is that.60^5 . That.80^5 is , uhh ... And 90^5.Now the interesting point here , is that these numbers , you can notice ... 10-1 , 20-2 , 30-3 , 40-4 . See that ? These numbers are all the same.Those ！ 5 , 6 ！ They 're the same as that number there.And the reason why is because of that if you can think about it.So when you said the number , Brady ！ So you said 79 million ！ automatically I thought 79 millionSo I know that 's between 30^5 , and 40^5 . OK ? ！And then you went on and did 235 thousand ！I had kind of tuned out at that stage . I was n't really paying attention . Do n't take it personally.I was just waiting for you to hist the jackpot at the end.So if you have someone who reads out the number , who 's an accountant or something , or an engineer ！there 's an engineer ！who just kinds of gives you a rough estimate , you 're stuffed.HARAN : That 's still a big ask to memorize all that.PAMPENA : Is it ? It did n't take me that long.You just have a feel for the numbers.It does n't have to be that precise . ！ HARAN : You just need to memorize the ！ PAMPENA : You just need toknow that it 's anything between 3,000,000 and 24,000,000 . You know , you do n't have to be that precise.Anything that 's greater than 100,000,000 and ！ You know , when I go to schools , if I do this for school kids , theyalways pick something in the 90s . But the 90s is so easy , because it 's anything greater than 6,000,000,000.So if they go , `` 8,000,000 ! ! `` , you just go , `` 9 . `` And you just wait until they say the thing at the end.The hardest ones are actually down here.Down here.And it 's actually hard in the transition.I had trouble quite a bit . Believe it or not , a lot kids love to do 69^5 . And that one was hard , because it crossed over from 777 million up to 1.7 billion.That was a bit hard.But I got used to it .
