So let 's think a little bit about powers of 0.So what do you think 0 to the first power is going to be ? And I encourage you to pause this video.Well , let 's just think about it.One definition of exponentiation is that you start with a 1 , and then , you multiply this number times a 1 one time.So this is literally going to be 1 times -- let me do it in the right color -- it 's 1 times 0.You 're multiplying the 1 by 0 one time.1 times 0 , well , that's just going to be equal to 0.Now , what do you think 0 squared or 0 to the second poweris going to be equal to ? Well , once again , one way of thinking about thisis that you start with a 1 , and we'regoing to multiply it by 0 two times.So times 0 times 0.Well , what 's that going to be ? Well , you multiply anything times 0 , once again , you are going to get 0.And I think you see a pattern here.If I take 0 to any non-zero number -- so to the power of any non-zero , so thisis some non-zero number , then this is going to be equal to 0.Now , this raises a very interesting question.What happens at 0 to the 0-th power ? So here , 0 to the millionth power is going to be 0.0 to the trillionth power is going to be 0.Even negative or fractional exponents , which we haven't talked about yet , as long as they're non-zero , this is justgoing to be equal to 0 , kind of makes sense.But now , let 's think about what 0 to the 0-th poweris , because this is actually a fairly deep question.And I 'll give you a hint.Well , actually , why do n't you pause the videoand think a little bit about what 0 to the 0-th powershould be.Well , there 's two trains of thought here.You could say , look , 0 to some non-zero number is 0.So why do n't we just extend this to all numbersand say 0 to any number should be 0.And so maybe you should say that 0 to the 0-th power is 0.But then , there was another train of logicthat we 've already learned , that any non-zero number , if you take any non-zero number , and you raise itto the 0-th power.We 've already established that you start with a 1 , and you multiply it times that non-zero number 0 times.So this is always going to be equal to 1for non-zero numbers.So maybe say , hey , maybe we should extend thisto all numbers , including 0.So maybe 0 to the 0-th power should be 1.So we could make the argument that 0 to the 0-th powershould be equal to 1.So you see a conundrum here , and there 's actuallyreally good cases , and you can get actually fairlysophisticated with your mathematics.And there 's really good cases for both of these , for 0 to 0-th being 0 , and 0 to the 0-th power being 1.And so when mathematicians get into this situation , wherethey say , well , there's good cases for either.There 's not a completely natural one.Either of these definitions wouldlead to difficulties in mathematics.And so what mathematicians have decided to do is , for the most part -- and you'll find people who will disputethis ; people will say , no , I like one more than the other -- but for the most part , this is left undefined.0 to the 0-th is not defined by at least just kindof more conventional mathematics.In some use cases , it might be definedto be one of these two things.So 0 to any non-zero number , you 're going to get 0.Any non-zero number to the 0-th power , you 're going to get 1.But 0 to the 0 , that 's a little bit of a question mark . test
