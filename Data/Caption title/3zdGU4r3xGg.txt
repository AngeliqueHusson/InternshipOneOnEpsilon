possible system solution example two equation equal x plus equal x minus tell looking slope see graph first one equal x plus ha sa intercept slope draw graph k second one equal x minus intercept negative aslope see key point right parallel remember study slope parallel see solution every point equation none point line time none point satisfy equation dont intersect theres point time say solution system equation writing answer thats would write would simply write solution maybe add little explanation solution parallel see graph see looking value slope algebra system solution algebra system solution
