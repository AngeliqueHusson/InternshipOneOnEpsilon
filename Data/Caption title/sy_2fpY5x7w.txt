hey everyone and welcome to mash up mapthank you so much for checking out thislesson our animated math lessons are alittle bit different than anything youmay have seen before before we getstarted just a few pointers we recommendhaving a pen and paper at your sidewhile you work through the lesson weencourage that you work along with usand write down any questions that maycome up and do n't be afraid to presspause stop and go back when you need toyou can head over to mash up math commto download the PDF notebook file thataccompanies this lesson so let 's getstartedlet 's start this lesson off with a scenefrom a skate park it was pretty cool butwhat 's also pretty cool is this lessonon multiplying binomials let 's start outby asking what is a binomial well justlike a bicycle has two wheelsa binomial is a polynomial with twoterms in this example x + 1 the firstterm is X and the second term is thepositive 1 note that a binomial is notan equation unless it equals somethingfor this lesson we 're going to exploredifferent methods for multiplying twobinomials together students often referto this scenario as double bubblebecause of the two sets of parentheseswhich are being multiplied togetherin this lesson we are going to explorethree methods the distributive methodthe box method and the foil method solet 's go ahead and get started with ourfirst method the distributive method nowfor this we 're going to look at anexample we 're multiplying the binomialit 's 2x plus 3 and X plus 7for this method we take the first termof the first binomial multiplied by thesecond binomial then the second term ofthe first binomial multiplied by thesecond binomial so we can colorcoordinate this to actually see what'sgoing on here now to simplify further wehave to distribute both sides now forthe first set 2x times X is 2x squared2x times positive 7 is positive 14x 3times X is just 3x and 3 times 7 is 21notice that the middle terms are liketerms 14 X and 3x whose sum is 17 Xnow that we can not simplify anymore ouranswer is a product and expanded formour second approach here the Box methodis a pretty cool way to multiplybinomials and we 'll take a look at adifferent example now for this methodyou have to construct your own grid a2x2 grid that we 're going to use this isthe box in the box method well startwith the first binomial X minus 5 andwe 're gon na rewrite it over the top rowof our grid then we take the secondbinomial 6x plus 12 and we 'll rewrite italong the left column of the grid 6xplus 12 now you want to go ahead andfill in each box which is the product ofthe corresponding terms so the first boxsix x times X is six x squared the topright box is the product of six andnegative 5 which is negative 30x thebottom left box is the product of 12 andX which is 12 X and the final box thebottom right is the product of 12 andnegative 5 which is negative 60 sincewe 're looking to express this now inexpanded form you want to go ahead andadd these terms together now the firstterm 6x squared is on its own but weshould notice that the negative 30x andthe positive 12x are like terms and canbe simplified their sum is negative 18xand finally that negative 60 term getstagged on to the end and we have ourexpanded solution 6x squared minus 18xminus 60and our final method is the infamousfoil methodnow for this example we 're looking atthe binomial 8 minus 5 X raised to thesecond powerso we 're taking a binomial and we'resquaring it now I know that this onelooks different than the last two but weshould know that when we squaresomething it 's the same thing asmultiplying it by itself so now we seeit looks more familiar now foil is anacronym the F in foil stands for firstwhich is the product of the first termin each binomial in this case 8 times 8which equals 64 the O and foil standsfor outer the product of the outsideterms so it 's 8 times negative 5x whichequals negative 40 X the I in foilstands for inner or inside the productof the inner terms negative 5x timespositive 8 again is negative 40 X andthe Ln foil stands for last the productof the last term 's negative 5x timesnegative 5x is positive 25 x squared wecan simplify these terms now again wenotice that the middle terms negative 40X and negative 40 X are like terms whosesum is equal to negative 80 X noticehere that this is not in that ax squaredplus bx plus c form that we had in thelast two examples so we 're going to goahead and switch the x squared term andthe constant term the 25 x squared andthe 64 and now we have our solution inexpanded formlet 's take a quick look at a visual aidfor remembering the foil method againremember that the F in foil stands forfirst the product of the first terms ofthe two binomials the O stands for outerthe product of the outer or outsideterms the I in foil stands for inner orinside the product of the inside termsand finally the Ln foil stands for lasttwo product of the last term 's haha coolso some quick final words here on thislesson on multiplying binomials there'sdifferent methods for finding theproduct of two binomials in this lessonwe covered the distributive method thebox method and the foil method each ofthese three methods will allow you tocorrectly express the product of twobinomials in expanded form the onlyquestion is which method are you gonnause seriously which method are you gonnause thanks a lot
