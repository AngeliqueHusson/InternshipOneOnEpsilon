g day welcome tech math channel gon na look video working area circle amount space guess circle way follow ill drop circle think first ill go afield term well looking area circle going looking thing cal led radius radius distance middle edge matter cal led radius radius way might measure circle term entire distance across cal led diameter diameter probably see twice radius way work area circle follow area circle equal pi squared pi special constant thats used working circle generally equal easiest way accurate way use actually get calculator multiplying thereby radius squared radius times whatever times two times pi put calculator computer actually got output standard mode scientific mode got pie lot calculator written like particular one thats written actually end big long b la b la b la b la b la b la big rational string going use actually workout area circle thats pretty easy stuff type get get work era circle leave particular formula gon na say circle work radius want look area radius know rid radius centimeter area want know area obviously space within mean lurk centimeter squared guy radius centimeter arrogance going come centimeter squared first sub formula pi times radius square times centimeter gon na hit calculator first let go pi times times get answer seventy eight point five four rounded seventy eight point five four centimeter squared thats easy work area circle really really critical remember particular formula go another one give go working say ill give one diameter time remember diameter twice radius twice size radius ill draw circle one want work diameter across gon na gon na look area area equal pi r squared equal pi know certainly pause ill come back answer pause anyway answer ing table radius radius half diamond times times answer gon na squared even fix upright times area equal follow calculator clear pi times times equal two hundred fifty four point four seven hope double shake point tokay thats squared easy work area circle type thing might get ked course might get ked actually segment circle say given circle right far half circle thats expect ing say actually within area quarter circle knew one thing distance six centimeter another area part quarter circle might good pitcher one put quarter circle area equal pi squared quarter circle draw would look like theres circle thats quarter gon na actually divide answer let equal pi times radius six minute squared divided gon na go order rent let geta calculator gon na go pi times six times six times clear start pi times times divided twenty eight point two seven equal twenty eight point two seven centimeter squared want put calculator something really really quickly decide going use pi instead around instead type forgiver ill show difference get use pi actually use particular number wont seem like much three people instead power times six times six equal divided four equal twenty eight point two six yeah know say thats much difference scheme thing possibly huge difference use get point two six double check thats got centimeter squared thats thats one hundredth centimeter square huge amount wary certain really really want fact think really really good policy shouldnt get answer know pedantic pi pi button like know calculator dont pi yeah know sort stuck try get one pi anyway thats go working area circle possibly see next one area circle area circle area circle area circle area circle area circle area circle area circle area circle area circle area circle area circle area circle area circle area circle area circle area circle area circle area circle area circle area circle area circle area circle area circle area circle area circle area circle area circle area circle area circle area circle area circle area circle area circle area circle area circle area circle area circle area circle area circle area circle area circle area circle area circle area circle area circle area circle area circle area circle area circle area circle area circle area circle area circle area circle area circle area circle area circle area circle area circle area circle area circle area circle area circle area circle area circle area circle area circle area circle
