video going take natural base e see often l n let start thats often question natural logarithm written l engine n l well turns natural logarithm comes l n logarithmic natural ie theres l n thats natural logarithm l n rather working natural base natural logarithm need rule apply natural really special case simply log base e thats natural logarithm log base e e natural logarithm e specific one natural logarithm wrote h natural logarithm thats e x power thats going simplify x inverse way e natural log x power thats going simplify x two thing inverse sand going use fact along fact take logarithm number power let say something like log base b thats equal pull pout front p times log base b theres going times might want take number thats pull back exponent theres also times want take exponent pull front going use different order simplify look case natural base e look log e well natural logarithm power could pull power front would times natural log e well natural log remember writing definitely need clear goes remember natural log base e e well remember really mean e power e well would e first power piece right times going give see two thing undo left exponent let take look one right case times stuff exponent e natural log arent going undo point yet need get case property right except often pull exponent case going take number thats push back exponent going e e natural log x third power e natural log go away left x third right let stake look next one natural log e x minus one power could go step clear know inverse left x minus one natural log x times natural log e third power well case could take pull front natural log going take pull front going x times times natural log e well thats x times times finally last one times natural log e x take x pull front times x times natural log e stuff times x times right working natural base e natural logarithm remember special case logarithm log base e thats natural logarithm base thats number inverse use logarithm know undo right saw end two case also power pull back front push back exponent hope video helpful remember l n logarithmic net shall work hard math know great natural base e natural logarithm l n natural base e natural logarithm l n natural base e natural logarithm l n natural base e natural logarithm l n natural base e natural logarithm l n natural base e natural logarithm l n natural base e natural logarithm l n natural base e natural logarithm l n natural base e natural logarithm l n natural base e natural logarithm l n natural base e natural logarithm l n natural base e natural logarithm l n natural base e natural logarithm l n
