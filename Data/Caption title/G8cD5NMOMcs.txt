g'day I 'm James another math guy and Ihave two problems like many things in mylife but there are two problems in mymind right nowand a surprised me when I realized thatthese two distinct problems are actuallythe same problem in disguise what isabout following a tie and what is aboutsharing candy whoalet me explain here 's my tie fallingproblem I travel a great deal and I'llhave to take a tie with me and here 's aschool tie from st. Mark 's school in theBoston area go st. Mark 's all right nowwhen I wear my tie I do not like creasemarks to show when I later unpack thetime so ideally in a suitcase I 'd loveto lay out the tie perfectly flat thisway the trouble is there is no suitcasethis long for me all right so that'snormal work so the next best thing is tofold the tie in half great and lay it upthat way now I do n't like checking mybags anymore everything I do is carry-onluggageeven this turns out to be too long formy carry-on bags all right so then maybeI should fall into quarters great thatdefinitely fits in my carry-on luggagebut the trouble is when I later unfoldthe tie crease mark develops right atthis quarter mark and it shows ah don'tlike that so I figured that actuallyfalling a tie in thirds would be perfectthat gives me great length just doesn'tshow a crease mark that still fits in mycarry-on bags so the question is howdoes one fold a tie into thirds and thenmy other challenge in life is measureout a bowl of candy this is n't actuallycandy but it often happens and I want toshare this equally among three peoplewhat happens all at my life do n't ask itjust does all right now one approach ofcourse is I could actually do this countout the candy go through you know what200 pieces are only pieces that I cutthem all out very tedious divide thatnumber by 3 and give each person thatnumber of candies but I 'm amathematician mathematicians do n't likedoing how to work they all avoid hardwork at all costs that work very hard toavoid hard work so I 'm now wondering isthere a way that I could actually sharethis candy equally among three people ina way that avoid avoids actually me tocount it and then I occurred to me theseare exactly the same problem so let megive away some answers let 's first dofirst do the tie folding problem how doI fold a tie into thirdshere 's one approachI 'm gon na do is gon na make a lousyapproximation of thirds that looks likeit 's bad a bad third no way that 's thethird of the time it 's a holdupthere 's my bad approximation what I'mgonna do now is pick up the long endthat 's dangling down and bring it to myhand that 's holding the tie that createsa loop which I 'll pinch my other handand then drop everythingAHA that then gives me a new long endwhich I 'll pick up to my hand and holdI 've got another loop and I 'll drop nowthe section of time holding now islonger than I had before it 's a closeapproximation to 1/3 I stood I thinkit 's a good third so I 'm gon na do is dothis process again you pick up the longend hold grab the loop drop pick up thenew long end and all a sham see thislooks pretty quick this here lookspretty good it 's like thirds there huh Igrab the loop and drop that I claim thatis mighty close to being a perfect 1/3of the tiling the fact I can now pickthis up and for my tie in the suitcasethis way and all this grand I 'm all setmy travels great now the real questionis what 's the mathematics here why isthere work let 's talk about that butbefore that I first saw the candyproblem so let 's go through the candydemonstration next okay here 's all thecandy spilled out on a table service asyou see it 's not candy they vary piecesbut we 'll pretend it 's candy our missionhere is to select exactly one third ofthis candy without going through thetedious process of counting it all outso how do we do that well actually ifthis does mimic the tie folding problemthat we can follow that processprecisely but do it with bits of candyrather than lengths of tie here 's how itgoes first of all start by making alousy approximation of one foot I amsure that 's a lousy one third estimatehowever what did we do with the tie withour lousy estimate we took the longlength in this case the big pile andsplit in half so I split that in halfhere okay greatand I 'll bring half over to theor pass a small file great and then withthe tie we took the new long end andfold that in half speed that in halfthat corresponds to splitting this newbig pile in half again eyeballing itlots of human error bingonow if all goes well that should be amuch better approximation to one thirdof the candy than we started withactually the typhus as we do it twicelet 's do it again here listen let 's gothrough the spoke summation processtwice I 'll split the long lengths a bigpile on half again and then split thenew big pile of the along way and halfagain yes okay you see there 's lots ofhuman error here alright now this shouldbe a very good approximation to 1/3 nowyou let you in on a secret I do actuallyknow how many group pieces that are outon the board right now they 're 183 and183 divided by three is 61 so thisshould be very close to 61 pieces let'scheck it out in the kalevala so heregoes 3 3 3 and 1 makes 10 3 3 3 and oneanother 10 up to twenty three threethree and one half way there hopefullythree three three and one two fortythree three three and one fifty threethree three and one sixty one we gotexactly one third bingo this isbeautiful okay let me explain what'sgoing on I 'll do it a piece of papersthis piece of paper represents my tieand we 're done here is I 've drawn in theperfect 1/3 marks one-third totwo-thirds along the tie great so theseare the ideal fault and what we 're doingat the typhoon process or this discreteversion with candy is making a lousyfirst approximation which I 'll do okayhere 's a lousy first approximation of1/3 I 'll do it there great so there'sthe lousy approximation there 's the truecorrect value and we see you have anerror of about it looks like it 's mmmjust just a smidgen over an inch so I'min the inch off now the idea was thatwhen we fold it we should be improvingthe error so onoff by an inch and I guess the firstthought we do is from the long endeither the big pile of candy or thelonger the tie we fought that in halfand we get a new approximation and thisnew approximation is to see the creasedmonthly meters Marcus so it shows in thecamera is here which looks very close tothe ideal position so if I forward thismost should begin here 's the idealposition we 're therein fact I 've measured the error and itlooks like it 's just a smidgen over halfan inch in fact the error has reduced by1/2 now a little bit of mathematics hereyou can either do it now or just tostick your way through it you can provethat whenever you do a fold if you'reoff by some amount to begin with eachfold will reduce the error by 1/2 so ifI do it again so where 's my new longanswer here 's my new long end look atthis I 'm now at this position greatwhich is really close to the ideal 3rdlet 's do it again do the long fold onone side then the long fold on the otherside this is exactly I do with my tieand you can see that I 've now goneapproximation uh-huh I do n't even see onthe camera I can barely see myself it'sright on the side of the big black lineso actually every time you do some pollsyou 'll get creases they get closer andcloser to the ideal position where theyget half the distance each time that isbrilliant in fact what 's lovely aboutthis process there 's nothing specialabout thirds here I challenge you try tofigure out a folding process they 'll getme a tie that folds at 3/7 position lotsof stuff to think about here what 's acool stuff folding and candy sharingbrilliant and I love that this discreteversion with candy actually worked -this is goldenyouyou How to Fold or
