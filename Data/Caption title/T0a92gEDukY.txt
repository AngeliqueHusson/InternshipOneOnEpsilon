all right next thing we 're gon na do iswe 're gon na look at distributiveproperty and combining like terms and Iunderstand we 're doing one example foreach one you obviously will do many moreexamples with me if you do run intotrouble any of the examples you need togo back and look at them again and wewill practice it in class as I said butI want to make sure when I see you thatyou have a good understanding of how I'mdoing these steps so what we 're doingnow is we 're just gon na combine the twothings we 're gon na do the distributiveproperty and combining like termsalright so here 's an example as you lookat the problem you 're gon na notice thereare X 's there are numbers and there areobviously more than one of each becauseof that that means there 's gon na be acombining like terms step in herehowever also you 'll notice there'sparentheses with a number on the outsidethat tells me I 'm looking at adistributive property problem thequestion I would ask you is what do youdo first and how are you gon na rememberwhat you do first well I like to thinkof it like you guys learned about PEMDASagain I do n't like PEMDAS but since mostof you memorized it what is gon na occurfirst addition from adding things like5x to other things or multiplicationwhich is the operation for distributiveproperty you 're multiplying 4 times Xand 4 times 2 well as you remember the Mis first okay for multiplication so thefirst thing we 're gon na do is we'regonna start off by doing ourdistributive property okay so what Ilike to do at this point just like Iused to teach my students in order ofoperations is everything that 's leftover needs to be just written down belowokay and the main reason for that is sowe do n't forget it okay now we 're gonnaapply what we know about thedistributive property we 're gon na circlethe outside number and multiply it byeach of the pieces inside 4 times X is4x and 4 times 2 is 8 now we have a verysimple combining like terms problem I'mgoing to combine my 4x with my 5x noticeI 'm using the Oval method to kind ofdistinguish them as being differentnext I 'm gon na have my positive eightand my positive one which as you can see4x plus 5x equals 9x and 8 plus 1 equals9 again remember I can not take 9x plus 9right now I 've got 9 monkeys and 9snakes I ca n't make 18 monkey snakes itdoes n't work that way I just get a bunchof angry monkeys and a bunch of angrysnakes so you can not combine things thathave different variables or wholenumbers so let 's try another exampleokay as here you 'll notice that thedistributive property is right in thecenter okay notice I underlined thenegative sign and that 's importantbecause we want to make sure that we areincluding it when we do ourmultiplication step next step writeeverything that 's left over down belownow we go to the distributive propertycircling the 3 including the negativesign this is the most common mistakebecause people forget the negative signI 'm gon na multiply negative 3 times 2which is negative 6 and negative 3 times1 which is negative 3 now we employcombining like termsI 've got X 's and I 've got numbers and asyou can see doing this I end up withnegative 1x or negative x and 9 minus 3is 6I 'd like you to go ahead and try thisone on your own so pause the video andwhen you guys feel like you have theanswer go ahead and hit play what I dowant you to be careful about is I havetwo distributive properties here soyou 're gon na have to make sure you doboth of them ok so what we 're gon na donow is we 're gon na start off byitemizing both of our distributiveproperty parts on the left side and theright side first thing 3 times X is 3x 3times negative 5 is negative 15 now Imove over to the right one notice I havea positive 2 outside 2 times 4 is 8 Xand 2 times 3 isokay now at this point I need to goahead and I need to combine like termsso I 've got X 's and I 've got numbersthere are obviously more negatives here15 vs. positives with 6 so we 're gonnago ahead and combine those and get anegative 9 remember I can not turn thisinto 2x it does n't work that way okay soI wanted you to try this one on your ownas well so go ahead and pause the videogive it a try and hit play when you'reready so some of you might have gottenstuck there is no number outside theparentheses here the key is there isalways a number here and is a numbnumber 1 so in this case I have anegative 1 on the outside and I 'm goingto multiply that negative 1 times bothnegative 1 times 3 is negative 3 andnegative 1 times 7 is negative 7 now I'mgoing to combine in like term stagewhere I 've got negative 3 X 's and 10 X'sthis is where one of those exampleswhere I say the reason we circled asymbol is so instead of going negative 3plus 10 I have to remember that I canjust go 10 minus 3 which is very quicksame thing here I 've got a 12-7 I don'thave to you know overthink it I 'm justgonna go 12 minus 7 which is 5okay let 's try another one this oneagain has two distributor property startwith the one on the left based on orderof operations and then work your way tothe one on the right so first thingcircle my two multiply bolt parts okayand I get 14 X minus 8 on the other sideI want to make sure I remember that it'snot just a 9 it 's a negative 9 and I'mgonna multiply both parts and I 'm gonnaget negative 9x minus 9okay now we 're at the combining liketerms stage I 've got 14 X and negative9x 14 minus 9 is 5 and negative 8 andnegative 9 make negative 17okay go ahead and give this last one atry 4x plus 2 parenthesis 3x plus 7minus 7x pause it hit play when you'reready okay so first thing is always thedistributive property bring everythingelse down so you do n't forget about itand we 're gon na circle the two andmultiply 2 times 3 is 6x 2 times 7 is 14and now we have a whole bunch of X 's tocombine I 've got 4 plus 6 is 10 minus 7is 3 and the 14 by itself is justleftover okay so what I want you guys todo is just make sure you take the formbelow answering any questions that thatyou that I asked you and leaving anyquestions for me that you may haveyou Algebra - Distributive and Combining Like Term Part 2 Algebra - Distributive and Combining Like Term Part 2
