what we 're looking at is we'recontinuing with our year of events thatare connected to other events socomplementary events we know it 's likethis or that and they sort of match uptogether like a pair multistage eventsare sort of like a virgin ' effort onsteroids okay so what we do in manysituations like this Aquinas three timesright now you 're going to get out ofthere three results and I include themall together as one event so it 's likeone event and it 's got all thesedifferent parts in it stages right thinkthat once there but twice as they'vebeen good timesokay now the best tool you can use tohelp you understand these is aprobability trigger you seen thesebeforebut I want to remind you of what theylook like okay so if you have n't writtendown all these questions then leave abit of space but I do want you to pickup your pens now huh and draw the tree Iabout control I ca n't split three timeswhen you flip it the first time what'sthe total sample space heads or tails sothe size is 2 so the way I 'm going torepresent that is to say heads or tailsand I 'm going to represent theirbranching off because you 're getting oneor the other right so it 's like this orthis you ca n't get both at the same timebut after you flip the first head ortail in fact we might like to label thispart the first bit you then flip againyou 've got the next stage okay so let'sjust imagine for a moment but thenactually best mod imagine he 's got acoin cuz I do n't thinkhere we coins okay so I 'm gon na put thispoint right okayit 's heads its head let 's imagine thisis what 's happened okay sonafter I do this I 've got ta flip againright so again there are twoalternatives right it could be a head ora tail for the second clip okay are youwith me but of course we might not havegotten hands ISM pretty even chance thatI had gotten tails so if this hadhappened is there there 's kind of likethis alternate reality over here where Iflipped tails instead and it has its ownset of outcomes that come along with itokay so after two flips there are fourpossible things that could have happenedI could have gotten two heads in a row Icould have gotten the head tail I couldhave gotten a tail many head or both ofthem could have been tails there arefour distinct different knuckles but I'mflipping it three times right so I'mgonna do the third and for each of thesefour outcomes head head head tail tailhead tail tail I could get the head ortail tail so I 'm gon na do all of theseand I 'll try my best to fit all of themokay so you can see each of thesebranches off from one of the outcomes inthe previous stage so this is myprobability tree diagram now I willpoint out for this coin I 'm assuming itis fair right so the second one is goingto be tails againand heads again so amazing we have athree heads in a row okay but each timeI split there was going to be an evenchance of one of the other so that 's whyyou can see none of these branchesthey 're not labeled which I assume meansit 's always even okay but I could have acoin that 's designed to flip on one sidemore than the other so if I were likeit 's slightly suspicious that I gotthree days in a rowsuppose it was twice as likely to get ahead versus a tail think about that fora second if it were twice as likely toget a head and a tail it should betwo-thirds and one-third but do n't writethis because this is not actually thecaseat least those two so I could writetwo-thirds one-third which indicatesyeah there 's two outcomes but they'renot necessarily equal there was aquestion you did earlier at Hope whichsaid tomorrow why the rain would notrain does that mean there 's an evenchance 50-50 chance of it raining or notraining because what business dooutcomes two outcomes does n't meanthey 're the same pongo even if you 're ina desert or if you 're in a rain forestthe outcomes are gon na be very verydifferently probability right okay soyou can see if I want to I can labelthese I 'm not going to because they'reall even right now this thing here isgonna really help us now let 's look atthese questions rightoh do n't list the sample space now I canthink of the sample space just off thetop of my head if I want to okay but itbecomes very hard to think about it in asystematic way and make sure I don'tforget any thank you so I 'm going to usethis probability tree and then over hereon the right hand side are n't going tolist the sample space because everypossible event that could happen is allhere in my tree I 'm just going to followthe branches so let 's look at the onethat actually happened by chance I'vegot a head and then a head and then headso that is one of the optionsright if I just keep on going downthat 'll produce a nice system ate thisfor me head and then head and thenwhat 's this one head tail head tail tailand you get the idea you can fill outall of them in this way and the lovelything about using the tree is you knowyou have n't missed anything there areeight possibilities and they 're allthere okay test
