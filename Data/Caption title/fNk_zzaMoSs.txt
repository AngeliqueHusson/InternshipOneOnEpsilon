`` The introduction of numbers as coordinates is an act of violence . `` ！Hermann WeylThe fundamental , root-of-it-all building block for linear algebra is the vector , so it'sworthmaking sure that we 're all on the same page about what exactly a vector is.You see , broadlyspeaking there are three distinct but related ideas about vectors , which I 'll call the physicsstudent perspective , the computer science student perspective , and the mathematician'sperspective.The physics student perspective is that vectors are arrows pointing in space.What defines a givenvector is its length , and the direction it's pointing in , but as long as those two factsare thesame , you can move it all around and it's still the same vector.Vectors that live in the flat planeare two-dimensional , and those sitting in broader space that you and I live in are three-dimensional.The computer science perspective is that vectors are ordered lists of numbers.For example , let'ssay that you were doing some analytics about house prices , and the only features you caredaboutwere square footage and price.You might model each house with a pair of numbers : the firstindicating square footage , and the second indicating price.Notice that the order matters here.In the lingo , you 'd be modelling houses as two-dimensional vectors , where in this context , '' vector '' is pretty much just a fancy word for `` list '' , and what makes it two-dimensionalis the factthat the length of that list is 2.The mathematician , on the other hand , seeks to generalise both of these views , basicallysaying thata vector can be anything where there 's a sensible notion of adding two vectors , and multiplyingavector by a number , operations that I 'll talk about later on in this video.The details of this vieware rather abstract , and I actually think it 's healthy to ignore it until the last videoof thisseries , favoring a more concrete setting in the interim , but the reason that I bring it up here is that it hints at the fact that ideas of vectoradditionand multiplication by numbers will play an important role throughout linear algebra.But before I talk about those operations , let 's just settle in on a specific thoughtto have in mindwhen I say the word `` vector '' .Given the geometric focus that I 'm shooting for here , whenever Iintroduce a new topic involving vectors , I want you to first think about an arrow！andspecifically , think about that arrow inside a coordinate system , like the x-y plane , with its tailsitting at the origin.This is a little bit different from the physics student perspective , where vectors can freelysitanywhere they want in space.In linear algebra , it 's almost always the case that your vector will berooted at the origin.Then , once you understand a new concept in the context of arrows in space , we 'll translate it over to the list-of-numbers point-of-view , which we can do by consideringthe coordinates of the vector.Now while I 'm sure that many of you are familiar with this coordinate system , it 's worth walkingthrough explicitly , since this is where all of the important back-and-forth happens betweenthe twoperspectives of linear algebra.Focusing our attention on two dimensions for the moment , you have ahorizontal line , called the x-axis , and a vertical line , called the y-axis.The place where theyintersect is called the origin , which you should think of as the center of space andthe root of all vectors.After choosing an arbitrary length to represent 1 , you make tick-marks on each axis torepresent this distance.When I want to convey the idea of 2-D space as a whole , which you 'll seecomes up a lot in these videos , I 'll extend these tick-marks to make grid-lines , but rightnowthey 'll actually get a little bit in the way.The coordinates of a vector is a pair of numbers thatbasically give instructions for how to get from the tail of that vector！at the origin！toits tip.The first number tells you how far to walk along the x-axis！positive numbers indicatingrightwardmotion , negative numbers indicating leftward motion！and the second number tell you howfar to walkparallel to the y-axis after that！positive numbers indicating upward motion , and negativenumbersindicating downward motion.To distinguish vectors from points , the convention is to write this pairof numbers vertically with square brackets around them.Every pair of numbers gives you one and only one vector , and every vector is associatedwith one andonly one pair of numbers.What about in three dimensions ? Well , you add a third axis , called the z-axis , which is perpendicular to both the x- and y-axes , and in this case each vector is associatedwith an ordered triplet of numbers : the first tells you how far to move along the x-axis , the secondtells you how far to move parallel to the y-axis , and the third one tells you how farto then moveparallel to this new z-axis.Every triplet of numbers gives you one unique vector in space , andevery vector in space gives you exactly one triplet of numbers.So back to vector addition , and multiplication by numbers.After all , every topic in linear algebrais going to center around these two operations.Luckily , each one is pretty straightforward to define.Let 's say we have two vectors , one pointing up , and a little to the right , and the otheronepointing right , and down a bit.To add these two vectors , move the second one so that its tail sitsat the tip of the first one ; then if you draw a new vector from the tail of the first oneto wherethe tip of the second one now sits , that new vector is their sum.This definition of addition , by the way , is pretty much the only time in linear algebrawhere we letvectors stray away from the origin.Now why is this a reasonable thing to do ? ！Why this definition of addition and not some otherone ? Well the way I like to think about it is that each vector represents a certain movement！astep witha certain distance and direction in space.If you take a step along the first vector , then take a step in the direction and distance described by the second vector , the overalleffect isjust the same as if you moved along the sum of those two vectors to start with.You could think about this as an extension of how we think about adding numbers on anumber line.One way that we teach kids to think about this , say with 2+5 , is to think of moving2 steps to theright , followed by another 5 steps to the right.The overall effect is the same as if you just took7 steps to the right.In fact , let 's see how vector addition looks numerically.The first vectorhere has coordinates ( 1,2 ) , and the second one has coordinates ( 3 , -1 ) .When you take the vector sumusing this tip-to-tail method , you can think of a four-step path from the origin to thetip of thesecond vector : `` walk 1 to the right , then 2 up , then 3 to the right , then 1 down . `` Re-organisingthese steps so that you first do all of the rightward motion , then do all of the verticalmotion , you can read it as saying , `` first move 1+3 to the right , then move 2+ ( -1 ) up , '' so thenew vector hascoordinates 1+3 and 2+ ( -1 ) .In general , vector addition in this list-of-numbers conception lookslike matching up their terms , and adding each one together.The other fundamental vector operation is multiplication by a number.Now this is best understoodjust by looking at a few examples.If you take the number 2 , and multiply it by a given vector , itmeans you stretch out that vector so that it 's 2 times as long as when you started.If you multiplythat vector by , say , 1/3 , it means you squish it down so that it 's 1/3 of the original length.When you multiply it by a negative number , like -1.8 , then the vector first gets flippedaround , then stretched out by that factor of 1.8.This process of stretching or squishing or sometimes reversing the direction of a vectoris called `` scaling '' , and whenever you catch a number like 2 or 1/3 or -1.8 acting like this！scaling somevector！you call it a `` scalar '' .In fact , throughout linear algebra , one of the main things thatnumbers do is scale vectors , so it 's common to use the word `` scalar '' pretty much interchangeablywith the word `` number '' .Numerically , stretching out a vector by a factor of , say , 2 , corresponds tomultiplying each of its components by that factor , 2 , so in the conception of vectorsaslists of numbers , multiplying a given vector by a scalar means multiplying each one ofthose components by that scalar.You 'll see in the following videos what I mean when I say that linear algebra topicstend to revolvearound these two fundamental operations : vector addition , and scalar multiplication ; and I'lltalkmore in the last video about how and why the mathematician thinks only about these operations , independent and abstracted away from however you choose to represent vectors.In truth , it doesn'tmatter whether you think about vectors as fundamentally being arrows in space！likeI 'm suggestingyou do！that happen to have a nice numerical representation , or fundamentally as listsof numbersthat happen to have a nice geometric interpretation.The usefulness of linear algebra has less to do witheither one of these views than it does with the ability to translate back and forth betweenthem.It gives the data analyst a nice way to conceptualise many lists of numbers in a visual way , which can seriously clarify patterns in data , and give a global view of what certain operationsdo , and on the flip side , it gives people like physicists and computer graphics programmersa languageto describe space and the manipulation of space using numbers that can be crunched andrun through a computer.When I do math-y animations , for example , I start by thinking about what 's actuallygoing on inspace , and then get the computer to represent things numerically , thereby figuring out wheretoplace the pixels on the screen , and doing that usually relies on a lot of linear algebraunderstanding.So there are your vector basics , and in the next video I 'll start getting into some prettyneatconcepts surrounding vectors , like span , bases , and linear dependence.See you then !
