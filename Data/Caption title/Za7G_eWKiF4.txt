The marching band is holding a raffle at a football game withtwo prizes.After the first ticket is pulled out and the winnerdetermined , the ticket is taped to the prize.The next ticket is pulled out to determine the winner of thesecond prize.Are the two events independent ? Explain.Now before we even think about this exact case , let 's thinkabout what it means for events to be independent.It means that the outcome of one event does n't affect theoutcome of the other event.Now in this situation , the first event -- after the firstticket is pulled out and the winner determined -- the ticketis taped to the prize.Then the next ticket is pulled out to determine the winner ofthe second prize.Now , the winner of the second prize -- the possible winners , the possible outcomes for the second prize , is dependent onwho was pulled out for the first prize.You can imagine if there's three tickets , let 's saythere 's tickets A , B , and C in the bag.And for the first prize , they pull out ticket A.That 's for the first prize.Now , when we think about who could be pulled out for thesecond prize , it 's only going to be tickets B or C.Now the first prize could have gone the other way.It could have been A , B , and C.The first prize could have gone to ticket B.And then the possible outcomes for the second prizewould be A or C.So the possible outcomes for the second event , for thesecond prize , are completely dependent on what happened orwhat ticket was pulled out for the first prize.So these are not independent events.The second event -- the outcomes for it , are dependenton what happened in the first event.So they are not independent.The way that we could have made them independent is , after the first ticket was pulled out , if they just wrotedown the name or something , and then putthat ticket back in.Instead they taped it to the prize.But if they put that ticket back in , then the secondprize , it would have still had all the tickets there.It would n't have mattered who was picked out in the firsttime because their name was just written down , but theirticket was put back in.And then you would have been independent.So if you had replaced the ticket , you would have beenindependent.But since they did n't replace the ticket , they taped it tothe prize , these are not independent events .
