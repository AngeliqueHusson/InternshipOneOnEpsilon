video want talk little bit want talk finding formula nth term formula say find term arithmetic sequence use formula sub plus n minus sub gon na represent first term want nth term number minus common difference want talk real quick know kind real loose justification formula well use well couple couple easy problem something maybe little first video arithmetic sequence said yeah youve got sequence continue said arithmetic sequence theyre differ ing five thats value notation first term call thats generically sub one sub sub k let see kind justify formula notice said first term equal second term know equal gon na incorporate value formula could say plus well thats theyre differ ing sub youve added youve added twice could write gon na write youve added fives number get third term get fourth term would add yet another five would plus well weve got three maybe kind see pattern thing thats number front value would get three plus four times five ace six would three plus five times five maybe one ace seven would plus six times five notice relationship sixth term one value seven seventh term one six value generically look like sub n look like first term three sub one whatever term would n minus one five particular value thats know kind way could justify formula think produce real quick forgotten right let use real quick couple easy know think straightforward theyll come us suppose arithmetic use second suppose couple thing suppose find suppose want define tenth term suppose also wan ted find maybe two hundred second term find term could almost write first number thats sub sub sub sub sub would sub could write couple k value would think thats many need sub sub whoops many theres sub value use formula plugging say hey need plug first term sub case number going plug number downstairs subtract one away since well take minus multiply value said really plus times well times plus gon na give us hey thats said would get actually write way obviously sub wouldnt want wouldnt want write one way maybe would maybe masochist wouldnt want say take first term plus subtract one away number well take would multiply value particular example said five thats three plus one thousand five look like two hundred second term would maybe let one little bit little bit less straightforward suppose know arithmetic arithmetic sequence suppose know eighth term equal suppose know fourteenth term equal want couple thing couple thing let find first term let also find value particular sequence gon na problem fill generically sub eight gon na fill formula sub n equal plus n minus times gon na little certainly different ways could could find difference divide calculate value way gon na something little algebraic say well sub generically formula would first term sub minus times know equal likewise sub fill formula would first term take less dand thats gon na equal done information filling know really little system problem write one time kind little bit little bit say one plus seven got one plus equal got system equation theres lots ways solve substitution put matrix elimination addition gory detail confused one thing system system elimination addition substitution know video case gon na use substitution gon na multiply first equation negative one gon na change sign would get negative minus gon na leave bottom one alone gon na copy copy gon na add negative positive negative negative gon na give us divide sides get value know devalue one thing wan ted figure thing think looking really use either two gon na take maybe first one gon na plug value plus seven times value found three gon na plug equal times equal could subtract sides get equal longer video anticipate couple formula think know especially last one think would kind good sort question teaching student trying prepare would something little maybe ask class regard arithmetic sequence alright hope video make sense comment always feel free post hopefully somebody else point right direction arithmetic sequence formula n th term arithmetic sequence formula n th term arithmetic sequence formula n th term arithmetic sequence formula n th term arithmetic sequence formula n th term arithmetic sequence formula n th term arithmetic sequence formula n th term arithmetic sequence formula n th term arithmetic sequence formula n th term arithmetic sequence formula n th term arithmetic sequence formula n th term
