okay so in this video I want to talkabout a little bit more about arithmeticsequences I want to talk about finding aformula for the nth term and I 'm gonnaput the formula here it says to find thenth term of an arithmetic sequence weuse the formula a sub 1 plus n minus 1times D a sub 1 is gon na represent thefirst term if you want the nth term youplug in the number and minus 1 and Dagain is the common difference so I wantto talk about real quick just you knowkind of a real loose justification ofthis formula and then we 'll use it we'lldo a couple a couple easy problems andthen something maybe a little a littletrickier so in my first video aboutarithmetic sequences we said yeah ifyou 've got the sequence 3 8 13 18 23 28and if that continues we said this is anarithmetic sequence they 're differing byfive so that 's our D value just a couplethings about notation here the firstterm we call that that 's our genericallya sub one this is a sub 2 a sub 3 a sub4 etc ok so let 's see if we can kind ofjustify that formula notice okay so wesaid our first term is just equal to 3well our second term okay I know it'sequal to 8 but I 'm gon na incorporate theD value into my formula so I could sayit 's 3 plus well 5 because that 's whatthey 're differing by a sub 3well again now you 've added 5 once andyou 've added 5 twice which I could writeis 10 but I 'm gon na write it as 2 times5 you 've added 2 fives to the number 3to get to the third termto get to the fourth term we would haveto add yet another five so we would have3 plus well now we 've got three fivesand maybe you can kind of see thepattern hereAysen 5 the only thing that 's reallychanging is the number out front of theD value so we would get three plus fourtimes five ace of six would be threeplus five times fivemaybe one more ace of seven would bethree plus six times five and justnotice the relationship if we 're at thesixth term we 're using one fewer of theD value if we 're at seven the seventhterm we 're using one fewer six of that Dvalue so generically it looks like if wehave a sub n it looks like we 're usingthe first term again three is a sub onewhatever term were at we 're using onefewer so that would be n minus one andagain five in this particular sequencerepresents the D value okay so that'syou know kind of a way that you couldjustify the formula or I think produceit real quick if you had forgotten allright so let 's use this to do a coupleproblems here real quickso a couple easy ones or you know noteasy but I think about a straightforwardas they 'll come with us suppose we havethe arithmetic sequencelet 's use what we just had a second ago3 8 13 18 23 28 33 etc suppose we wantedto do a couple things suppose we wantedto find suppose we want to define thetenth term and suppose we also wanted tofind maybe the two hundred and secondterm okay to find the 10th term we couldalmost write it out so again this firstnumber that 's our a sub 1 a sub 2 a sub3 a sub 4 a sub 5 a sub 6 this would bea sub 7 so we could write out a couplemore ok our D values 5 so we would get38 4348 and then 53 I think that 's howmany I need a sub 8 a sub 9 whoops I didone too many so there 's our a sub 10 itshould be the value 48 okay if we useour formula down here again this is whatwe 're plugging in it says hey it saysyou need to plug in the first term andour a sub 1 in this case is the number 3so I 'm going to plug that in it sayswhatever number is downstairs yousubtract one away from it so since wehave a 10 here we 'll take 10 minus 1 andthen we multiply that by or our D valuewhich we said is 5 so really we 're gonnaget 3 plus 9 times 5 well 9 times 5 is45 45 plus 3 is gon na give us 48 and heythat 's what we said you would get if youactually write them all the way out soobviously a sub 202 here you wouldn'twant to you would n't want to write thisone all the way out maybe you wouldmaybe your masochist I would n't want toagain it says just take the first termwhich is 3 plus we just subtract oneaway from this numberso we 'll take 201 and again we wouldjust multiply that by our D value whichin this particular examplewe said is five so that 's three plus onethousand and five so it looks like ourtwo hundred and second term would be thenumber 1008 okay so maybe let 's do onejust a little bit a little bit lessstraightforward suppose we we know wehave an arithmetic an arithmeticsequence and suppose we know that oureighth term is equal to the numbertwenty-five and suppose we know that ourfourteenth the term is equal to 43 okayI want to do a couple things here let'sfind a couple things let 's find both thefirst term and let 's also find our Dvalue for this particular sequence okayall I 'm gon na do in this problem is justfill in what I knowokay so generically a sub eight is 25and I 'm just gon na again fill in ourformula this a sub N equals a 1 plus nminus 1 times D so this one 's gon na be alittle trickierthere 's certainly different ways youcould do this you could find thedifference and divide and calculate yourD value that way I 'm gon na do somethinga little more algebraic so it says a sub8 wella sub 8 generically from this formula itsays it would be the first term a sub 1plus 8 minus 1 which is 7 times D andagain we know that that equals thenumber 25 likewise a sub 14 if I fill inmy formula it would be the first termyou take 1 less than 14 which is 13times Dand that 's gon na equal 43 okay so whatI 've done using my information and byfilling in what I know in this formulaI 've created really a little system ofequations okay so this is what I 'm gonnawork with now in this problem so I'mgonna write it one more time here kindof a little bit a little bit down hereso it says we have a one plus seven Dequals 25we 've got a one plus 13 D equals 43 okayyou 've got a system of equations there'slots of ways to solve these substitutionyou can put in a matrix you can doelimination by addition so I 'm not gonnadiscuss this on gory details but ifyou 're confused about what I do herelook up one of those things systems ofequations solving systems of equationsusing elimination by addition orsubstitution I know I have videos onboth those so in my case I 'm gon na usesubstitution I 'm gon na multiply thisfirst equation by negative one and it'sjust gon na change the signs so I wouldget negative a 1 minus 7 D equalsnegative 25 gon na leave the bottom onealone so I 'm just gon na copy copy thatone down and now I 'm just gon na add themup the negative a 1 and the positive a 1cancel negative 7 d + 13 D is 6 Dnegative 25 + 43 is gon na give us 18 andif we divide both sides by 6 we get ourD value to be 3 okay so now we know ourdevalue that was one thing I wanted tofigure out and the other thing I thinkthat we were looking for was our a 1 andnow we can really just use either of ourequations so these are the two equationswe just played with I 'm gon na take maybethe first one and I 'm gon na plug in theD value so it saysone plus seven times our D value whichwe just found over here to be three soI 'm gon na plug that in equals 25 so a 17 times 3 is 21 equals 25 and you couldsubtract 21 from both sides and get thata 1 equals 4 okay so a longer video thanI anticipated but a couple differentthings about using this formula I thinkyou know especially this last one Ithink would be kind of a good sort ofchallenging question if you 're if you'reeither teaching or if you 're a studenttrying to prepare this to me would besomething that a little trickier tomaybe ask a class in regards toarithmetic sequences so alright I hopethis video makes some sense if you havequestions or comments as always feelfree to post them hopefully me orsomebody else can point you in the rightdirection Arithmetic Sequences: A
