right video going another example predict ing solution quadratic discriminant discriminant part square root b squared minus case weve got problem plus minus equal start plugging know quadratic formula two discriminant always need one side equation equal first thing going case simply add sides gon na plus negative plus going give us positive equal positive thats gon na value positive thats gon na b value positive c value fill b squared minus discriminant gon na end getting well b squared minus times times c also discriminant squared going times times gon na minus give us positive since discriminant positive number tell us case two real solution say two real even clarify therefore zero discriminant predict type solution quadratic equation example
